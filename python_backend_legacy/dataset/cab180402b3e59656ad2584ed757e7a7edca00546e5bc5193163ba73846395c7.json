States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\n\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.²\n\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.³\n\n¹ The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n\n² ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n\n³ Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\n\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies.⁴ However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed.⁵ Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\n\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’.⁶ China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’.⁷ Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’,⁸ but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack.⁹ The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n\n⁴ See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n\n⁵ Donald J.

The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.⁵⁶\n\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\n\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.⁵⁷\n\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM.⁵⁸ How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n\n⁵⁵ Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n\n⁵⁶ Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.⁵⁹\n\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention.⁶⁰ Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\n\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information,⁶¹ which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n\n⁵⁹ Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n\n⁶⁰ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\n\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes.

One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions.⁶⁵ To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ.⁶⁶ This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\n\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution.

The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true.⁶⁸ Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.⁶⁹ Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.⁷⁰\n\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies⁷¹ which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\n\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\n\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack.⁷² It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on.⁷³ Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.⁷⁴\n\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States.

Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\n\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76]\n\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent.

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\n\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\n\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\n\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\n\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The",

As we also said, FFMs do not apply any uniform standard, which raises questions about the applicable standard of proof. Even more critically, as indicated above, there are many difficulties in collecting and tracing cyber evidence which are compounded by the fact that an FFM cannot demand the production of evidence or use judicial or police mechanisms to obtain evidence unless this is provided in their constitutive document. What value should be placed then on secondary evidence to corroborate facts if primary evidence is hard to obtain?\n\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\n\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation.⁸⁰ Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential⁸¹ in order not to reveal\n\n⁷⁹ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc.

Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\n\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\n\nbreach of confidentiality.

We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\n\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^\n\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\n\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want.⁸⁵ For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.⁸⁶\n\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\n\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\n\non the attributing State to disclose that basis.

However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\n\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\n\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\n\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\n\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding",

As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\n\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\n\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\n\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\n\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute.

More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.⁸⁹\n\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\n\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.⁹⁰\n\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions.⁹¹ Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n\n⁸⁹ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*.

Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\n\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\n\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\n\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\n\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\n\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding.

Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\n\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\n\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\n\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n\n92 UNGA, 'Declaration on fact-finding', paras 6 and 21.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\n\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function.

It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors.

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.²\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.³\n¹ The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n² ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n³ Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies.⁴ However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed.⁵ Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’.⁶ China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’.⁷ Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’,⁸ but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack.⁹ The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n⁴ See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n⁵ Donald J.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre assessed 'with high confidence that these attacks were carried out by the GRU's Main Centre for Specialist Technologies (GTsST), also known as Sandworm and VoodooBear'.¹⁰ Russia, however, denied the allegations.¹¹ When Norway accused Russia of trying to foment discord in the country,¹² the Russian embassy responded by saying that 'as normal there are [sic] no evidence, just general speculations'.¹³ When Norway accused Russia of interference during NATO war games that took place in Norway, the Norwegian Defence Minister reportedly said: 'Russia asked (us) to give proof. We gave them the proof'; 'Russia said \"thank you, we will come back when our experts review that\"; To have such an answer from Russia is a positive thing'.¹⁴ However, Russia never came back. Also, when Norway blamed Russia for a cyberattack against its parliament in 2020, the Russian embassy branded the allegation unacceptable and claimed that no evidence was provided.¹⁵ Last but not least, the US attributed the SolarWinds hacking to\nAccording to Maria Zakharova, 'since 2015, the German side has not only failed to furnish any proof of Russia's guilt, but it has also failed to explain even once what the accusations hurled at our country are based on'. She said, 'Now, the German authorities are referring to certain \"reliable evidence\" obtained by Berlin, according to German media, from - and here's the thing - the US'. The diplomat also added that 'Russia is ready to look into the data obtained by Germany from the US regarding a cyberattack on the Bundestag in 2015, if it does exist'.\n¹⁰ Anon., 'UK and partners condemn GRU cyber attacks against Olympic and Paralympic Games', National Cyber Security Centre, 19 October 2020, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games (accessed 10 July 2022); UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office and Dominic Raab, 'UK exposes series of Russian cyber attacks against Olympic and Paralympic Games', UK Government, 19 October 2020, www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-exposes-series-of-russian-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-and-paralympic-games (accessed 10 July 2022).

This is because legal inferences and valuations are drawn from facts or, to put it differently, because facts are law-dispositive.\nWhen a dispute arises, States have an obligation to settle it peacefully.¹⁸ This obligation is fundamental because it is indispensable for maintaining international peace and security.¹⁹ States can, to that effect, employ a variety of dispute settlement mechanisms, with fact-finding being one such mechanism in and of itself or as part of another dispute settlement mechanism.²⁰\nThe question this chapter aims to answer is whether a fact-finding mechanism (FFM) to establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution claims can contribute to the peaceful settlement of an attribution dispute and facilitate\n(accessed 10 July 2022); Anon., 'Norway blames Russia for cyber-attack on parliament', BBC News, 13 October 2020, www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54518106 (accessed 10 July 2022); Catalln Clmpanu, 'Norway says Russian hacking group APT28 is behind August 2020 Parliament hack', ZDNet, 8 December 2020, www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack (accessed 10 July 2022); Reuters, \"'Flattered' Russian spy chief denies SolarWinds attack – BBC', 18 May 2021, www.reuters.com/technology/russian-spy-chief-denies-svr-was-behind-solarwinds-cyber-attack-bbc-2021-05-18 (accessed 10 July 2022).\n¹⁶ The White House, 'Fact sheet: Imposing costs for harmful foreign activities by the Russian government', 15 April 2021, www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government (accessed 10 July 2022).

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter.[21] Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.[22]\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them.[23] The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues.²⁴ For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules,²⁵ and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level.²⁶ This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law.²⁷ As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.²⁸\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n²⁴ Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n²⁵ See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

According to a survey of sixty-six missions, ‘only seventeen (25 percent) mandates included reference to “fact-finding” in their mandate, and the mandate of only one mission included reference to ascertaining the “truth”.

The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security.³⁰ According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods,³¹ or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding.³² The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM.³³ Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role.³⁴ It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms.³⁵ Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment. The UNSC can also use its mandatory\n²⁹ See, e.g., The Red Crusader Inquiry (Denmark v.

See also Chapter 11 by Nigel White in this volume.\n³⁵ For example, the UNSC established an International Independent Investigative Committee (IIIC) to examine the exact circumstances of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut. It mandated all States, including Syria, to co-operate with the IIIC and later established a special criminal tribunal to try those involved. See UNSC Res 1595 (7 April 2005) UN Doc.

The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.³⁹\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA.⁴⁰ The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.⁴¹\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs.⁴² Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n³⁶ See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan[43] and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.[44]\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'.[45] In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic',[46] whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017.[47] Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.[48]\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018.

The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.⁵⁶\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.⁵⁷\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM.⁵⁸ How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n⁵⁵ Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n⁵⁶ Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.⁵⁹\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention.⁶⁰ Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information,⁶¹ which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n⁵⁹ Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n⁶⁰ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n62 The Goldstone Report.\n63 Richard Goldstone, 'Quality control in international fact-finding outside criminal justice for core international crimes', in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), Quality Control in Fact Finding (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 46.\n64 Selectively see International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, 'Report', pp. 11-12; the Goldstone Report, p. 24; UN Human Rights Council, 'Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Libya' (8 March 2012) UN Doc.

One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions.⁶⁵ To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ.⁶⁶ This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology\nAccording to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'.⁶⁷ It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible,\n⁶⁵ Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n⁶⁶ Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), Rules 68–75.\n⁶⁷ Jonathan Law (ed.), A Dictionary of Law, 10th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nmere thoughts, intentions, fancies of the mind, propositions, when conceived of as existing or being true, are conceived of as facts. The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true.⁶⁸ Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.⁶⁹ Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.⁷⁰\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies⁷¹ which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack.⁷² It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on.⁷³ Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.⁷⁴\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States. Evidence can also be gathered from other sources such as service\n⁶⁸ James Thayer, “Law and fact” in jury trials’ (1890) 4 Harv L Rev 147–75 at 151–52.\n⁶⁹ Law, Dictionary of Law.\n⁷⁰ Richard M.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76]\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify\n[75] See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n[76] NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\n2015 Group of Governmental Experts report stated that attribution claims should be substantiated,⁷⁹ but it did not lay down any standard. As we also said, FFMs do not apply any uniform standard, which raises questions about the applicable standard of proof. Even more critically, as indicated above, there are many difficulties in collecting and tracing cyber evidence which are compounded by the fact that an FFM cannot demand the production of evidence or use judicial or police mechanisms to obtain evidence unless this is provided in their constitutive document. What value should be placed then on secondary evidence to corroborate facts if primary evidence is hard to obtain?\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation.⁸⁰ Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential⁸¹ in order not to reveal\n⁷⁹ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc.

However, this does not guarantee that there will be no\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nsensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\nbreach of confidentiality.

We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nCyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want.⁸⁵ For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.⁸⁶\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n⁸⁵ The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n⁸⁶ Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding\ncapabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\non States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency\nA proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.⁸⁹\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.⁹⁰\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions.⁹¹ Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n⁸⁹ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n⁹⁰ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n⁹¹ Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nin a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said,\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ncyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n92 UNGA, 'Declaration on fact-finding', paras 6 and 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nInsofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial,[93] technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion\nThis chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes.",

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.\n The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies. However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed. Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’. China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’. Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’, but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack. The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n Donald J.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre assessed 'with high confidence that these attacks were carried out by the GRU's Main Centre for Specialist Technologies (GTsST), also known as Sandworm and VoodooBear'. Russia, however, denied the allegations. When Norway accused Russia of trying to foment discord in the country, the Russian embassy responded by saying that 'as normal there are [sic] no evidence, just general speculations'. When Norway accused Russia of interference during NATO war games that took place in Norway, the Norwegian Defence Minister reportedly said: 'Russia asked (us) to give proof. We gave them the proof'; 'Russia said \"thank you, we will come back when our experts review that\"; To have such an answer from Russia is a positive thing'. However, Russia never came back.

As was stated in a White House brief, 'the U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service]'. Russia rejected such claims as baseless.\nBy contesting the facts, States not only challenge implicitly or explicitly the attribution claim, but they also dispute the legal claim that can be drawn from attribution, for example, a legal claim that international law has been breached and responsibility is incurred. This is because legal inferences and valuations are drawn from facts or, to put it differently, because facts are law-dispositive.\nWhen a dispute arises, States have an obligation to settle it peacefully. This obligation is fundamental because it is indispensable for maintaining international peace and security. States can, to that effect, employ a variety of dispute settlement mechanisms, with fact-finding being one such mechanism in and of itself or as part of another dispute settlement mechanism.\nThe question this chapter aims to answer is whether a fact-finding mechanism (FFM) to establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution claims can contribute to the peaceful settlement of an attribution dispute and facilitate\n(accessed 10 July 2022); Anon., 'Norway blames Russia for cyber-attack on parliament', BBC News, 13 October 2020, www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54518106 (accessed 10 July 2022); Catalln Clmpanu, 'Norway says Russian hacking group APT28 is behind August 2020 Parliament hack', ZDNet, 8 December 2020, www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack (accessed 10 July 2022); Reuters, \"'Flattered' Russian spy chief denies SolarWinds attack – BBC', 18 May 2021, www.reuters.com/technology/russian-spy-chief-denies-svr-was-behind-solarwinds-cyber-attack-bbc-2021-05-18 (accessed 10 July 2022).\n The White House, 'Fact sheet: Imposing costs for harmful foreign activities by the Russian government', 15 April 2021, www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government (accessed 10 July 2022).

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter.[21] Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.[22]\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them.[23] The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues. For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules, and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level. This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law. As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

According to a survey of sixty-six missions, ‘only seventeen (25 percent) mandates included reference to “fact-finding” in their mandate, and the mandate of only one mission included reference to ascertaining the “truth”.

Bailliet and Kjetil M. Larsen (eds.), Promoting Peace through International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 380.\n According, however, to Art 14, Hague I, the fact-finding report does not have the character of an arbitral award.\n See, e.g., the controversy surrounding the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict’ (25 September 2009) UN Doc.

FFM can alternatively be established by international organisations in relation to issues falling within their competence. The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security. According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods, or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding. The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM. Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role. It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms. Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment. The UNSC can also use its mandatory\n See, e.g., The Red Crusader Inquiry (Denmark v.

See also Chapter 11 by Nigel White in this volume.\n For example, the UNSC established an International Independent Investigative Committee (IIIC) to examine the exact circumstances of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut. It mandated all States, including Syria, to co-operate with the IIIC and later established a special criminal tribunal to try those involved. See UNSC Res 1595 (7 April 2005) UN Doc.

In order to operate under Chapter VII, the UNSC should first determine that the dispute constitutes a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression, even if the dispute has been referred to the UNSC by the States concerned. This may limit the ability of the UNSC to act because its decisions are subject to veto.\nRegarding the UNGA, it does not have expressed powers to establish FFMs, but such a power can be implied from Articles 10, 11, 14, and 22 of the UN Charter which give the UNGA general powers in peace and security and in all matters falling within the Charter. The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA. The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs. Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan[43] and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.[44]\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'.[45] In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic',[46] whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017.[47] Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.[48]\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018. The request for assistance was made in accordance\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nwith Article VIII 38(e) of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The UK government's final assessment was that it was highly likely that Russia was behind the poisoning, but this was denied by Russia.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another organisation conducting on-site inspections. These can be ad hoc, routine, or special inspections. For example, the IAEA has carried out on-site inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.\nWe should also mention here the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, whose mandate it is to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and, through its reporting and recommendations, to ensure respect of humanitarian law.

An example is the Independent Civil Society Fact-Finding Mission in Libya which was created by the Arab Organisation for Human Rights in cooperation with the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM. How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention. Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information, which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nIn addition, there is often no clear guidance as to how mandates are to be interpreted because there has been, as we said, a mandate creep and because facts cannot easily be disentangled from law. One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions. To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ. This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology\nAccording to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'. It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible,\n Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), Rules 68–75.\n Jonathan Law (ed.), A Dictionary of Law, 10th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nmere thoughts, intentions, fancies of the mind, propositions, when conceived of as existing or being true, are conceived of as facts. The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true. Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack. It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on. Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States. Evidence can also be gathered from other sources such as service\n James Thayer, “Law and fact” in jury trials’ (1890) 4 Harv L Rev 147–75 at 151–52.\n Law, Dictionary of Law.\n Richard M.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76]\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify\n[75] See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n[76] NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\n\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation. Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential in order not to reveal\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc. A/70/174, p. 13.\n Art 12, Hague I.\n OPCW Conference of the State Parties, ‘OPCW Policy on Confidentiality, in C-I/DEC.13/ Rev.2’, 30 November 2017, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2019/05/cidec13r2%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022). However, this does not guarantee that there will be no\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nsensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\nbreach of confidentiality. See OPCW Technical Secretariat, 'Report of the investigation into possible breaches of confidentiality, S/1839/2020', 6 February 2020, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/s-1839-2020%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nis subject to State consent, which poses the same challenges discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nIn order to circumvent these problems and in view of the ‘newness’ of cyberspace, several proposals were put forward envisaging the creation of an attribution agency whose mandate will be to establish facts and perform attribution. We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nCyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want. For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding\ncapabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\non States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency\nA proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions. Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nin a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said,\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ncyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nInsofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial,[93] technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion\nThis chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes.",

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.\n The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies. However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed. Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’. China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’. Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’, but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack. The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n Donald J.

When Norway accused Russia of interference during NATO war games that took place in Norway, the Norwegian Defence Minister reportedly said: 'Russia asked (us) to give proof. We gave them the proof'; 'Russia said \"thank you, we will come back when our experts review that\"; To have such an answer from Russia is a positive thing'. However, Russia never came back. Also, when Norway blamed Russia for a cyberattack against its parliament in 2020, the Russian embassy branded the allegation unacceptable and claimed that no evidence was provided.

This is because legal inferences and valuations are drawn from facts or, to put it differently, because facts are law-dispositive.\nWhen a dispute arises, States have an obligation to settle it peacefully. This obligation is fundamental because it is indispensable for maintaining international peace and security.

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter.[21] Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.[22]\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them.[23] The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues. For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules, and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level. This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law. As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

According to a survey of sixty-six missions, ‘only seventeen (25 percent) mandates included reference to “fact-finding” in their mandate, and the mandate of only one mission included reference to ascertaining the “truth”.

Bailliet and Kjetil M. Larsen (eds.), Promoting Peace through International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 380.\n According, however, to Art 14, Hague I, the fact-finding report does not have the character of an arbitral award.\n See, e.g., the controversy surrounding the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict’ (25 September 2009) UN Doc.

FFM can alternatively be established by international organisations in relation to issues falling within their competence. The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security. According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods, or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding. The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM. Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role. It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms. Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment. The UNSC can also use its mandatory\n See, e.g., The Red Crusader Inquiry (Denmark v.

See also Chapter 11 by Nigel White in this volume.\n For example, the UNSC established an International Independent Investigative Committee (IIIC) to examine the exact circumstances of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut. It mandated all States, including Syria, to co-operate with the IIIC and later established a special criminal tribunal to try those involved. See UNSC Res 1595 (7 April 2005) UN Doc.

In order to operate under Chapter VII, the UNSC should first determine that the dispute constitutes a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression, even if the dispute has been referred to the UNSC by the States concerned. This may limit the ability of the UNSC to act because its decisions are subject to veto.\nRegarding the UNGA, it does not have expressed powers to establish FFMs, but such a power can be implied from Articles 10, 11, 14, and 22 of the UN Charter which give the UNGA general powers in peace and security and in all matters falling within the Charter. The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA. The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs. Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan[43] and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.[44]\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'.[45] In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic',[46] whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017.[47] Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.[48]\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018. The request for assistance was made in accordance\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nwith Article VIII 38(e) of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The UK government's final assessment was that it was highly likely that Russia was behind the poisoning, but this was denied by Russia.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another organisation conducting on-site inspections. These can be ad hoc, routine, or special inspections. For example, the IAEA has carried out on-site inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.\nWe should also mention here the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, whose mandate it is to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and, through its reporting and recommendations, to ensure respect of humanitarian law.

An example is the Independent Civil Society Fact-Finding Mission in Libya which was created by the Arab Organisation for Human Rights in cooperation with the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM. How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention. Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information, which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nIn addition, there is often no clear guidance as to how mandates are to be interpreted because there has been, as we said, a mandate creep and because facts cannot easily be disentangled from law. One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions. To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ. This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology\nAccording to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'. It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible,\n Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), Rules 68–75.\n Jonathan Law (ed.), A Dictionary of Law, 10th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nmere thoughts, intentions, fancies of the mind, propositions, when conceived of as existing or being true, are conceived of as facts. The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true. Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack. It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on. Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States. Evidence can also be gathered from other sources such as service\n James Thayer, “Law and fact” in jury trials’ (1890) 4 Harv L Rev 147–75 at 151–52.\n Law, Dictionary of Law.\n Richard M.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76]\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify\n[75] See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n[76] NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\n\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation. Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential in order not to reveal\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc. A/70/174, p. 13.\n Art 12, Hague I.\n OPCW Conference of the State Parties, ‘OPCW Policy on Confidentiality, in C-I/DEC.13/ Rev.2’, 30 November 2017, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2019/05/cidec13r2%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022). However, this does not guarantee that there will be no\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nsensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\nbreach of confidentiality. See OPCW Technical Secretariat, 'Report of the investigation into possible breaches of confidentiality, S/1839/2020', 6 February 2020, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/s-1839-2020%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nis subject to State consent, which poses the same challenges discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nIn order to circumvent these problems and in view of the ‘newness’ of cyberspace, several proposals were put forward envisaging the creation of an attribution agency whose mandate will be to establish facts and perform attribution. We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nCyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want. For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding\ncapabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\non States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency\nA proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions. Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nin a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said,\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ncyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nInsofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial,[93] technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion\nThis chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes.",

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.\n The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies. However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed. Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’. China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’. Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’, but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack. The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n Donald J.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre assessed 'with high confidence that these attacks were carried out by the GRU's Main Centre for Specialist Technologies (GTsST), also known as Sandworm and VoodooBear'. Russia, however, denied the allegations. When Norway accused Russia of trying to foment discord in the country, the Russian embassy responded by saying that 'as normal there are [sic] no evidence, just general speculations'. When Norway accused Russia of interference during NATO war games that took place in Norway, the Norwegian Defence Minister reportedly said: 'Russia asked (us) to give proof. We gave them the proof'; 'Russia said \"thank you, we will come back when our experts review that\"; To have such an answer from Russia is a positive thing'. However, Russia never came back. Also, when Norway blamed Russia for a cyberattack against its parliament in 2020, the Russian embassy branded the allegation unacceptable and claimed that no evidence was provided. Last but not least, the US attributed the SolarWinds hacking to\nAccording to Maria Zakharova, 'since 2015, the German side has not only failed to furnish any proof of Russia's guilt, but it has also failed to explain even once what the accusations hurled at our country are based on'. She said, 'Now, the German authorities are referring to certain \"reliable evidence\" obtained by Berlin, according to German media, from - and here's the thing - the US'. The diplomat also added that 'Russia is ready to look into the data obtained by Germany from the US regarding a cyberattack on the Bundestag in 2015, if it does exist'.\n Anon., 'UK and partners condemn GRU cyber attacks against Olympic and Paralympic Games', National Cyber Security Centre, 19 October 2020, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games (accessed 10 July 2022); UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office and Dominic Raab, 'UK exposes series of Russian cyber attacks against Olympic and Paralympic Games', UK Government, 19 October 2020, www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-exposes-series-of-russian-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-and-paralympic-games (accessed 10 July 2022).

As was stated in a White House brief, 'the U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service]'. Russia rejected such claims as baseless.\nBy contesting the facts, States not only challenge implicitly or explicitly the attribution claim, but they also dispute the legal claim that can be drawn from attribution, for example, a legal claim that international law has been breached and responsibility is incurred. This is because legal inferences and valuations are drawn from facts or, to put it differently, because facts are law-dispositive.\nWhen a dispute arises, States have an obligation to settle it peacefully. This obligation is fundamental because it is indispensable for maintaining international peace and security. States can, to that effect, employ a variety of dispute settlement mechanisms, with fact-finding being one such mechanism in and of itself or as part of another dispute settlement mechanism.\nThe question this chapter aims to answer is whether a fact-finding mechanism (FFM) to establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution claims can contribute to the peaceful settlement of an attribution dispute and facilitate\n(accessed 10 July 2022); Anon., 'Norway blames Russia for cyber-attack on parliament', BBC News, 13 October 2020, www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54518106 (accessed 10 July 2022); Catalln Clmpanu, 'Norway says Russian hacking group APT28 is behind August 2020 Parliament hack', ZDNet, 8 December 2020, www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack (accessed 10 July 2022); Reuters, \"'Flattered' Russian spy chief denies SolarWinds attack – BBC', 18 May 2021, www.reuters.com/technology/russian-spy-chief-denies-svr-was-behind-solarwinds-cyber-attack-bbc-2021-05-18 (accessed 10 July 2022).\n The White House, 'Fact sheet: Imposing costs for harmful foreign activities by the Russian government', 15 April 2021, www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government (accessed 10 July 2022).

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter.[21] Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.[22]\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them.[23] The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues. For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules, and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level. This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law. As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

According to a survey of sixty-six missions, ‘only seventeen (25 percent) mandates included reference to “fact-finding” in their mandate, and the mandate of only one mission included reference to ascertaining the “truth”.

Bailliet and Kjetil M. Larsen (eds.), Promoting Peace through International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 380.\n According, however, to Art 14, Hague I, the fact-finding report does not have the character of an arbitral award.\n See, e.g., the controversy surrounding the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict’ (25 September 2009) UN Doc.

FFM can alternatively be established by international organisations in relation to issues falling within their competence. The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security. According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods, or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding. The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM. Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role. It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms. Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment. The UNSC can also use its mandatory\n See, e.g., The Red Crusader Inquiry (Denmark v.

See also Chapter 11 by Nigel White in this volume.\n For example, the UNSC established an International Independent Investigative Committee (IIIC) to examine the exact circumstances of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing in Beirut. It mandated all States, including Syria, to co-operate with the IIIC and later established a special criminal tribunal to try those involved. See UNSC Res 1595 (7 April 2005) UN Doc.

In order to operate under Chapter VII, the UNSC should first determine that the dispute constitutes a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression, even if the dispute has been referred to the UNSC by the States concerned. This may limit the ability of the UNSC to act because its decisions are subject to veto.\nRegarding the UNGA, it does not have expressed powers to establish FFMs, but such a power can be implied from Articles 10, 11, 14, and 22 of the UN Charter which give the UNGA general powers in peace and security and in all matters falling within the Charter. The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA. The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs. Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan[43] and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.[44]\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'.[45] In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic',[46] whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017.[47] Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.[48]\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018. The request for assistance was made in accordance\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nwith Article VIII 38(e) of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The UK government's final assessment was that it was highly likely that Russia was behind the poisoning, but this was denied by Russia.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another organisation conducting on-site inspections. These can be ad hoc, routine, or special inspections. For example, the IAEA has carried out on-site inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.\nWe should also mention here the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, whose mandate it is to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and, through its reporting and recommendations, to ensure respect of humanitarian law.

An example is the Independent Civil Society Fact-Finding Mission in Libya which was created by the Arab Organisation for Human Rights in cooperation with the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM. How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention. Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information, which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nIn addition, there is often no clear guidance as to how mandates are to be interpreted because there has been, as we said, a mandate creep and because facts cannot easily be disentangled from law. One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions. To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ. This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology\nAccording to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'. It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible,\n Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), Rules 68–75.\n Jonathan Law (ed.), A Dictionary of Law, 10th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nmere thoughts, intentions, fancies of the mind, propositions, when conceived of as existing or being true, are conceived of as facts. The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true. Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’. Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack. It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on. Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76]\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify\n[75] See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n[76] NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\n\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation. Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential in order not to reveal\n UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc.

However, this does not guarantee that there will be no\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nsensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\nbreach of confidentiality. See OPCW Technical Secretariat, 'Report of the investigation into possible breaches of confidentiality, S/1839/2020', 6 February 2020, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/s-1839-2020%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nis subject to State consent, which poses the same challenges discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nIn order to circumvent these problems and in view of the ‘newness’ of cyberspace, several proposals were put forward envisaging the creation of an attribution agency whose mandate will be to establish facts and perform attribution. We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nCyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want. For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding\ncapabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\non States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency\nA proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions. Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nin a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said,\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ncyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nInsofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial,[93] technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion\nThis chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes."

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.²\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.³\n¹ The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n² ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n³ Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies.⁴ However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed.⁵ Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’.⁶ China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’.⁷ Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’,⁸ but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack.⁹ The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n⁴ See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n⁵ Donald J.

We gave them the proof'; 'Russia said \"thank you, we will come back when our experts review that\"; To have such an answer from Russia is a positive thing'.¹⁴ However, Russia never came back.

This is because legal inferences and valuations are drawn from facts or, to put it differently, because facts are law-dispositive.\nWhen a dispute arises, States have an obligation to settle it peacefully.¹⁸ This obligation is fundamental because it is indispensable for maintaining international peace and security.¹⁹ States can, to that effect, employ a variety of dispute settlement mechanisms, with fact-finding being one such mechanism in and of itself or as part of another dispute settlement mechanism.²⁰\nThe question this chapter aims to answer is whether a fact-finding mechanism (FFM) to establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution claims can contribute to the peaceful settlement of an attribution dispute and facilitate\n(accessed 10 July 2022); Anon., 'Norway blames Russia for cyber-attack on parliament', BBC News, 13 October 2020, www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54518106 (accessed 10 July 2022); Catalln Clmpanu, 'Norway says Russian hacking group APT28 is behind August 2020 Parliament hack', ZDNet, 8 December 2020, www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack (accessed 10 July 2022); Reuters, \"'Flattered' Russian spy chief denies SolarWinds attack – BBC', 18 May 2021, www.reuters.com/technology/russian-spy-chief-denies-svr-was-behind-solarwinds-cyber-attack-bbc-2021-05-18 (accessed 10 July 2022).\n¹⁶ The White House, 'Fact sheet: Imposing costs for harmful foreign activities by the Russian government', 15 April 2021, www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government (accessed 10 July 2022).

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter. Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them. The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues.²⁴ For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules,²⁵ and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level.²⁶ This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law.²⁷ As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.²⁸\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n²⁴ Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n²⁵ See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security.³⁰ According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods,³¹ or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding.³² The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM.³³ Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role.³⁴ It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms.³⁵ Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment.

The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.³⁹\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA.⁴⁰ The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.⁴¹\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs.⁴² Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n³⁶ See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'. In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic', whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017. Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018. The request for assistance was made in accordance\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nwith Article VIII 38(e) of the Chemical Weapons Convention.⁴⁹ The UK government's final assessment was that it was highly likely that Russia was behind the poisoning, but this was denied by Russia.⁵⁰\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another organisation conducting on-site inspections.⁵¹ These can be ad hoc, routine, or special inspections.⁵² For example, the IAEA has carried out on-site inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.⁵³\nWe should also mention here the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, whose mandate it is to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and, through its reporting and recommendations, to ensure respect of humanitarian law.

The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.⁵⁶\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.⁵⁷\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM.⁵⁸ How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n⁵⁵ Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n⁵⁶ Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.⁵⁹\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention.⁶⁰ Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information,⁶¹ which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n⁵⁹ Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n⁶⁰ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms. Membership is often political or, at least, politicised, and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence. Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n62 The Goldstone Report.\n63 Richard Goldstone, 'Quality control in international fact-finding outside criminal justice for core international crimes', in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), Quality Control in Fact Finding (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 46.\n64 Selectively see International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, 'Report', pp. 11-12; the Goldstone Report, p. 24; UN Human Rights Council, 'Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Libya' (8 March 2012) UN Doc.

One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions.⁶⁵ To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ.⁶⁶ This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING\nFollowing a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology\nAccording to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'.⁶⁷ It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible,\n⁶⁵ Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n⁶⁶ Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), Rules 68–75.\n⁶⁷ Jonathan Law (ed.), A Dictionary of Law, 10th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nmere thoughts, intentions, fancies of the mind, propositions, when conceived of as existing or being true, are conceived of as facts. The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true.⁶⁸ Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.⁶⁹ Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.⁷⁰\nIn relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies⁷¹ which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack.⁷² It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on.⁷³ Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.⁷⁴\nIt thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States. Evidence can also be gathered from other sources such as service\n⁶⁸ James Thayer, “Law and fact” in jury trials’ (1890) 4 Harv L Rev 147–75 at 151–52.\n⁶⁹ Law, Dictionary of Law.\n⁷⁰ Richard M.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.\nConsidering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State. For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard. Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify\n See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

See Kim Zetter, 'Leaked files show how the NSA tracks other countries', The Intercept, 7 March 2018, https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/leaked-files-show-how-nsatracks-other-countries-hackers (accessed 13 July 2022); Yeager v.

Series A No. 7 at p. 19.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsuch links. This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\n2015 Group of Governmental Experts report stated that attribution claims should be substantiated,⁷⁹ but it did not lay down any standard. As we also said, FFMs do not apply any uniform standard, which raises questions about the applicable standard of proof. Even more critically, as indicated above, there are many difficulties in collecting and tracing cyber evidence which are compounded by the fact that an FFM cannot demand the production of evidence or use judicial or police mechanisms to obtain evidence unless this is provided in their constitutive document. What value should be placed then on secondary evidence to corroborate facts if primary evidence is hard to obtain?\nIn addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM\nAs explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation.⁸⁰ Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential⁸¹ in order not to reveal\n⁷⁹ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc.

However, this does not guarantee that there will be no\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nsensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. $^{82}$ Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment\nbreach of confidentiality. See OPCW Technical Secretariat, 'Report of the investigation into possible breaches of confidentiality, S/1839/2020', 6 February 2020, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/s-1839-2020%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022).\n82 'The Intelligence Community rarely can publicly reveal the full extent of its knowledge or the precise bases for its assessments, as the release of such information would reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future.

Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Background to \"Assessing Russian activities and intentions in recent US elections\": The analytic process and cyber incident attribution, 2017, www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nis subject to State consent, which poses the same challenges discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nIn order to circumvent these problems and in view of the ‘newness’ of cyberspace, several proposals were put forward envisaging the creation of an attribution agency whose mandate will be to establish facts and perform attribution. We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency\nThe creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^^\nThe underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nCyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want.⁸⁵ For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.⁸⁶\nSecond, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n⁸⁵ The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n⁸⁶ Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding\ncapabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\non States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency\nA proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.⁸⁹\nAccording to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.⁹⁰\nAlthough the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions.⁹¹ Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved\n⁸⁹ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n⁹⁰ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n⁹¹ Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nin a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said,\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ncyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n92 UNGA, 'Declaration on fact-finding', paras 6 and 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFact-Finding and Cyber Attribution\nInsofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial, technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion\nThis chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes."

States and non-State actors exploit this complex environment and the anonymity, speed, and interconnectivity it affords to cause harm. Attribution is important in such a context because it concerns the process of assigning a cyberattack to its source, which is a prerequisite for any remedial action and for establishing responsibility.\nIn international law, attribution refers to the legal process of assigning an act or omission to a State (or another subject of international law), and it is one of the constitutive elements of the law of State responsibility. A State can incur responsibility only if a wrongful act or omission is attributed to it according to the criteria established in the law of State responsibility. A cyberattack can thus be attributed to a State according to the criteria contained in Articles 4–11 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) and engage its responsibility if it constitutes a breach of one of its obligations.²\nThat said, attribution, in general, and cyber attribution, in particular, have also a factual dimension. The factual dimension of cyber attribution refers to the attribution of a cyberattack to its source based on technical facts. This requires technical investigations conducted mainly by cyber forensics experts.³\n¹ The term ‘cyberattack’ is used here generically to refer to malicious cyber operations.\n² ILC, ‘Draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts’, in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, Volume II, Part Two: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its Fifty-Third Session* (New York: UN, 2001), Art 2.\n³ Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, ‘Cyber attribution: Technical and legal approaches and challenges’ (2020) 31 EJIL 941–67.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nThe two processes of attribution (legal and factual/technical) cannot be clearly decoupled because legal attribution is fact-dependent. To explain, facts need to be discovered and assessed according to the legal criteria of attribution in order to assign a particular cyberattack to a State for legal purposes.\nIt is for this reason that attribution claims are often accompanied by reports containing supporting evidence. These reports are compiled by the State making the attribution claim, often assisted by private cybersecurity companies.⁴ However, in most cases these reports are quite thin on evidence and do not always explain how facts were assessed.⁵ Consequently, accused States, and sometimes third States, contest the attribution claims by disputing the facts and the supporting evidence.\nFor example, the US attributed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack to Russia, which dismissed it as demanding ‘some proof’.⁶ China dismissed the attribution of the intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management as ‘groundless’.⁷ Germany attributed the intrusion into its Bundestag in April 2015 to Russia on the basis of ‘hard evidence’,⁸ but, following the arrest warrant issued against a Russian operative, Russia’s First Deputy Foreign Minister said that no evidence was provided to prove his involvement in the hack.⁹ The UK and partner States attributed malicious\n⁴ See, e.g., FireEye Intelligence, ‘Anatomy of Russia’s 2016 Influence Operations’, Internet Archive, October 2017, https://archive.org/details/2017-10-fireeye-anatomy (accessed 10 July 2022).\n⁵ Donald J.

In Section 15.3, the chapter will identify several challenges fact-finding is currently facing. These two sections provide the background for the discussion that will follow in Section 15.4 of fact-finding for purposes of cyber attribution. Section 15.4 will thus explain the notion of cyber facts; discuss the legal, institutional, structural, and methodological modalities of a cyber attribution FFM; and cast a critical eye on certain proposals envisaging the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM. The chapter concludes in Section 15.5 by presenting the configuration of a cyber attribution FFM which, in the opinion of the authors, would enable it to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively and contribute to dispute settlement.\n# 15.2 FACT-FINDING AND INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT\nFact-finding as a method of dispute settlement has been recognised in the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes and is also mentioned in Article 33 of the UN Charter.[21] Its importance for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for maintaining international peace was also stressed by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in several Resolutions.[22]\nThe primary aim of fact-finding is to 'elucidate' facts underlying a dispute by locating, identifying, verifying, corroborating, and analysing them.[23] The assumption is that by resolving factual controversies, it is not only the factual\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\ndispute that will be settled, but also that legal disputes linked to the facts will be prevented, accommodated, or settled.\nAlthough fact-finding was envisaged as an objective and impartial mechanism of ascertaining facts, it evolved over the years to address a range of different situations and issues.²⁴ For example, fact-finding missions have been endowed with monitoring, alerting, and recommendatory tasks. They have also exercised adjudicative functions by identifying violations of international law or determining the applicability of specific legal rules,²⁵ and in this way, fact-finding contributed directly or indirectly to accountability at the individual or State level.²⁶ This meant that the nature of fact-finding changed from investigating facts to acquiring a juridical dimension either directly or indirectly because facts cannot be disentangled easily from law.²⁷ As a result of such changes, fact-finding has sometimes exacerbated existing disputes or triggered additional disputes about fact-finding itself.²⁸\n## 15.2.1 Forming an FFM\nThere are different routes through which FFMs can be created. In the first place, disputing States can establish an FFM based on agreement, but relevant\n²⁴ Christian Henderson, ‘Commissions of inquiry: Flexible temporariness or permanent predictability?’ (2014) 45 NYIL 287–310.\n²⁵ See, e.g., the UN Human Rights Council, ‘Commission of Inquiry in Burundi’ (5 October 2016) UN Doc.

The UN is the most active organisation in this regard due to its far-reaching competence in the field of international peace and security.³⁰ According to Chapter VI of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council (UNSC) can intervene directly or indirectly in the settlement of inter-State disputes that may endanger international peace and security. To this effect, the UNSC can call upon States to settle their disputes peacefully in which case it is for the State parties to the dispute to employ any of the available dispute settlement methods,³¹ or the UNSC can recommend an appropriate dispute settlement method which may also include fact-finding.³² The UNSC can also investigate any dispute endangering international peace and security proprio motu by establishing an FFM.³³ Fact-finding in this case plays a diagnostic and preventive role.³⁴ It allows the UNSC to take appropriate action to de-escalate the dispute or facilitate its settlement through the use of other dispute settlement mechanisms.³⁵ Moving now to Chapter VII, although the power to establish an FFM is not mentioned expressly in the UN Charter, it falls within the UNSC's implied powers under this Chapter. The UNSC can thus recommend an FFM pursuant to Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter in which case the States involved in the dispute should agree on its establishment and deployment. The UNSC can also use its mandatory\n²⁹ See, e.g., The Red Crusader Inquiry (Denmark v.

The UNGA does not, however, have binding powers, and therefore dispatching a fact-finding mission requires State consent.³⁹\nThe UN Secretary-General (UNSG) can establish an FFM if requested by States or delegated by the UNSC or UNGA.⁴⁰ The UNSG can also establish FFM proprio motu.⁴¹\nAside from these organs, other UN organs, such as the Human Rights Council, have implied powers to form FFMs.⁴² Their mandates are, however, narrower than the ones established by the UNGA, UNSC, or UNSG because they should fall within the parent organ’s competences and powers, which are more limited. For example, FFMs established by the Human Rights Council focus on human rights violations only.\n³⁶ See, e.g., in relation to Syria, UNSC Res 2118 (27 September 2013) UN Doc.

Examples include the decision of the African Commission of Human and Peoples Rights to deploy a fact-finding mission to Sudan[43] and that of the Council of the European Union to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict in Georgia.[44]\nRegarding more specialised organisations, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) stressed the 'value of the Secretariat conducting an independent investigation of an alleged use of chemical weapons with a view to facilitating universal attribution of all chemical weapons attacks' and for this reason granted its Director-General the power to 'provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organisers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons'.[45] In 2014, the OPCW deployed a fact-finding mission 'to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic',[46] whereas the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism was established in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, whose mandate expired in 2017.[47] Since then, the OPCW established the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.[48]\nThe OPCW also provided technical assistance to the UK in relation to the Salisbury incident of 2018. The request for assistance was made in accordance\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton\nwith Article VIII 38(e) of the Chemical Weapons Convention.⁴⁹ The UK government's final assessment was that it was highly likely that Russia was behind the poisoning, but this was denied by Russia.⁵⁰\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is another organisation conducting on-site inspections.⁵¹ These can be ad hoc, routine, or special inspections.⁵² For example, the IAEA has carried out on-site inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.⁵³\nWe should also mention here the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, whose mandate it is to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and, through its reporting and recommendations, to ensure respect of humanitarian law.

The objective of this fact-finding mission was to investigate widespread violations of international law in Libya.⁵⁶\nWhat all this shows is that in addition to States, a vast array of organisations – intergovernmental, nongovernmental, general, specialised – have created and deployed FFMs. Their power to do so is either expressed or implied, and such fact-finding missions are either *ad hoc* creations or permanent features of the organisation.\n## 15.2.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nA FFM’s structure and methodology includes, among others, matters concerning membership, mandates, resources, and working methods; the time-scale and territorial scope of the investigations; the type of evidence that will be used and how it will be gathered, handled, and assessed; the applicable standard of proof; and reporting and communication mechanisms. It may also include information about the applicable international law framework.⁵⁷\nThese matters are key for the proper functioning of the FFM, for the credibility, reliability, objectivity, and legitimacy of its process and findings, and eventually for the success of the FFM.⁵⁸ How they are dealt with depends on the FFM’s mandate, goals, and institutional basis; the wishes of the parties; and international law as the overarching regulatory tool – but what is important to stress is that fact-finding missions should have clear and transparent provisions to that effect.\n⁵⁵ Wolfgang Kaleck and Carolijn Terwindt, ‘Non-governmental organisation fact-work: Not only a technical problem’, in Morten Bergsmo (ed.), *Quality Control in Fact Finding* (Florence: Torkel Opsahl, 2013), p. 409.\n⁵⁶ Marina Aksenova, Morten Bergsmo, and Carsten Stahn, ‘Non-criminal justice fact work in the age of accountability’, in Morten Bergsmo and Carsten Stahn (eds.), *Quality Control in Fact-Finding*, 2nd ed.

However, international organisations have often departed from this principle by relying on their competence to establish such an FFM as provided in their constitutive treaties to which States consented.⁵⁹\nSuch an approach is formally correct but causes two main difficulties. The first concerns the legal basis upon which the FFM can perform its tasks within the disputing States. As we saw, international organisations may recommend an FFM in which case the consent of the States involved in the dispute is critical for its deployment. However, even if an international organisation has been granted the power to establish an FFM, its deployment on the territory of a particular State, or its investigations without State consent, may amount to a violation of that State's sovereignty or an unlawful intervention.⁶⁰ Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, for example, prohibits UN intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of its member States, except for Chapter VII enforcement action. Fact-finding is not, however, enforcement action, even if it is established under Chapter VII. Even if one could say that States have granted a priori consent by becoming members of an international organisation, and even if the organisation can instruct States to accept the deployment of an FFM, if States oppose its actual deployment, the only option is to enforce the deployment of the FFM, something that may require military support.\nThis leads to the second difficulty which relates to the effectiveness of fact-finding. If States give their consent, the FFM will be able to access and gather information,⁶¹ which will make its work and findings more credible and reliable. In contrast, if States are forced to admit an FFM, they may obstruct its work or fail to co-operate fully. If States refuse to admit an FFM or refuse access to certain sources, an FFM may be forced to gather evidence from secondary or external sources, which may impact the reliability and credibility\n⁵⁹ Rob Grace, ‘From design to implementation: The interpretation of fact-finding mandates’ (2015) 20 JC&amp;SL 27–60 at 31; Alexander Orakhelashvili, ‘Commission of inquiry and traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement’, in Christian Henderson (ed.), Commissions of Inquiry: Problems and Prospects (London: Bloomsbury, 2017), p. 130.\n⁶⁰ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

If its credibility and reliability are questioned, fact-finding will not only fail in its purpose, but it can aggravate an existing dispute or even add another layer to an existing dispute involving the fact-finding mission itself.\n# 15.3.2 Fact-Finding Structure and Methodology\nAs said before, having a clear and transparent structure and methodology is important, but existing practice indicates that FFMs are often deficient in this regard. For example, mandates or working methods are not always stated in clear or explicit terms.[62] Membership is often political or, at least, politicised,[63] and, more critically, the expertise or the capacity of members to handle complex facts is often questioned.\nFurthermore, FFMs do not always state which standard of proof they apply when assessing evidence, and different commissions apply different standards. They include, inter alia, standards of reasonable suspicion, reasonable grounds, sufficient credible and reliable information, and sufficiently substantiated and overwhelming evidence.[64] Even if variation is to be expected given that each FFM is an independent institution having its own mandate, stating what is the applicable standard and applying it consistently is critical for the reliability and credibility of the fact-finding process and determinations, particularly if they are used for accountability purposes. Otherwise determinations may be contested or used arbitrarily by one of the parties to reaffirm its own version of facts.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Nicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton In addition, there is often no clear guidance as to how mandates are to be interpreted because there has been, as we said, a mandate creep and because facts cannot easily be disentangled from law. One can say that because the instrument establishing an FFM is an international law instrument, international law provides the requisite interpretative context. However, due to the diverse composition, mandates, and institutional allegiances of FFMs, but also due to existing interpretative variations in international law, the interpretation or application of international law often differs among FFMs or between them and other international law institutions.⁶⁵ To give an example, which facts should be collected and which facts should be considered relevant in establishing a cyber armed attack depends on how an armed attack is legally defined, in general, and by the FFM, in particular, but views differ.⁶⁶ This state of affairs is particularly worrying when FFMs perform adjudicatory functions or when individual or State responsibility is explicitly or implicitly invoked based on facts. As a result, disputes may arise about the FFM's international law interpretations, which can extend to disputes over the determination of the underlying facts. What is more worrying, though, is the systemic effects of the international law interpretations conducted by FFMs, because they can increase the unpredictability of international law rules.\n## 15.4 CYBER ATTRIBUTION AND FACT-FINDING Following a short presentation of fact-finding, this section discusses the contours of fact-finding in the context of cyber attribution. More specifically, it considers what types of facts are pertinent for cyber attribution purposes and the methodology a cyber attribution FFM should apply to ascertain the facts. It then considers how such an FFM can be established, and, in this respect, it also assesses the proposed cyber attribution mechanisms.\n## 15.4.1 Cyber Facts and Cyber Fact-Finding Methodology According to the Dictionary of Law, a fact is 'an event or state of affairs known to have happened or existed'.⁶⁷ It was also said about 'facts' that 'the fundamental concept is that of a thing as existing, or being true. It is not limited to what is tangible, or visible, or in any way the object of sense; things invisible, ⁶⁵ Henderson, 'Commissions of inquiry', p. 306.\n⁶⁶ Michael N.

The question of whether a thing be a fact or not, is the question of whether it is, whether it exists, whether it be true.⁶⁸ Facts are ascertained by evidence, defined as ‘that which tends to prove the existence or nonexistence of some fact’.⁶⁹ Consequently, facts can be established on the basis of direct evidence, but they can also be derived from the evaluation or interpretation of facts through inferences or presumptions.⁷⁰ In relation to cyber attribution, the notion of facts differs in certain respects from the types of facts that FFMs usually ascertain. FFMs usually ascertain physical facts by relying on physical, observable evidence, or testimonies⁷¹ which they retrieve from on-site visits, investigations, and interviews with people.\nAlthough facts ascertained through such evidence and methods are also relevant to cyber attribution in order, for example, to determine the physical location of cyberattacks or their effects, the bulk of cyber facts are technical. They are also ascertained on the basis of technical evidence following technical (forensic) investigations.\nTechnical evidence consists of artefacts drawn from the tools, techniques, and procedures used for the cyberattack.⁷² It includes, among others, command-and-control servers, IP addresses, websites, activity logs, time stamps, malware and their design, names, and pseudonyms, software programmes, e-mails, instructions, language strings, documents, and so on.⁷³ Technical evidence can be collected through technical investigations from different points of the cyberattack cycle: preparation, reconnaissance, exploitation, execution, and post-execution phase.⁷⁴ It thus becomes evident that the bulk of investigations to find such evidence will be carried out within the victim State’s networks and cyber infrastructure, or within networks or cyber infrastructure belonging to a threat actor or third States. Evidence can also be gathered from other sources such as service ⁶⁸ James Thayer, “Law and fact” in jury trials’ (1890) 4 Harv L Rev 147–75 at 151–52.\n⁶⁹ Law, Dictionary of Law.\n⁷⁰ Richard M.

This is due to the interconnectedness of networks and the private ownership of cyber infrastructure. Other evidence, including non-technical evidence, can be collected from within the jurisdiction of the victim State but also that of third States.\nGiven that threat actors often hide or fake their identity or use deceptive tools to cover up their traces, the tactics, techniques, and tools[75] used for a cyberattack are often compared in order to identify common traits and attribute the attack to a particular actor.[76] Considering the above, a cyber attribution FFM should first perform technical attribution, but, unless the mandate of the FFM is strictly limited to establishing the disputed technical facts, technical attribution is not sufficient in itself to attribute a cyberattack to a State because there is a difference between identifying facts and assigning them to a computer, and assigning them to a State. What is needed in this case is to link the technical facts to an individual, group, or entity and then link the individual, group, or entity to a particular State.[77] For this to happen, more and different types of facts need to be gathered and assessed. For example, documents, legislation, or administrative acts can be used as evidence in this regard.[78] Yet, the links between threat actors (individuals or groups) and States are not always formal or apparent. For this reason, all source intelligence should be used to identify [75] See Catalln Clmpanu, 'US Cyber Command starts uploading foreign APT malware to VirusTotal', ZDNet, 8 November 2018, www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal (accessed 13 July 2022); Anon., 'NSA and NCSC release joint advisory on Turla Group Activity', CISA, 21 October 2019, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/10/21/nsa-and-ncsc-release-joint-advisory-turla-group-activity (accessed 13 July 2022).\n[76] NCSC and NSA, 'Advisory: Turla group exploits Iranian APT to expand coverage of victims', NCSC, 21 October 2019, www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims (accessed 13 July 2022).

This includes information collected from open sources such as the internet or social media, human sources, and signals intelligence, such as intercepted messages.\nAll this indicates that fact-finding for cyber attribution purposes is a more holistic process. It has a strong technical component in that the facts and methods according to which facts are located, retrieved, ascertained, and assessed are primarily technical, but other non-technical facts should also be factored in.\nInevitably, this poses many challenges to fact-finding. A primary challenge is jurisdictional and refers to the ability and competence of the FFM to access evidence. Although, arguably, using cyber means and methods facilitates investigations — because it extends their reach, makes access to cyber evidence easier by not requiring physical presence, and surpasses impediments caused by geography, war, or unrest — legal jurisdictional impediments still exist. Investigations, even remote ones, require direct access to networks, and, therefore, the consent of the State or party that owns the network is needed, but access may be denied or restricted. Moreover, investigations may need to take place outside the jurisdiction of the disputing States because of the interconnected nature of cyber infrastructure and the ability of threat actors to operate from within different jurisdictions. If consent is denied, withdrawn, or restricted, fact-finding (on-site or remotely conducted) will be hindered. If the FFM carries out investigations without State consent, it may face accusations of having violated international law. If, in the absence of a direct access, it relies on external and secondary sources, the credibility, reliability, and legitimacy of its findings may be contested.\nBesides jurisdictional limitations, another challenge concerns the diagnostic capacity of the FFM. For example, the FFM will need to have the appropriate technical resources, know-how, and skills in order to be able to gather and assess technical evidence. If such resources are not available or are limited, the FFM will not be able to perform these tasks efficiently or with the required degree of confidence. The immediate question is whether, in order to overcome this challenge, fact-finding can be delegated to expert third parties such as private security companies. If technical fact-finding is delegated to third parties, questions about the neutrality and impartiality of fact-finding may be raised, alongside questions about the credibility and reliability of the findings because of the inability of the FFM to scrutinise the determinations of third parties due to lack of resources, knowledge, and expertise.\nThis leads to another challenge, which concerns the applicable methodology. FFMs have their own rules, standards, and methods of identifying, analysing, establishing, ascertaining, probing, and using facts. The Nicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton In addition, the timescale within which the FFM can deliver its report is also important. Cyber fact-finding may take longer because of its complexity, the technical resources required due to the pace of developments in this area, and the jurisdictional hurdles that must be overcome. A thorough but longer investigation may increase the reliability and credibility of fact-finding, but may undermine its functions in cases where a swift action is needed. A faster fact-finding process may be more useful but less reliable. If a fact-finding mission's report is issued after action has been taken, it may reignite and escalate the dispute.\n## 15.4.2 Creating a Cyber Attribution FFM As explained in Section 15.2, there are different ways according to which a cyber attribution FFM can be established. In the first place, the States involved in a cyber attribution dispute can create an FFM. In doing so, States can configure its composition, mandate, and methodology. State consent can, in principle, enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of FFMs because it will engender cooperation.⁸⁰ Yet, States may put forward national security or other justifications to limit the scope of their cooperation because, as we said, the investigation is internal to a State's cyber infrastructure. For instance, States may deny or limit access to the components of their cyber infrastructure or certain data. They may also demand that the investigation and the mission's findings remain confidential⁸¹ in order not to reveal ⁷⁹ UNGA, ‘Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ (22 July 2015) UN Doc. A/70/174, p. 13.\n⁸⁰ Art 12, Hague I.\n⁸¹ OPCW Conference of the State Parties, ‘OPCW Policy on Confidentiality, in C-I/DEC.13/ Rev.2’, 30 November 2017, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2019/05/cidec13r2%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022). However, this does not guarantee that there will be no https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Fact-Finding and Cyber Attribution sensitive information or vulnerabilities. Since the attribution may also require other information, States may withhold such information or manipulate the available information. Even if States would co-operate, the FFM may need to extend its investigation into other States' networks, but these States may deny or limit such access. As a result, its work may be obstructed, and the credibility and reliability of its findings may be contested.\nAnother way of establishing an FFM is through the UNSC based on its Chapter VI and VII powers. As we said in Section 15.2, a Chapter VI FFM requires State consent as does an FFM established under Article 40 of the UN Charter pursuant to a UNSC recommendation. For an FFM binding under Chapter VII, the UNSC should qualify the cyber attribution dispute as a threat to international peace. This requires the affirmative vote of the permanent members, which may not be forthcoming in view of the fact that they are involved in acute cyber antagonism. That withstanding, a question that may also be asked is whether a cyber attribution dispute can reach such a level of seriousness and intensity and acquire an international dimension as to fall within the Article 39 qualifiers. Although the UNSC has discretionary powers in this respect, existing disputes over cyber attribution indicate that they hardly reach such a level, although this may change in the future. The UNSC can instead qualify as a threat to peace, the underlying dispute of which the cyber attribution dispute is just an aspect. For example, a dispute over territory or a military dispute may also have a cyber attribution dimension. In such instances, cyber attribution fact-finding may not be necessary because what is mainly needed is to settle the main dispute or to investigate the facts underlying the main dispute. Considering the above, it can be said with reason that a UNSC-created cyber attribution FFM is equally a quite remote possibility. Regarding the UNGA, as we said, it can recommend the establishment of a cyber attribution FFM, but its actual establishment and deployment breach of confidentiality. See OPCW Technical Secretariat, 'Report of the investigation into possible breaches of confidentiality, S/1839/2020', 6 February 2020, www.opcw.org/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/s-1839-2020%28e%29.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Nicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton is subject to State consent, which poses the same challenges discussed in the preceding paragraph.\nIn order to circumvent these problems and in view of the ‘newness’ of cyberspace, several proposals were put forward envisaging the creation of an attribution agency whose mandate will be to establish facts and perform attribution. We are not going to consider the merits of each proposal, but rather categorise these proposals into those envisaging an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency and those envisaging a private cyber attribution agency and assess them accordingly.\n# 15.4.2.1 Intergovernmental Cyber Attribution Agency The creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency was proposed by the Atlantic Council. More specifically, it proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) with mixed (public and private) membership.^[83]^ The underlying idea is that an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency grounded on State consent and operating on the basis of agreed standards and processes will overcome States’ reservations and legitimise its standing, operation, and findings. Whether an international intergovernmental attribution agency is viable at this moment in time is doubtful.\nFirst, States treat cyber attribution as a sovereign prerogative and have repeatedly said that they have no obligation to disclose evidence.^[84]^ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Fact-Finding and Cyber Attribution Cyberspace is also a strategic domain where States pursue goals such as prevention or deterrence, or more specific political, military, or economic interests. In such an environment, the role of a permanent international FFM is quite peripheral in States' thinking because it may restrict their freedom to attribute when they want and for the reasons they want.⁸⁵ For example, in a situation of inter-State conflict or tensions, a State may decide not to attribute, even if it possesses the relevant facts, in order not to aggravate the situation, avoid domestic pressure to take action, or not to attract retaliation. In contrast, a State may decide to attribute, even if it does not hold all the facts, if important interests are endangered and the State has decided to act. As Nicolas Politis has observed, fact-finding was envisaged for disputes where the essential interests of a State were not at stake.⁸⁶ Second, States have asymmetric cyber capabilities, with certain States having very sophisticated and robust attribution technologies and mechanisms. Consequently, the benefits of an agency performing attribution on their behalf are negligible, and there are no benefits in sharing their attribution technology with such an agency which will then antagonise them.\nThird, the findings of such an agency, but also any legal conclusions that can be inferred, may be contested due to the absence of a firm legal framework regarding the scope and content of States' international law obligations in cyberspace, or due to the controversies surrounding the attribution criteria in the law of State responsibility. For example, what constitutes a cyber armed attack, whether sovereignty is a rule that applies to cyberspace, and whether 'overall control' is an attribution criterion are subject to debate. As a result, such controversies will lead to further controversies about the type and calibre of evidence and the applicable standard of proof.\non the attributing State to disclose that basis. However, a State may choose as a matter of policy to disclose specific information that it considered in making its attribution decision, and may be required to defend any such decision as part of international legal proceedings'; Switzerland, 'Switzerland's position paper on the application of international law in cyberspace, Annex UN GGE 2019/2021', www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/20210527-Schweiz-Annex-UN-GGE-Cybersecurity-2019-2021_EN.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 6: 'The decision to attribute conduct is at the discretion of the injured State and there is no obligation under international law to disclose the information leading to such a decision.'\n⁸⁵ The UK, for example, will 'attribute specific cyber identities publicly', when it is judged 'in the national interest to do so'. HM Government, 'National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021', UK Government, 2016, https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf (accessed 14 July 2022), p. 50 at s. 6.3.3.\n⁸⁶ Nicolas Politis, 'Les commissions internationales d'enquête' (1912) 19 RGDIP 149–88 at 153.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Fourth, such an agency is compared to existing international mechanisms performing inspection and verification functions, such as those under the IAEA or OPCW. However, there is a critical difference between them and the proposed agency. Whereas the IAEA and OPCW have established a comprehensive regulatory regime where inspections are integral to securing compliance with States' obligations, no such regime exists for cyberspace to which fact-finding can be attached.\nAll these issues make the creation of an intergovernmental cyber attribution agency quite unlikely, at least in the foreseeable future. However, even if such an attribution agency is eventually created, it will still confront several challenges.\nIts membership will most likely be limited due to States' diverse cyber capabilities and the rivalry that currently characterises their relations. Technologically developed States or cyber powers, in general, may chose to remain outside such an agency because of the limited benefits they will receive. This immediately raises questions about the agency's resources and its mandate. If the agency's resources are inadequate, will its mandate be limited and, in this case, what will be its added value? If important cyber powers are not members, will its findings be reliable and credible? Also, what will be its leverage to conduct investigations into third States, or States that have isolated their cyberspace? If technologically developed States do participate, would that create an imbalance and invite accusations of bias regarding its findings? If a State is frequently accused of cyberattacks, is there any benefit in participating in such an agency?\nAn intergovernmental cyber attribution agency will also face certain methodological challenges, such as regarding the criteria according to which attribution incidents will be investigated and the type of attribution it will perform, for example, technical and/or legal. These issues need to be determined in advance, but it is doubtful whether that will be possible due to the permanent and general competence of such an agency, the dynamic nature of cyber incidents, the difficulty in disentangling law from facts, and the inherent power of institutions to interpret and determine their mandate in view of new circumstances.\nAnother critical question is who will conduct the fact-finding. If fact-finding is to be performed by State officials, the process may be politicised. If it is to be performed by the agency's staff, recruited because of their qualifications and professional experience, the agency will need to build its own fact-finding capabilities and expertise, but the immediate question is who is going to provide the resources, know-how, and training. As we said, States may be reluctant to share their technical attribution tools and knowledge, and, in general, they may not be ready to support and fund the development of attribution expertise by such an agency which can then compete with them. If investigations or capacity-building is delegated to third parties, such as the private sector, instead, it may affect the legitimacy, impartiality, and reliability of an agency, as mentioned previously.\nOther methodological challenges include the applicable standard of proof; the legal framework governing the agency's investigations such as human rights law or intellectual property law; the availability of review mechanisms; and the manner in which and to whom findings will be communicated, for example, whether they will be made public or remain confidential.\nHow an agency will make decisions presents another challenge. Consensus-based decisions may be more acceptable, but trying to build consensus may impact the ability of the agency to make quick decisions, or may affect the quality and transparency of its decisions. If decisions are majority-based, division and accusations may follow.\nEnsuring the accountability of such an agency is another challenge. Its findings may be relied upon by States to act, which raises the question of whether the agency can be held responsible for incorrect determinations, or for assisting in the commission of unlawful acts. If a State, for instance, relies on the agency's findings to take countermeasures against another State which contends that the countermeasures were unlawful because the attribution was mistaken, can the agency be held responsible for incorrect findings, or for aiding in the commission of wrongful acts? If the matter is brought before a court or an arbitration tribunal, what value should be placed on the findings of such an agency? For example, should that court or tribunal treat them as mitigating circumstances when considering damages?\nThere is also the fundamental question of the status of the agency. If it is consultative, its contribution to dispute settlement may be negligible because States may employ other mechanisms or use their own judgment to settle their cyber attribution disputes. However, even in this case, there is still a danger of aggravating an existing dispute because its findings, even if non-binding, may be used by States to validate or disprove attribution claims, thus providing no closure to the dispute. If its status is adjudicatory and its findings are binding Nicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton on States, this would require transparent working methods but also accountability, which pose their own challenges, as mentioned above.\n## 15.4.2.2 A Private Cyber Attribution Agency A proposal for the creation of a private cyber attribution agency was put forward by RAND. More specifically, it proposed the creation of a Global Cyber Attribution Consortium whose role would be to attribute major cyberattacks with a high degree of confidence and release the evidence and its findings to the public.⁸⁹ According to the proposal, the agency's membership will be multi-stakeholder, consisting of technical, legal, and policy experts from academia, research organisations, and cybersecurity and information technology companies, but State representatives will be excluded. The agency will also follow a standardised methodology regarding the collection of evidence, assessment, standard of proof, review, notification, and publication of findings.\nIt is claimed that the private character of such an agency will remove suspicions of politicisation, and its findings will contribute to dispute settlement by making attribution neutral, credible, and reliable. According to RAND, the consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from 'the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings'.⁹⁰ Although the proposal tries to circumvent State reluctance or suspicion towards an intergovernmental attribution agency, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate and viable to exclude States to the extent that attribution determinations, even if they are exclusively factual, may affect State interests and decisions or have legal consequences, for example, the imposition of sanctions.⁹¹ Questions may also be asked about the competence and ability of such an agency to conduct investigations when States involved ⁸⁹ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*. Microsoft has also put forward various proposals, but their nature is not clear. It first proposed a non-governmental organisation made up of experts. See Microsoft, 'An attribution organization to strengthen trust online', https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW67QI (accessed 14 July 2022). Later it proposed an international organisation with public-private membership to investigate technically nation State attacks resembling the IAEA. Scott Charney et al., 'From articulation to implementation: Enabling progress on cybersecurity norms', *Microsoft*, June 2016, https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/REVmc8 (accessed 14 July 2022).\n⁹⁰ Davis et al., *Stateless Attribution*, p. 30.\n⁹¹ Council of the European Union, 'Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1127 of 30 July 2020 amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 concerning restrictive measures against cyber-attacks threatening the Union or its Member States' 2020 OJ (L246) 12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press in a dispute refuse to co-operate. The private character of such an agency does not ensure that States will co-operate or disclose information. Furthermore, depending on how information is gathered, handled, assessed, and communicated by such an agency, the credibility and reliability of its findings can be challenged for lack of evidence or faulty methodology.\nThere are several other challenges facing a private attribution agency. First, whereas the participation of private security companies can boost the technical capabilities of the agency, how they will be selected is critical for the credibility of the agency. Secondly, these companies will continue to operate independently and often compete with the agency, which will raise questions about their commitment to the work of the agency. Third, in a competitive cybersecurity market, other private cybersecurity companies may challenge the agency's findings, which can create confusion and lower the level of confidence in the agency. Fourth, the private sector is not equally developed in all States, and States have different views about its role in cyber governance, which may create suspicion or even opposition to the involvement of the private sector.\nAnother challenge concerns the accountability of this agency for the same reasons mentioned above, but with an additional twist. If the agency does not operate under international law, it will not be subject to international law's accountability mechanisms. This immediately raises the question of whether national accountability mechanisms will be used against the agency or its individual members. If that is to happen, it will have a chilling effect on the agency and create confusion and uncertainty.\nFinally, the private character of such an agency may pose a systemic challenge to international law because it will antagonise or even undermine States which, as we said, want to preserve their power to perform attribution and settle their disputes as they see fit. Such an agency may also undermine States' control over the international law process of rule creation, application, and interpretation if it is involved, explicitly or implicitly, in the interpretation or application of international law or in laying down new standards. In addition, another systemic challenge should be mentioned. The proliferation of attribution mechanisms may cause more confusion and conflict and aggravate disputes further instead of settling them.\nAll this means that such an agency's claim to neutrality, reliability, and legality may not be fully supported.\n## 15.5 Moving forward: an ffm for cyber attribution?\nIn the preceding sections, we identified several institutional, structural, and methodological challenges that affect cyber attribution fact-finding. That said, Nicholas Tsagourias and Fiona Middleton cyber attribution disputes exist and, if not settled, may aggravate or exacerbate the underlying political and legal disputes. Thus, the question of how to establish the facts underlying a cyber attribution claim cannot go away. For this reason, in this section we will present the key features and attributes of a cyber attribution FFM which, in our opinion, could address many of the aforementioned challenges.\nIn the first place, such an FFM should be created by States voluntarily and on an ad hoc basis in relation to a particular cyber attribution dispute.92 States' involvement in its creation and design will demonstrate their determination to settle the attribution dispute. It will also elicit their cooperation and compliance since the FFM will be entangled with the particular interests and expectations of the disputing States. Finally, it will contribute to the credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness of the FFM. This does not contradict what we said previously, namely that States view cyber attribution as their sovereign prerogative and claim that they have no obligation to disclose evidence, or that they use attribution for strategic purposes. These remain true, but they are more pertinent in relation to fact-finding performed by permanent international institutions over which disputing States have little control, or in relation to demands to publicly disclose information. However, if States determine that settling a cyber attribution dispute is more important than letting the dispute linger or aggravate, and that settling it through an FFM is appropriate, effective, and serves their interests, they may go ahead to create such an FFM and co-operate with it. As a matter of fact, this is not against their sovereignty but confirmation of their sovereignty.\nFrom a broader perspective, this approach to FFMs accords with the fact that States are the primary creators and designers of dispute settlement mechanisms, and that fact-finding was originally envisaged as a bilateral mechanism of dispute settlement and not as an institutional one.\nSince being created by States, the FFM should be treaty-based. States will thus be able to specify in its constitutive instrument its composition, mandate, and methodology.\nThe composition of the FFM should be determined by the States concerned, depending on the nature and mandate of the FFM. Members can be State officials, staff borrowed from international organisations, individuals drawn from the private sector, or NGOs. Their expertise can also cover different fields, for example, technology and/or law. We are thus not prescriptive as existing proposals are, and we do not place value on a certain type of membership, but believe that membership should reflect the interests and needs of the States which establish the FFM.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Fact-Finding and Cyber Attribution Insofar as its mandate is concerned, it should again be determined by States. In the first place, the constitutive instrument should specify the subject matter of the investigation. It should specify, for example, which incident(s) will be investigated and under what circumstances other related incidents will be investigated. It should also specify what type of facts it will gather and assess, and whether the FFM will perform only technical and/or legal attribution. This is important because it has implications for the methodology the FFM will follow. In addition to the above, the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify the location of the investigations, for example, which and whose networks it will investigate, and under what circumstances it will extend its investigations to connected networks. It should also specify the timeframe of investigations; the processes and conditions of gathering, storing, handling, or sharing evidence; the process according to which evidence will be assessed; and the means of establishing their authenticity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the constitutive instrument should specify the applicable standard of proof depending on the type of attribution it will perform, and whether the FFM will have an adjudicatory or consultative function. It should also state how and by whom its findings will be reviewed.\nThere are several other issues that the FFM's constitutive instrument should specify. It should specify the terms and words used in the mandate, such as attribution, networks, and non-State actors. It should specify the guiding principles of the FFM, for example, its adherence to the principles of transparency, fairness, neutrality, and accountability. It should specify the law that will apply to the FFM and its investigations, for example, whether the investigations will be conducted according to international law.\nRegarding the decision-making process, the constitutive instrument should state whether decisions will be consensual or majority-based. It should also explain the reporting and communication process, including whether the findings will remain private and confidential, or made public, and whether, in the latter case, evidence will be made public. This is important because it will have implications on the applicable methodology.\nThe constitutive instrument should make provisions for a continuous supply of financial,[93] technical, or any other resources required for the performance of the FFM's duties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781009076296.023 Published online by Cambridge University Press Finally, the constitutive instrument should establish internal and/or external accountability mechanisms.\nWe believe that, if States create a cyber attribution FFM which addresses all these issues with the requisite care, the FFM will be able to operate smoothly and efficiently and establish the facts underpinning cyber attribution disputes in a credible and reliable manner. It can thus contribute to dispute resolution without becoming itself the subject of a dispute.\n### 15.6 conclusion This chapter has considered the role of fact-finding as a mechanism for settling cyber attribution disputes. In this respect, it discussed its merits but also identified several challenges it is facing relating to its legal basis, institutional nature, structure, and methodology. The chapter then went on to present certain key features a cyber attribution FFM should exhibit, which will enable it, in the view of the authors, to perform its fact-finding tasks effectively. In our opinion, if fact-finding is calibrated appropriately, it can contribute to the peaceful settlement of cyber attribution disputes."
