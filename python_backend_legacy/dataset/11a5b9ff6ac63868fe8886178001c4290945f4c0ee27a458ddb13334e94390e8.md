Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n***\nIn today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means. The general public's reliance on digital\nHON-MIN YAU (姚宏旻) is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate Institute of Strategic Studies (GISS), War College, National Defense University, Taiwan.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn (Bright, 2007). Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first \"fire and forget\" cyberweapon (Milevski, 2011, p. 64). Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as \"left of launch,\" to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated (Stoddart, 2016, p. 833). Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of \"deterrence\" in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\" 2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity (Lin, 2018), and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting \"cybersecurity as the national security\" (Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nBy July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” (MND, 2019, p. 69) as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence” (MND, 2017, p. 38).\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt . . . opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-3\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n# Deterrence Theories\n## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace\nIn the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action (Geers, 2010; Jervis, Lebow, &amp; Stein, 1989).\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists (Libicki, 2009), and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter (Glaser, 2011)? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response (Yau, 2015) and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust (Jasper, 2015). In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured (Yau, 2019b). Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire” (Libicki, 2009).\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace\nClassic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nThis is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression (Mazarr, 2018; G. H. Snyder, 1959).\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers (Ghosh, 2016; Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors (Berghel, 2017). The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,”\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-5\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\"active cyber defense,\" \"entanglement,\" and \"norms\" to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as \"hack back,\" is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include \"entanglement\" and \"norms\" as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the \"naming and shaming\" approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia\nWhen we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by \"defense,\" implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely \"cyber defense\" method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\" the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization (MND, 2019, p. 40), and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that: \"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and\n2040011-6\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\ncontrol” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method (Morgan, 2003, pp. 15–20). Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology (Chee, 2019) and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology (Dai, 2019). As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-7\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nto the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction” (Lebow, 2005). Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes (Yau, 2018). Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories” (Walt, 1998). Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior\n2040011-8\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nof states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent (Buchanan, 2017, p. 22) and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 375). The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace (Bowcott, 2017). While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace (Lewis, 2015), the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]” (Kurowska, 2019, p. 9), it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities\nThe section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-9\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nis any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts (Yau, 2019a). In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage (Yau, 2019a), and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense (Slayton, 2017). While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain (Arquilla, 1996), winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence (Bartos, 2016). Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context (Lieber, 2014; Lindsay, 2013, 2015; Rid, 2013; Slayton, 2017).\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment (Lewis, 2015). Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the\n2040011-10\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsuccess of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons (Yau, 2019a). Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action (Lutz, 1983). Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-11\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure (Yau, 2019a).\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation\nWhile the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can\n2040011-12\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nonly be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through \"norms\" and \"entanglement\" is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both \"offence\" and \"defense\" were considered a means to an end. This has been termed \"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\" (Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the \"security dilemma.\" In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues, \"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\" (Libicki, 2016). For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of \"cyber offensive capabilities\" such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community (Yau, 2019a). So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-13\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states (Jervis, 1978). Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international\n2040011-14\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsecurity. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness (Hille, 2019), and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion\nCyberspace is a world of our making (Yau, 2018). Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of \"gray zone\" operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence (Libicki, 2009, p. 176), the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-15\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nfor cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime.",

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n*** In today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn. Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first\"fire and forget\"cyberweapon. Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as\"left of launch,\"to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated. Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of\"deterrence\"in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\"2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity, and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting\"cybersecurity as the national security\"(Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia By July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”.\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt... opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-3 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES # Deterrence Theories ## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace In the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action.\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists, and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust. In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured. Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire”.\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace Classic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia This is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression.\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers. Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors. The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,” September 2020 2040011-5 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\"active cyber defense,\"\"entanglement,\"and\"norms\"to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as\"hack back,\"is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include\"entanglement\"and\"norms\"as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the\"naming and shaming\"approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia When we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by\"defense,\"implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely\"cyber defense\"method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of\"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\"the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization, and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that:\"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and 2040011-6 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia control” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method. Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology. As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due September 2020 2040011-7 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES to the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction”. Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes. Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories”. Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior 2040011-8 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia of states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict”. The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace. While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]”, it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities The section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there September 2020 2040011-9 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES is any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts. In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage, and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense. While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain, winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence. Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context.\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment. Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the 2040011-10 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia success of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons. Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action. Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence September 2020 2040011-11 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure.\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation While the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can 2040011-12 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia only be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through\"norms\"and\"entanglement\"is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both\"offence\"and\"defense\"were considered a means to an end. This has been termed\"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\"(Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the\"security dilemma.\"In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues,\"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\". For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of\"cyber offensive capabilities\"such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community. So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being September 2020 2040011-13 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states. Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international 2040011-14 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia security. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness, and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion Cyberspace is a world of our making. Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of\"gray zone\"operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence, the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning September 2020 2040011-15 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES for cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime.",

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n*** In today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means. The general public's reliance on digital HON-MIN YAU (姚宏旻) is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate Institute of Strategic Studies (GISS), War College, National Defense University, Taiwan. His research interests focus on global security and national security policy. He can be reached at <cf22517855@gmail.com>.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-1</cf22517855@gmail.com> ISSUES &amp; STUDIES technology has created new security challenges for the survival of states, and cybersecurity has been considered by many countries as an essential issue impacting their national security.\nThe following well-known events further attest to this observation. In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn. Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first\"fire and forget\"cyberweapon. Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as\"left of launch,\"to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated. Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of\"deterrence\"in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\"2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity, and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting\"cybersecurity as the national security\"(Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia By July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”.\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt... opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-3 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES # Deterrence Theories ## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace In the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action.\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists, and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust. In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured. Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire”.",
    "# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia When we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.": "Traditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by\"defense,\"implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely\"cyber defense\"method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of\"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\"the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization, and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that:\"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and 2040011-6 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia control” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method. Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology. As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due September 2020 2040011-7 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES to the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction”. Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes. Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories”. Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior 2040011-8 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia of states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict”. The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace. While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]”, it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.",
    "# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities The section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there September 2020 2040011-9 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES is any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.": "First, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts. In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage, and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense. While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain, winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence. Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context.\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment. Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the 2040011-10 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia success of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons. Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action. Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence September 2020 2040011-11 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure.\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.",
    "# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation While the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?": "In many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can 2040011-12 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia only be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through\"norms\"and\"entanglement\"is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both\"offence\"and\"defense\"were considered a means to an end. This has been termed\"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\"(Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the\"security dilemma.\"In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues,\"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\". For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of\"cyber offensive capabilities\"such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community. So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being September 2020 2040011-13 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states. Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international 2040011-14 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia security. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness, and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.",
    "# Conclusion Cyberspace is a world of our making. Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of\"gray zone\"operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence, the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.": "To conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning September 2020 2040011-15 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES for cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime."

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n*** In today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means.

He can be reached at <cf22517855@gmail.com>.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-1</cf22517855@gmail.com> ISSUES &amp; STUDIES technology has created new security challenges for the survival of states, and cybersecurity has been considered by many countries as an essential issue impacting their national security.\nThe following well-known events further attest to this observation. In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn. Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first\"fire and forget\"cyberweapon. Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as\"left of launch,\"to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated. Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of\"deterrence\"in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\"2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity, and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting\"cybersecurity as the national security\"(Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia By July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”.\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt... opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-3 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES # Deterrence Theories ## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace In the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action.\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists, and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust. In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured. Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire”.\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace Classic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia This is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression.\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers. Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors. The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,” September 2020 2040011-5 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\"active cyber defense,\"\"entanglement,\"and\"norms\"to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as\"hack back,\"is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include\"entanglement\"and\"norms\"as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the\"naming and shaming\"approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia When we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by\"defense,\"implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely\"cyber defense\"method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of\"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\"the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization, and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that:\"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and 2040011-6 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia control” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method. Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology. As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due September 2020 2040011-7 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES to the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction”. Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes. Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories”. Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior 2040011-8 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia of states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict”. The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace. While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]”, it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities The section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there September 2020 2040011-9 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES is any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts. In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage, and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense. While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain, winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence. Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context.\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment. Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the 2040011-10 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia success of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons. Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action. Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence September 2020 2040011-11 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure.\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation While the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can 2040011-12 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia only be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through\"norms\"and\"entanglement\"is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both\"offence\"and\"defense\"were considered a means to an end. This has been termed\"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\"(Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the\"security dilemma.\"In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues,\"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\". For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of\"cyber offensive capabilities\"such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community. So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being September 2020 2040011-13 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states. Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international 2040011-14 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia security. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness, and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion Cyberspace is a world of our making. Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of\"gray zone\"operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence, the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning September 2020 2040011-15 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES for cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime.",

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n***\nIn today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn (Bright, 2007). Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first \"fire and forget\" cyberweapon (Milevski, 2011, p. 64). Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as \"left of launch,\" to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated (Stoddart, 2016, p. 833). Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of \"deterrence\" in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\" 2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity (Lin, 2018), and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting \"cybersecurity as the national security\" (Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nBy July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” (MND, 2019, p. 69) as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence” (MND, 2017, p. 38).\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt . . . opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-3\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n# Deterrence Theories\n## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace\nIn the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action (Geers, 2010; Jervis, Lebow, &amp; Stein, 1989).\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists (Libicki, 2009), and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter (Glaser, 2011)? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response (Yau, 2015) and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust (Jasper, 2015). In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured (Yau, 2019b). Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire” (Libicki, 2009).\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace\nClassic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nThis is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression (Mazarr, 2018; G. H. Snyder, 1959).\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers (Ghosh, 2016; Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors (Berghel, 2017). The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,”\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-5\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\"active cyber defense,\" \"entanglement,\" and \"norms\" to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as \"hack back,\" is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include \"entanglement\" and \"norms\" as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the \"naming and shaming\" approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia\nWhen we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by \"defense,\" implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely \"cyber defense\" method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\" the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization (MND, 2019, p. 40), and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that: \"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and\n2040011-6\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\ncontrol” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method (Morgan, 2003, pp. 15–20). Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology (Chee, 2019) and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology (Dai, 2019). As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-7\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nto the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction” (Lebow, 2005). Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes (Yau, 2018). Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories” (Walt, 1998). Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior\n2040011-8\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nof states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent (Buchanan, 2017, p. 22) and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 375). The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace (Bowcott, 2017). While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace (Lewis, 2015), the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]” (Kurowska, 2019, p. 9), it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities\nThe section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-9\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nis any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts (Yau, 2019a). In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage (Yau, 2019a), and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense (Slayton, 2017). While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain (Arquilla, 1996), winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence (Bartos, 2016). Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context (Lieber, 2014; Lindsay, 2013, 2015; Rid, 2013; Slayton, 2017).\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment (Lewis, 2015). Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the\n2040011-10\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsuccess of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons (Yau, 2019a). Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action (Lutz, 1983). Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-11\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure (Yau, 2019a).\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation\nWhile the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can\n2040011-12\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nonly be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through \"norms\" and \"entanglement\" is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both \"offence\" and \"defense\" were considered a means to an end. This has been termed \"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\" (Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the \"security dilemma.\" In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues, \"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\" (Libicki, 2016). For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of \"cyber offensive capabilities\" such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community (Yau, 2019a). So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-13\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states (Jervis, 1978). Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international\n2040011-14\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsecurity. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness (Hille, 2019), and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion\nCyberspace is a world of our making (Yau, 2018). Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of \"gray zone\" operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence (Libicki, 2009, p. 176), the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-15\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nfor cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime."

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n***\nIn today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means. The general public's reliance on digital\nHON-MIN YAU (姚宏旻) is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate Institute of Strategic Studies (GISS), War College, National Defense University, Taiwan.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn (Bright, 2007). Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first \"fire and forget\" cyberweapon (Milevski, 2011, p. 64). Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as \"left of launch,\" to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated (Stoddart, 2016, p. 833). Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of \"deterrence\" in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\" 2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity (Lin, 2018), and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting \"cybersecurity as the national security\" (Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nBy July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” (MND, 2019, p. 69) as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence” (MND, 2017, p. 38).\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt . . . opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-3\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n# Deterrence Theories\n## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace\nIn the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action (Geers, 2010; Jervis, Lebow, &amp; Stein, 1989).\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists (Libicki, 2009), and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter (Glaser, 2011)? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response (Yau, 2015) and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust (Jasper, 2015). In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured (Yau, 2019b). Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire” (Libicki, 2009).\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace\nClassic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nThis is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression (Mazarr, 2018; G. H. Snyder, 1959).\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers (Ghosh, 2016; Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors (Berghel, 2017). The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,”\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-5\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\"active cyber defense,\" \"entanglement,\" and \"norms\" to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as \"hack back,\" is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include \"entanglement\" and \"norms\" as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the \"naming and shaming\" approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia\nWhen we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by \"defense,\" implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely \"cyber defense\" method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\" the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization (MND, 2019, p. 40), and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that: \"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and\n2040011-6\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\ncontrol” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method (Morgan, 2003, pp. 15–20). Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology (Chee, 2019) and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology (Dai, 2019). As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-7\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nto the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction” (Lebow, 2005). Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes (Yau, 2018). Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories” (Walt, 1998). Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior\n2040011-8\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nof states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent (Buchanan, 2017, p. 22) and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 375). The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace (Bowcott, 2017). While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace (Lewis, 2015), the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]” (Kurowska, 2019, p. 9), it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities\nThe section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-9\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nis any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts (Yau, 2019a). In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage (Yau, 2019a), and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense (Slayton, 2017). While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain (Arquilla, 1996), winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence (Bartos, 2016). Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context (Lieber, 2014; Lindsay, 2013, 2015; Rid, 2013; Slayton, 2017).\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment (Lewis, 2015). Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the\n2040011-10\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsuccess of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons (Yau, 2019a). Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action (Lutz, 1983). Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-11\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure (Yau, 2019a).\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation\nWhile the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can\n2040011-12\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nonly be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through \"norms\" and \"entanglement\" is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both \"offence\" and \"defense\" were considered a means to an end. This has been termed \"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\" (Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the \"security dilemma.\" In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues, \"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\" (Libicki, 2016). For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of \"cyber offensive capabilities\" such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community (Yau, 2019a). So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-13\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\ncapable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states (Jervis, 1978). Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international\n2040011-14\nSeptember 2020\nEvolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\nsecurity. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness (Hille, 2019), and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion\nCyberspace is a world of our making (Yau, 2018). Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of \"gray zone\" operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence (Libicki, 2009, p. 176), the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning\nSeptember 2020\n2040011-15\nISSUES &amp; STUDIES\nfor cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime."

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n*** In today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn. Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first\"fire and forget\"cyberweapon. Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as\"left of launch,\"to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated. Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of\"deterrence\"in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\"2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity, and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting\"cybersecurity as the national security\"(Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia By July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”.\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt... opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-3 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES # Deterrence Theories ## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace In the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action.\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists, and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust. In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured. Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire”.\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace Classic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n2040011-4 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia This is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression.\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers. Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors. The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,” September 2020 2040011-5 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\"active cyber defense,\"\"entanglement,\"and\"norms\"to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as\"hack back,\"is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include\"entanglement\"and\"norms\"as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the\"naming and shaming\"approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia When we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by\"defense,\"implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely\"cyber defense\"method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of\"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\"the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization, and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that:\"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and 2040011-6 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia control” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method. Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology. As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due September 2020 2040011-7 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES to the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction”. Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes. Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories”. Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior 2040011-8 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia of states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict”. The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace. While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]”, it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities The section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there September 2020 2040011-9 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES is any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts. In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage, and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense. While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain, winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence. Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context.\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment. Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the 2040011-10 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia success of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons. Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action. Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence September 2020 2040011-11 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure.\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation While the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can 2040011-12 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia only be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through\"norms\"and\"entanglement\"is likely to succeed?\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both\"offence\"and\"defense\"were considered a means to an end. This has been termed\"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\"(Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the\"security dilemma.\"In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues,\"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\". For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of\"cyber offensive capabilities\"such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community. So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being September 2020 2040011-13 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES capable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states. Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international 2040011-14 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia security. Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness, and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n# Conclusion Cyberspace is a world of our making. Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of\"gray zone\"operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence, the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning September 2020 2040011-15 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES for cyber contingency, improve technical know-how on intrusion techniques, and build a positive reputation in the information industry. This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime."

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.\nKEYWORDS: Deterrence theory; security policy; kinetic cyberattacks; cybersecurity; international relations.\n*** In today's wired world, both public and private organizations are relying on cyberspace for everything from financial transactions to military movement. States and societies are increasingly dependent on information; businesses are quickly promoted, and ideas are freely shared. Cyberspace has become an intrinsic part of our daily activities. However, the water that bears a boat is the same that swallows it up. Traditional threats, namely nations and states, are now exploiting this non-traditional means. The general public's reliance on digital HON-MIN YAU (姚宏旻) is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate Institute of Strategic Studies (GISS), War College, National Defense University, Taiwan. His research interests focus on global security and national security policy. He can be reached at <cf22517855@gmail.com>.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-1</cf22517855@gmail.com> ISSUES &amp; STUDIES technology has created new security challenges for the survival of states, and cybersecurity has been considered by many countries as an essential issue impacting their national security.\nThe following well-known events further attest to this observation. In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn. Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first\"fire and forget\"cyberweapon. Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as\"left of launch,\"to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated. Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of\"deterrence\"in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\"2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity, and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting\"cybersecurity as the national security\"(Office of the President, 2018).\n2040011-2 September 2020 Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia By July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence”.\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt... opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\nSeptember 2020 2040011-3 ISSUES &amp; STUDIES # Deterrence Theories ## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace In the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action.\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists, and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust. In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured. Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire”.\n\n---\n\n## # An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation While the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\n\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles.

In 2007, Estonia became the victim of massive cyberattacks during a political dispute over relocating a Soviet-era Memorial Statue within the capital city, Tallinn (Bright, 2007). Later in 2008, Georgia suffered a barrage of cyberattacks during Russia's intervention during the independence movements of two autonomous Georgian regions (Korns &amp; Kastenberg, 2009). In 2010, a malicious computer worm, Stuxnet, disrupted Iranian nuclear development for a couple of years by creating kinetic destruction to centrifuges in its highly secured Natanz, a uranium enrichment facility (Farwell &amp; Rohozinski, 2011). The software was praised as the first \"fire and forget\" cyberweapon (Milevski, 2011, p. 64). Recently in 2017, it was reported by the New York Times that the US had conducted an anti-ballistic missile program via cyber means, known among policymakers as \"left of launch,\" to disable North Korea's nuclear ballistic ambition (Broad &amp; Sanger, 2017). As such sophisticated forms of cyber threats are prevalent, state-sponsored cyberattacks with the potential to deliver kinetic and physical destruction are considered an important issue in national defense policymaking. Hence, this paper plans to investigate how states can deal with these challenges in cybersecurity.\n\nAs the interest of states in leveraging evolving cyberwarfare techniques has grown significantly, various countries are devoting resources to making themselves cyber-sophisticated (Stoddart, 2016, p. 833). Policymakers are engaging in applying the concept of \"deterrence\" in cyberspace in keeping with this trend. In East Asia, this tendency toward security enhancement has caught the attention of Taiwan and Japan.\n\nUpon the inauguration of Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen administration in 2016, the government immediately established the Department of Cybersecurity in the Executive Yuan to step up Taiwan's cyber defense efforts (\"Cabinet Forms,\" 2016; Executive Yuan, 2016). In 2017, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Warfare Command to build offensive capabilities to counter China's cyberattacks (Huang &amp; Liu, 2017; Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], 2017). Taiwan also passed the Information and Communication Security Management Act in May 2018 to tighten up its public and private partnership in cybersecurity (Lin, 2018), and in September 2018, the National Security Council published its first National Cybersecurity Strategy Report promoting \"cybersecurity as the national security\" (Office of the President, 2018).\n\n2040011-2\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\nBy July 2019, the National Security Act had been modified to provide a legal mandate for government agencies, such as the military, to protect Taiwan’s cyberspace (Legislative Yuan, 2019). As was later pointed out by *The 2019 National Defense Report*, Taiwan plans to establish “credible cyber offense and defense capability” (MND, 2019, p. 69) as “the first layer of deterrent force” (Legislative Yuan, 2019, p. 211) to support the military strategy of “resolute defense, multi-domain deterrence” (MND, 2017, p. 38).\n\nAt the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has continuously called for better cyber capabilities throughout his administration. His and Japan’s first *National Security Strategy* (NSS) in 2013 identified cyber threats as a significant risk for the global commons (Prime Minister’s Office, 2013). His government passed *The Basic Act on Cybersecurity* in 2014 to create a mandate for the government to form a cybersecurity strategy. The latest *Cybersecurity Strategy* in 2018 highlighted the role of the Self-Defense Force (SDF) and designated an independent section to emphasize the need for “enhancing deterrence capabilities” against cyberattacks (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, 2018). In addition, the current *National Defense Program Guidelines* (NDPG) (Japanese Government, 2018b) and the *Medium Term Defense Program* (MDP) (Japanese Government, 2018a) have called for the need to deter any cyberattacks, emphasizing the necessity of strengthening the “capability to disrupt . . . opponents’ use of cyberspace for the attack” during conflicts against Japan. Japan’s sense of insecurity in cyberspace is a reaction to certain developments in geopolitical competition, including longstanding territorial disputes in the East China Sea, and it was reported by *The Japan Times* on December 21, 2018 that the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had urged China to take “responsible” actions against cyberattacks in association with Chinese state organs (“Japan Slams,” 2018).\n\nGiven that both Taiwan and Japan see themselves as under the threat of cyberattacks from China, it will be beneficial for this study to explore the strategic designs of both countries. However, the current literature provides little analysis of the use of a deterrence strategy in this East Asian security context. Furthermore, while policy documents from both Taiwan and Japan seem to suggest a plan for deterrence against cyberattacks, neither has offered specific statements or arguments regarding the utility of such a stance. As both countries are encountering common cyber threats from China, the overall aim of this paper is to assess the strategic value of a deterrence framework in cyberspace. Hence, this paper investigates the extent to which a deterrence strategy could deter malicious activities in the cyber domain and the possible implications within the East Asian context.\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-3",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\n# Deterrence Theories\n\n## Problems of Using Nuclear Deterrence Thinking in Cyberspace\n\nIn the discipline of International Relations (IR), deterrence is an old practice inherited from the Cold War. At that time, great powers threatened each other with nuclear force to manipulate the decision-making process of their adversaries. The use of a “threat” by one party could influence a rational actor’s cost and benefit calculations, and any rival could be psychologically convinced that unacceptable losses could outweigh any possible gains under a certain course of action (Geers, 2010; Jervis, Lebow, &amp; Stein, 1989).\n\nHowever, the past literature has questioned the effectiveness of deterrence as suggested by nuclear strategists (Libicki, 2009), and one of the most significant limitations in cyberspace is the problem of attribution. Attribution in cybersecurity refers to the ability to locate the identity of attackers. However, users in cyberspace very often enjoy the advantage of being anonymous. Since we do not know who are the malicious actors behind a cyberattack, whom should we deter (Glaser, 2011)? Besides, if the perpetrators of cyberattacks are a terrorist group instead of a “rational” state actor, the fundamental assumption for a classic (nuclear) deterrence strategy would be unsustainable since the logic of the attackers in terms of a cost–benefit calculation could be quite distinct from that of a state actor. Furthermore, when suffering cyberattacks, the scale of the damage is not immediately estimable. To what extent should a state respond in order to deliver a credible threat based on uncertainty (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015)? There are also complicated issues involving the legality of a cyber response (Yau, 2015) and the liability of potential spillover effects to other domains such as liberty, rights, and trust (Jasper, 2015). In addition, as cyber capabilities are hard to quantify and gauge, most of the literature talks about cyber power in the international system without explaining how it is measured (Yau, 2019b). Due to these various limitations and our inability to effectively deter attackers in cyberspace, Martin Libicki concludes in *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* by saying that “Cyberretaliation — with all its difficulties — should not be the only response in the repertoire” (Libicki, 2009).\n\n## New Deterrence Variants in Cyberspace\n\nClassic deterrence theorizing during the nuclear age places an excessive emphasis on credibly presenting the “means” of punishment, instead of thinking about how to achieve the “ends” of deterrence by altering an adversary’s perception.\n\n2040011-4\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\nThis is to say that if the essence of a deterrence strategy is to influence a rival’s mental calculations and psychological awareness, such an “end” could in fact be achieved by means other than a direct threat. As the theorizing of deterrence strategies focuses on affecting an adversary’s cost and benefit calculations, there are in general two approaches that can be used to achieve deterrent effects. One is “deterrence by punishment,” which means increasing the “costs” in an aggressor’s calculation formula, and the other one “deterrence by denial,” which intends to reduce the potential “benefits” of an act of aggression (Mazarr, 2018; G. H. Snyder, 1959).\n\nHowever, as explained in the previous sub-section, the conventional argument is that a deterrence strategy is less effective in the cyber domain as it is unable to locate the identity of the attackers. It thereby offers plausible deniability for malicious actors, which can fundamentally constrain the utility of the strategy. Nevertheless, the problem of attribution is now being considered a challenge rather than an impossibility due to advancements in technology (US DoD, 2015, pp. 11–12). For example, a conclusion in regard to attribution can be reached by investigating the code of the malware and software infrastructure used by attackers, as it may contain some tool marks that can help identify the attackers (Ghosh, 2016; Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015). Certain tactics, techniques, and procedures are also often repeatedly used by the same group of hostile actors (Berghel, 2017). The literature indicates that many hacking activities are publicly attributed to specific actors (Rid &amp; Buchanan, 2015; Yau, 2019a), and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in September 2018 stated in its official report, *A Guide to Cyber Attribution*: “Establishing attribution for cyber operations is difficult but not impossible” (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018). Undermining the advantage of plausible deniability in cyberspace has promoted the cottage industry of conceptual theorizing for deterrence in cyberspace. Hence, when thinking about the security context of cyberspace in this framework, five methods are currently referred to with frequency in the literature, and they are introduced below.\n\nThe first approach is “cyber defense.” As an approach to deterrence through denial, cyber defense intends to fortify one’s cyberspace. This method has been a standard practice for nations and states, whereby they make a malicious actor consider that the potential gains are not worth the resources and time invested. However, given the perception that this method is limited in its effectiveness, as exemplified by the prevalence of cyberattacks, many countries are looking into more aggressive approaches.\n\nThe international community is looking into the approach of deterrence by punishment. This approach comprises the other four methods, which are “cyber offence,”\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-5",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\n\"active cyber defense,\" \"entanglement,\" and \"norms\" to increase the cost of initiating cyberattacks. Cyber offence refers to using cyber means to punish malicious perpetrators. While cyber offence has the negative connotation of being considered an aggressive act and destabilizing to international peace (Hathaway, Crootof, Levitz, &amp; Nix, 2012), some studies have attempted to justify the practice by stating that active cyber defense, commonly known as \"hack back,\" is in line with the right to self-defense as specified in the United Nations (UN) charter (Rosenzweig, Bucci, &amp; Inserra, 2017). In addition to the three methods mentioned above which aim to shape an actor's perception of the costs behind cyberattacks, Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. proposes stretching cyber deterrence to include \"entanglement\" and \"norms\" as two alternative methods (Nye, Jr., 2017). Entanglement refers to an actor's awareness that while interconnectivity makes initiating a cyberattack relatively easy and cheap, the same characteristics can be exploited by an adversary. Deterrence by norms is similar to the \"naming and shaming\" approach in regard to the nuclear taboo, and it requires the international community's development of norms in cyberspace.\n\n# Empirical Challenges of Cyber Deterrence in East Asia\n\nWhen we examine these five methods in an East Asian context, we will discover that each of them is either insufficient or lacks certain capabilities when compared with current empirical developments.\n\nTraditionally, an argument for the failure of deterrence in cyberspace was based on the fact that low-cost readymade intrusion tools were widely available for non-state actors, but Joseph Samuel Nye, Jr. argues that deterrence by \"defense,\" implemented by a relatively resource-rich state, can deny non-state actors such low-skilled intrusions (Nye, Jr., 2017). Given that the starting point of this paper is to understand how Taiwan and Japan can deter China-sponsored malicious cyber activities, the effectiveness of a deterrence strategy against non-state actors would not be a point of contention within this paper. However, what we can take from this argument is that a purely \"cyber defense\" method is insufficient to deal with a sophisticated actor with high cyber skills, and China seems to fit into this profile in East Asia. Taiwan's 2019 National Defense Whitepaper states that under the guideline of \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW),\" the PLA continues to develop various platforms to attack networks and information within our essential organization (MND, 2019, p. 40), and the Japanese NDPG has also stated that: \"[China] is rapidly advancing capabilities in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent's command and\n\n2040011-6\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\ncontrol” (Japanese Government, 2018b, p. 5). Due to geopolitical reasons, both Taiwan and Japan appear to have identified China as a major cyber threat, and they feel the need to enhance their cyber postures.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that strategies of “cyber offence” will be useful because the success of this method depends on the opponent being persuaded by changing its perception of another actor’s cyber capabilities. Three crucial factors of capabilities, credibility, and communicating a threatening message to the challenger are required to ensure the success of this method (Morgan, 2003, pp. 15–20). Among them, credibility is the most important consideration. Thomas Schelling noted that: “... to persuade enemies or allies... It requires projecting intentions. It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave.” With regard to the subject of this paper, this relates to how Taiwan and Japan can demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities to creditably dissuade China from continuing its hostile cyber activities both in word and practice. While the wording of policy documents in both Taiwan and Japan is strong and unquestionable, it is more about how to demonstrate their offensive capabilities. But this scenario needs to be more than just an act of cyber vandalism in order to be credible; it is very likely that it should be a case of Stuxnet-level demonstration.\n\nThe other consideration of “cyber offence” is that such deterrence through the use of a punishment strategy needs to penetrate through China’s current cyber defense in order to be credible by demonstrating a use case within China’s Great Firewall. However, if both Taiwan and Japan demonstrate such intrusive cyber capabilities by delivering kinetic destruction either within or outside Chinese cyberspace, the effect could likely backfire and damage the information and communications technology (ICT) reputations of both countries as exemplified in the debate over the information security (Infosec) risks of Huawei’s 5G technology (Chee, 2019) and the international backlash against China’s surveillance equipment exports from companies like Hikvision and Dahua Technology (Dai, 2019). As a reputation of trust in the ICT industry is an essential prerequisite for business success, cyberwarfare capabilities can spill over to the economic domain. The development of offensive cyber capabilities will inevitability sacrifice the economic security of both countries.\n\nWith these concerns in mind, a strategy of “active cyber defense” or a second-strike capability seems to be less troublesome. However, “active cyber defense” is probably more of a doctrinal issue, as the credibility of cyber capabilities is still crucial. Such a strategy is similar to a “cyber offence” method, and Taiwan and Japan still need to demonstrate a credible capacity for the success of this “active cyber defense,” which ironically faces the same concerns as “cyber offence.” In addition, due\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-7",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\nto the high possibility of the disruption or destruction of civil networks during wartime, the success of a second strike capability in cyberspace implies the forward deployment of a Trojan horse or logic bomb on an adversary’s information systems during peacetime (Clarke &amp; Knake, 2011), which ironically presupposes an act of aggression that could potentially arouse political accusations and even create increased insecurity for the region. While Bernard Brodie argued that the purpose of deterrence is to shift the mission of military force from winning wars to preventing them, on the contrary, “active cyber defense” has the opposite potential of conflict escalation (Brodie, Dunn, Wolfers, Corbett, &amp; Fox, 1946).\n\nFurthermore, the conditions for adopting deterrence by “entanglement” are not sufficient yet in East Asia. When talking about nuclear deterrence, Richard Ned Lebow stated: “To the extent that deterrence worked, most of the credit should go to self-deterrence [emphasis added], reinforced by mutual recognition that a nuclear war could — indeed almost certainly would — result in mutual destruction” (Lebow, 2005). Hence, “entanglement” is often called “self-deterrence,” and it requires China’s self-awareness in recognizing that cyberattacks could be exploited by it and its adversaries and deliver destructive effects both within China and beyond. However, from the perspective of policy documents specified in Taiwan and Japan, they do not observe that China is concerned about cyber entanglement; otherwise, there would be no need for them to step up the cyber postures of both countries. It is very likely that Chinese telecom companies are all state-owned, and this environment allows China to have full control of network traffic via state-controlled critical communication nodes (Yau, 2018). Western countries rarely enjoy the same capabilities due to limited access to privately-owned infrastructures. Hence, China’s Great Firewall provides relatively better security for China’s cyberspace than other Western countries since such an on-path system can interfere with both inbound and outbound traffic directly through injection, redirection, and suppression. In other words, the “World Wide Web” in China is still the “China Wide Web.”\n\nIn addition, the effectiveness of deterrence by “norms” is still questionable and yet to be defined. Just like Stephan Walt’s argument in 1998 that there are many analytical perspectives on IR issues, attitudes toward appropriate conduct in cyberspace are also those of “one world, many theories” (Walt, 1998). Hence, proponents of a “tit for tat” strategy such as cyber deterrence using cyberattacks would argue that China will initiate cyberattacks on Taiwan and Japan regardless of what they do. They argue that safeguarding one’s digital territory should rely on the enhancing of one’s cyber capabilities instead of the goodwill of others. However, this line of thought ignores the possibility that international norms can sometimes constrain the behavior\n\n2040011-8\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\nof states. For example, the sovereignty of states used to be infrangible but is now redefined by international human rights laws, and whale hunting used to be legally justified as a state’s right to harvest natural resources but is now reinterpreted as an act of endangering natural species. People attribute this norm building to the successful contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and the International Whaling Commission. While these NGOs do not have the command of military aircraft, tanks, and other forms of material power at the disposal of states, they can nevertheless shape international norms and make states refrain from taking unilateral action.\n\nThe above argument would suggest that deterrence through “norms” would presuppose the universal acknowledgment of appropriate cyber conduct by members of the international community. The question then would be, what are the norms for the activities of states in cyberspace? Unfortunately, institutions and norms in cybersecurity are only nascent (Buchanan, 2017, p. 22) and there is a lack of agreement on the standardization of such “norms.” One commonly cited work is the Tallinn Manual, which specifies that, “cyber operations executed in the context of armed conflicts are subject to the law of armed conflict” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 375). The UN working group, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), only came to an initial understanding in 2015 that attacking critical infrastructure violated international laws such as the Law of Armed Conflict (UN General Assembly, 2015), but in 2017 it failed to agree on what constitutes a state’s right to self-defense in cyberspace (Bowcott, 2017). While the international community is struggling to define the criteria for “armed attack” and “the use of force” in cyberspace (Lewis, 2015), the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG), a new UN working group backed by Russia and China, was established in 2019 to offer an alternative forum for the shaping of cyber norms (UN General Assembly, 2019). As Russia has stated that “the practice of club agreements should be sent into the annals of history [in GGE]” (Kurowska, 2019, p. 9), it could be expected that the OEWG is destined to create tension with the interim cyber norms proposed by the GGE. Hence, this is not to deny the feasibility of deterrence through “norms,” but the prerequisites for this strategy have not yet been realized. Speaking empirically, more time is still required for nations and states to converge their apparent contending positions.\n\n# The Conceptual Problems of Offensive Cyber Capabilities\n\nThe section above indicates that the utility of a deterrence strategy against state-sponsored cyberattacks is weaker than what policymakers have thought. Before there\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-9",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\nis any apparent progress in deterrence through “entanglement” or “norms,” nations and states are expected to compensate for insufficiencies in their “cyber defense” with continuous investment into their cyberwarfare capabilities, such as “cyber offence” or “active cyber defense,” to reduce their sense of insecurity. Although they hope to use their offensive cyber capabilities to create a “deterrence by punishment” effect to dissuade their adversaries, there are more conceptual pitfalls that countries need to carefully consider.\n\nFirst, developing an offensive cyber capacity is not cheap. It requires expansive and sophisticated collaboration in terms of talent, time, and intelligence and has no guarantee of actual success in future conflicts (Yau, 2019a). In the case of Stuxnet, people often pay attention to how this malware can exploit unknown software vulnerabilities in order to deliver kinetic destruction as it did in an Iranian nuclear facility. However, as programmers may make mistakes, so do hackers. It is often ignored that to ensure that Stuxnet worked without any coding mistakes, the developer must have acquired expansive nuclear centrifuges to make sure that the malware would work in the same environment (Broad, Markoff, &amp; Sanger, 2011). Our tendency to use cyberwarfare to solve cybersecurity problems could be based on certain misconceptions of cyber weapons, and such a belief is reminiscent of the cult of the offensive during WWI and could have potentially tragic results (J. L. Snyder, 1984). The success of known cyber offensives is largely the result of poor management rather than a technologically determined advantage (Yau, 2019a), and empirical analyses have already indicated that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities could have cost much more in terms of the offence than the defense (Slayton, 2017). While conventional wisdom may believe that cyberspace is an “offence-dominated” domain (Arquilla, 1996), winner of the inaugural NPS Foundation/U.S. Naval Institute Essay Contest Christopher Bartos argues in his work that cyber defense has a distinct advantage over cyber offence (Bartos, 2016). Hence, scholars have begun to be more critical of such a taken-for-granted conception, and many recognize that an offence strategy is only valid in a particular context (Lieber, 2014; Lindsay, 2013, 2015; Rid, 2013; Slayton, 2017).\n\nSecond, there is an unpredictable political cost that comes with the use of offensive cyber capabilities. A cyber weapon does not work like a drone or a missile, where the commander can know when and to what extent a target can be destroyed. It is also difficult for the attacker to predict the extent of collateral damage as they do not know what kind of systems are connected to the target network or where this cyber weapon will go in the interconnected network environment (Lewis, 2015). Due to the lack of reconnaissance capabilities for a battle damage assessment on the network, the\n\n2040011-10\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\nsuccess of such cyber counterattacks is hardly measurable due to the problem of effect-based calculations on cyber weapons (Yau, 2019a). Hence, there is still doubt as to the effectiveness of offensive cyber capabilities in informing cyber defense.\n\nThird, deterrence using a punishment strategy will inherently be an operation of countervalue that is incompatible with the current understanding of international laws. In the conventional conception of deterrence, counterforce and countervalue targeting are the two different courses of military action (Lutz, 1983). Countervalue targeting means holding targets appreciated by adversaries hostage in order to ensure their good behavior, and these targets are likely to be civilian populations or cities. Counterforce targeting is against the sinew of state power, and its targets refer to military forces or command and control facilities. In the East Asian context, as China can harvest a massive amount of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, this creates a fundamental problem of target acquisition for Taiwan and Japan. It is questionable how Taiwan and Japan can conduct a counterforce strategy to pre-empt the unknown and anticipate the origin of future incoming cyberattacks from the People's Liberation Army's military information infrastructure which can be embedded in any Chinese public or private information facilities. It is also questionable how effective such a pre-emption would be even during a cyber conflict, as the attackers can constantly transfer from one IP address to another through the use of Zombie computers located anywhere in the world. This means that the only choice Taiwan and Japan have at their disposal is a countervalue operation, namely an attack on China's civil information infrastructure. However, this would imply attacking civilian targets in China, which is fundamentally against the enduring principles of military necessity along with distinction and proportionality in the Law of Armed Conflict. Such subtle differences are something that Taiwan and Japan need to think through carefully.\n\nFinally, the advocates of developing offensive cyber capabilities not only overrate the utility of deterrence through punishment, but also often ignore the adverse effects that will result from such thinking. In the past, both Taiwan and Japan enjoyed enormous successes in the ICT industry due to their positive branding and credible reputations in terms of the security standards of their products. However, developing a capacity for cyberwarfare implies weaponizing this leading edge in ICT and leveraging their enterprises for the purpose of national defense, which is very problematic and counterproductive in a trust-based global ICT market. They face a unique cyber dilemma in which a state must sacrifice its economic security in order to enhance its offensive cyber capabilities, delivering a tactical advantage in cyberspace while resulting in a strategic loss in the real domain. While increasing one's cyber offence\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-11",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\ncapabilities cannot create disincentives to prevent war, it is however very likely to make the state more insecure (Yau, 2019a).\n\nIn short, the current conceptual scaffolding of cyber deterrence seems to limit our imagination of war and peace within the traditional security framework of the Cold War. The argument here is not that we should be utopian and campaign for political infeasibility, but rather that deterrence thinking in cyberspace is not only limited but also limiting, and investing in cyberwarfare capabilities has a huge potential to move from preventing a war into creating one. Developing a strategy other than pure deterrence thinking may provide a possible way ahead.\n\n# An Alternative Strategy: From Cyber Deterrence to Cyber Cooperation\n\nWhile the above notion that the possession of offensive cyber capabilities can deliver a deterrent effect is much disputed, the unanswered question in this investigation is that other than a fortification strategy of deterrence by denial in peacetime, what more can states do?\n\nIn many aspects, cyberattacks are in fact similar to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks delivered through ballistic missiles. Since a ballistic missile can be airborne-launched, submarine-launched, or land-based-launched (by fixed or mobile sites), and it is very challenging for defenders to know without proper intelligence where a ballistic missile is coming from and going to and what kind of payload it carries. Depending on its trajectory, this kind of attack can be quick and stealthy, and the attack often gives defenders very little time to react. Likewise, a cyberattack can come from public or private facilities either within or outside China. It can travel through multiple countries to conceal its identity before finally reaching its targets. Hence, the defense of these time-sensitive threats requires a collaborated intelligence and a well-coordinated response by surveillance sensors along their attacking trajectories. The prerequisite of a decent defense is good situation awareness, and security decisions depend on good intelligence. As a result, a key condition for fostering anything closer to credible deterrence in any form is the ability to respond to malicious cyberattacks (Lété &amp; Pernik, 2017), and this ability to respond is based on a sufficient knowledge of malware signatures that includes what software vulnerabilities are used, where the malware was discovered before, what kind of platform this malware is targeting, and any potential known forensic evidence. Therefore, a purely national approach to cybersecurity is inadequate. Maximizing the available response time can\n\n2040011-12\n\nSeptember 2020",
    "Evolving Toward a Balanced Cyber Strategy in East Asia\n\nonly be achieved with a close social network of information sharing in the form of a knowledge nexus embodying many countries in social and technical consultation from the moment that attacks are discovered.\n\nHence, an alternative strategy for East Asia would be a collaborative one in which like-minded countries with similar values and common threats cooperate in their technological development with the advancement of Infosec products, and share cyber intelligence by issuing malware reports and offering fixes for software vulnerabilities that are discovered. For a cyberattack to be successful, malware needs to exploit software vulnerabilities before they are spotted by defenders. Because a perpetrator's malware can only profit when a victim country is not aware of these software defects, the sharing of collected software vulnerabilities among countries can reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit. These like-minded countries must also acknowledge when they cannot even agree among themselves and come up with arrangements for a positive cyber exchange; otherwise, how can they expect to have a progressive cyber world in which deterrence through \"norms\" and \"entanglement\" is likely to succeed?\n\nHowever, this seems to be easier said than done, and it brings up another valid question. While cyberspace in its current state is anarchic without a stable structure to sustain the possibility of cooperation, how can we be sure that no one is cheating in this information sharing alliance and secretly stockpiling and weaponizing computer vulnerabilities? During the Cold War, security was achieved through the insurance of military security, and weapons designed for the purposes of both \"offence\" and \"defense\" were considered a means to an end. This has been termed \"the symbolic ambiguity of weapons\" (Booth &amp; Wheeler, 2007). One state cannot make itself more secure without making another less so, and this problem is termed the \"security dilemma.\" In cyberspace, however, offence and defense can sometimes be separated to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretations of cyber countermeasures. As Libicki argues, \"most of what brings about cybersecurity cannot possibly make others less secure directly\" (Libicki, 2016). For example, research and development investment into technologies without implications of \"cyber offensive capabilities\" such as encryption, authentication, access control, and comprehensive procedures could, in theory, maintain one's cybersecurity to an acceptable extent. While the above technologies are already well understood by academics, industries, and states as clearly non-threatening and defensive measurements, implementing a strategy to invest in such technological development has little chance of being misinterpreted by the international community (Yau, 2019a). So far, the most controversial tool for cyberspace may be commercial penetration testing software, which is deemed by some as being\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-13",
    "ISSUES &amp; STUDIES\n\ncapable of both offensive and defensive purposes. However, we should not ignore the fact that such tools are typically developed based on openly available vulnerabilities that are arguably not as cyber-sophisticated as Stuxnet. Hence, once the differentiation between offence and defense happens, as Robert Jervis once argued, it can permit cooperation among states (Jervis, 1978). Any defense cooperation should not simply be the wishful thinking of states, and Jervis’s argument suggests that even when countries would like to cooperate, the symbolic ambiguity of weapons in a realist world could hinder such a possibility. Only when defense can be separated from offence will states be capable of understanding that their security partners will not defect or cheat in international cooperation.\n\nIn the future, one possible way forward is for like-minded countries to enhance and extend their cyber cooperation based on existing dialogs. Established in 1990, FIRST.org is the most well-known NGO on a global scale. It has been recognized as the senior, leading organization in coordinating international resources in computer security, and there are 330 organizations in 73 countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) was initiated by the Japanese Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) in 2002 to encourage international cooperation and support, and there are 28 organizations from 20 areas on a regional level that are collaborating today. As state-sponsored cyberattacks often come with implications of economic and political signaling, East Asia can continue to deepen the existing “technical only” structure of cyber cooperation to evolve toward a possible “cyber regime complex” (Nye, Jr., 2014) which could work to secure cyberspace through multiple collaborations among governments, the private sector, the technical community, and NGOs in the region.\n\nFurthermore, while the international community is concerned about China’s ICT products due to its negative cyber reputation and bad track record, it would be beneficial for regional actors like Taiwan and Japan to shift their focus from developing cyber weapons to developing cybersecurity standards. They can invest in future cybersecurity standards since both countries have accumulated a certain ICT reputation and capabilities. However, the cooperation between Taiwan and Japan would not be a kind of military alliance that involves collective defense, as the legal term seems to suggest in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the US and Japan. Instead, it would be cooperation involving the sharing of technological know-how and industrial-oriented development. While the current international structure limits Taiwan’s participation in inter-government organizations, collaboration in cybersecurity could be technical and cooperative. It could also circumvent the thorny issue of political recognition making Taiwan a meaningful contributor to international\n\n2040011-14\n\nSeptember 2020",

Regional actors like Taiwan and Japan should start to share threat intelligence, develop a technical response, and build common standards against common state-sponsored cyber threats. On November 4, 2019, the US and Taiwan held the first joint cyber exercises to identify their vulnerabilities and enhance their cyber readiness (Hille, 2019), and we are starting to see more joint cyber exercises, training, education, and technical exchanges in the region. Cybersecurity would be better as a competition of cyber talent and not an arms race of cyber arsenals among nations and states.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCyberspace is a world of our making (Yau, 2018). Sophisticated, tailored malware can now travel across widely interconnected global networks along with possible anonymity and the ability to inject pathologies into any nation. These capabilities can now threaten a wide range of vital elements of modern economic and social contracts that were not historically at risk. In addition, state-sponsored cyberattacks can often be disguised and become a form of \"gray zone\" operations without affording any legal obligations. Hence, states believe that an effective cyber defense cannot be just reactive and needs to include a proactive element. On the one hand, this does not mean that cyber offence is the solution, as the effectiveness of deterrence should not be exaggerated and the power dynamics in cyberspace are still understudied. On the other hand, although Libicki has pointed out that the best defense in cyberspace is usually a good cyber defense and not necessarily a good cyber offence (Libicki, 2009, p. 176), the involvement of resource-rich actors like China has been eroding the foundation of this argument. While neither argument is perfect and they both have their limitations, this paper argues that a more balanced policy needs to be considered. This is to say that both Taiwan and Japan need defensive cyber capabilities to enhance their defenses in peacetime and an offensive cyber capability to enhance their offensive in wartime. What they should both consider doing more now is establishing closer collaboration in cybersecurity. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and a state's countermeasures and policy shall depend on the threat posed by the actors they wish to confront.\n\nTo conclude, cyberspace is not an alternative to real life but part of it. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that cyberwar will simply be a war in cyberspace through cyber means. It will rather be a military conflict in physical domains involving techniques of cyberwarfare. As both Taiwan and Japan are rich in ICT resources, deepening their collaboration in both technical know-how and human resources could offer a better early warning of cyberattacks and further develop a better early warning\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n2040011-15",

This is to say that although states cannot effectively deter cyberattacks in peacetime due to the various limitations in cyberspace and may wish to prepare for the unthinkable in wartime regardless of the adverse side effects of their offensive capabilities, they nevertheless must collaborate on cybersecurity, as such cooperation benefits all in both peacetime and wartime.\n\n# References\n\nArquilla, J.
