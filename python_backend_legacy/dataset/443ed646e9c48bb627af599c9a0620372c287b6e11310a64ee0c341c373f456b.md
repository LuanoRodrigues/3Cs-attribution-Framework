And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 2\nfrom 2013 to 2019, $^{5}$ and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. $^{6}$\nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. $^{7}$ Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges\nCyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene. With roots in the early 90s, the Internet has only been a communication staple for around 25 years. $^{8}$ Being such a fundamental part of most people's daily lives, yet still, such a new technology, it is no wonder\n$^{5}$ Cynthia E.

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet.⁹ Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate.¹⁰ This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹¹ There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure.¹² This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be\n⁹ Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n¹⁰ Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\nnation.\"¹⁵ Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.¹⁶\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n¹⁵ International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n¹⁶ Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism after Stuxnet (Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: United States Army War College Press, June 2014), 2-3.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 6\nU.S. Code, Section 2656f(d), using three points: “politically driven intention; serious effects; and computer networks as the means” of the attack.¹⁷ However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012,¹⁸ the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.¹⁹ There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n¹⁷ Chen, 3.\n¹⁸ Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n¹⁹ Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 7\ndamage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program.²⁰ Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”²¹\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise.²² It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.”²³ NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n²⁰ Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n²¹ Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n²² “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n²³ “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 8\nfactory in Tasmania.”²⁴ The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment.²⁵ “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.”²⁶ The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n²⁴ Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁵ As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁶ Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 9\nactivities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.”²⁷ On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.”²⁸ The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity\nThe severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”²⁹ Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.”³⁰ However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”³¹ This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the\n²⁷ Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers,³³ would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.”³⁴ Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command.³⁵ Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.”³⁶ False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to\n³² Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n³³ “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n³⁴ Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n³⁵ Martin C. Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* (California: RAND Corporation, 2009), 16.\n³⁶ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 11\nestablish. So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere.³⁷ As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,”³⁸ is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”³⁹\n## Distinguishing By Intent\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state.⁴⁰ Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate\n³⁷ Neil C. Rowe and E. John Custy, “Deception in Cyber Attacks,” in Lech J. Janczewski and Andrew M. Colarik eds., *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism* (Pennsylvania: Information Science Reference, 2008), 91.\n³⁸ Martin Lee, *Cyber Threat Intelligence* (Canada: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2023), 155.\n³⁹ *Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty*, UN General Assembly Resolution 2132 (XX), (New York, December 21, 1965).\n⁴⁰ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 12\ndisruption or corruption by one state of a system of interest to another state.”⁴¹ If an operation has hostile intent and is meant to cause damage or disrupt the functioning of a computer system, network, or critical infrastructure, it would be distinguished as a cyber attack. Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary.⁴² While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n⁴¹ Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n⁴² Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 13\nof their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime.⁴³ The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace.⁴⁴ The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality.⁴⁵ While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.”⁴⁶ France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense.⁴⁷ Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct\n⁴³ Michael N. Schmitt, introduction to Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 4.\n⁴⁴ Michael N.

The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,”⁴⁹ causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world.⁵⁰ Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.”⁵¹ A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.”⁵² While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n⁴⁸ Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n⁴⁹ Scott J.

Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n53 Schmitt, 18.\n54 Diane Marie Amann, ed., “Jurisdictional, Preliminary, and Procedural Concerns,” *Benchbook on International Law II.A* (2014). https://www.asil.org/sites/default/files/benchbook/jurisdiction.pdf.\n55 Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 18.\n56 Alberto E.

Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were\n59 “Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in the Time of War,” United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, Part I Article 2 (August 12 1949). https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war#:~:text=in%20all%20circumstances.-,Article%202,recognized%20by%20one%20of%20them..\n60 Jens David Ohlin, et al. eds., Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 80-83.\n61 Oscar M Uhler and Henri Coursier (ed.), “Commentary on Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” (Geneva: International Committee of the Red Cross, 1958) 26.

However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel⁶⁵ for 17 states⁶⁶ did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down,⁶⁷ the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.⁶⁸\nSelf-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks.

Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack.⁷⁰ However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act.⁷¹ Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.”⁷² This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to\n⁶⁹ “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n⁷⁰ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n⁷¹ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n⁷² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 19\ndifferentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 20\nWhere once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n77 Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations*, 4.\n78 Theohary, “Use of Force in Cyberspace,” United Nations Norms.\n79 UN.

The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n80 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 11.\n81 Michael N.

Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 23\ninterpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n23\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 24",

And so are the risks that come with it.” - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life. With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone, and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010. The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 2\nfrom 2013 to 2019, $^{5}$ and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. $^{6}$\nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. $^{7}$ Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges\nCyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene.

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet. Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate. This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure. This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be\n Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\nnation.\" Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n Thomas M.

However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012, the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020. There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n Chen, 3.\n Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 7\ndamage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program. Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise. It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.” NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 8\nfactory in Tasmania.” The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment. “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.” The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 9\nactivities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.” On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.” The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity\nThe severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.” However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.” This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the\n Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers, would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.” Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command. Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.” False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n Martin C.

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere. As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,” is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”\n## Distinguishing By Intent\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state. Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate\n Neil C. Rowe and E.

Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary. While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 13\nof their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime. The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace. The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality. While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.” France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense. Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct\n Michael N.

While helpful in creating norms regarding state action within cyberspace, these doctrines are municipal and do not affect the conduct of states outside of those that publish them.\n# Challenges in Applying Existing International Laws to Cyber Conflicts\nThere are numerous challenges when trying to apply existing international law to instances of cyber operations. The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,” causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world. Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.” A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.” While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n Scott J.

Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 16\nrespond to cyber attacks adequately. Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n\nSmedes 17\ninvolved in cyber acts that amounted to armed hostilities through the means of cyber capabilities, “an armed conflict would exist.” The Tallinn Manual explains this in further detail, elaborating that any “operation that causes a fire to break out in a small military installation would suffice to initiate an international armed conflict.” The presence of physical damage is ample enough to qualify as an armed force and the difficulty in attributing a cyber act to a state or an individual acting on behalf of a state poses a problem in identifying a sole cyber dispute as an armed conflict. However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel for 17 states did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down, the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.\nSelf-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent\n Ohlin, 82.\n Michael N.

The use of force is outlawed except in the act of self-defense against an attack. Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack. However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act. Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.” This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to\n “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 19\ndifferentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 20\nWhere once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 21\nImplementing the Tallinn Manual into international law is necessary for the protection of state autonomy and individual rights within cyberspace. The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 22\n# Conclusion\n“Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82\nCyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 23\ninterpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 24",

And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence ¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 2 from 2013 to 2019, and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. \nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.",

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet.⁹ Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate.¹⁰ This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹¹ There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure.¹² This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be ⁹ Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n¹⁰ Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of\"targets\"in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^ Similar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are\"cases of declared war\"or\"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another ^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 5 nation.\"¹⁵ Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted: Cyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.¹⁶ While this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the ¹⁵ International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n¹⁶ Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism after Stuxnet (Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: United States Army War College Press, June 2014), 2-3.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 6 U.S. Code, Section 2656f(d), using three points: “politically driven intention; serious effects; and computer networks as the means” of the attack.¹⁷ However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.",
    "## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks Numerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012,¹⁸ the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.¹⁹ There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.": "One of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical ¹⁷ Chen, 3.\n¹⁸ Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n¹⁹ Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 7 damage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program.²⁰ Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”²¹ In June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise.²² It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.”²³ NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate ²⁰ Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n²¹ Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n²² “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n²³ “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 8 factory in Tasmania.”²⁴ The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment.²⁵ “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.”²⁶ The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.",

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere.³⁷ As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,”³⁸ is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”³⁹ ## Distinguishing By Intent Cyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state.⁴⁰ Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate ³⁷ Neil C. Rowe and E. John Custy, “Deception in Cyber Attacks,” in Lech J. Janczewski and Andrew M. Colarik eds., *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism* (Pennsylvania: Information Science Reference, 2008), 91.\n³⁸ Martin Lee, *Cyber Threat Intelligence* (Canada: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2023), 155.\n³⁹ *Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty*, UN General Assembly Resolution 2132 (XX), (New York, December 21, 1965).\n⁴⁰ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 12 disruption or corruption by one state of a system of interest to another state.”⁴¹ If an operation has hostile intent and is meant to cause damage or disrupt the functioning of a computer system, network, or critical infrastructure, it would be distinguished as a cyber attack. Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary.⁴² While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.",
    "## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations Most existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.": "Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument ⁴¹ Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n⁴² Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 13 of their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime.⁴³ The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace.⁴⁴ The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality.⁴⁵ While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.”⁴⁶ France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense.⁴⁷ Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct ⁴³ Michael N. Schmitt, introduction to Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 4.\n⁴⁴ Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n⁴⁵ “The Tallinn Manual,” Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, Accessed November 11, 2023. https://ccdcoe.org/research/tallinn-manual/.\n⁴⁶ Arindrajit Basu, “India’s International Cyber Operations: Tracing National Doctrine and Capabilities,” United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (2022). https://unidir.org/files/2022-12/UNIDIR_India_International_Cyber_Operations.pdf.\n⁴⁷ Michael Schmitt, “France’s Major Statement on International Law and Cyber: An Assessment,” Just Security, September 16, 2019. https://www.justsecurity.org/66194/frances-major-statement-on-international-law-and-cyber-an-assessment/.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Smedes 14 through them.⁴⁸ While helpful in creating norms regarding state action within cyberspace, these doctrines are municipal and do not affect the conduct of states outside of those that publish them.\n# Challenges in Applying Existing International Laws to Cyber Conflicts There are numerous challenges when trying to apply existing international law to instances of cyber operations. The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,”⁴⁹ causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world.⁵⁰ Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.”⁵¹ A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.”⁵² While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n⁴⁸ Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n⁴⁹ Scott J. Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace*, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 52.\n⁵⁰ Shackelford, 52-53.\n⁵¹ Stephen J. Lukasik, *Protecting the Global Information Commons*, Telecommunications Policy, vol. 24 (2000): 525.\n⁵² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 16-17.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 15 The principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nSmedes 16 respond to cyber attacks adequately. Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes 17 involved in cyber acts that amounted to armed hostilities through the means of cyber capabilities, “an armed conflict would exist.”⁶³ The Tallinn Manual explains this in further detail, elaborating that any “operation that causes a fire to break out in a small military installation would suffice to initiate an international armed conflict.”⁶⁴ The presence of physical damage is ample enough to qualify as an armed force and the difficulty in attributing a cyber act to a state or an individual acting on behalf of a state poses a problem in identifying a sole cyber dispute as an armed conflict. However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel⁶⁵ for 17 states⁶⁶ did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down,⁶⁷ the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.⁶⁸ Self-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent ⁶³ Ohlin, 82.\n⁶⁴ Michael N. Schmitt (ed.), “Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare,” (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 83.

Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack.⁷⁰ However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act.⁷¹ Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.”⁷² This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.",
    "## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation As cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.": "In order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to ⁶⁹ “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n⁷⁰ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n⁷¹ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n⁷² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 19 differentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks,\"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that\"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\"would constitute\"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that\"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context\"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 20 Where once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 21 Implementing the Tallinn Manual into international law is necessary for the protection of state autonomy and individual rights within cyberspace. The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 22 # Conclusion “Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82 Cyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 23 interpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Smedes 24"

And so are the risks that come with it.” - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life. With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone, and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010. The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 2\nfrom 2013 to 2019, $^{5}$ and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. $^{6}$\nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. $^{7}$ Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges\nCyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene. With roots in the early 90s, the Internet has only been a communication staple for around 25 years. $^{8}$ Being such a fundamental part of most people's daily lives, yet still, such a new technology, it is no wonder\n$^{5}$ Cynthia E.

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet. Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate. This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure. This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be\n Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\nnation.\" Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism after Stuxnet (Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: United States Army War College Press, June 2014), 2-3.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 6\nU.S. Code, Section 2656f(d), using three points: “politically driven intention; serious effects; and computer networks as the means” of the attack. However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012, the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020. There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n Chen, 3.\n Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 7\ndamage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program. Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise. It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.” NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 8\nfactory in Tasmania.” The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment. “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.” The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 9\nactivities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.” On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.” The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity\nThe severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.” However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.” This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the\n Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers, would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.” Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command. Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.” False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n Martin C.

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere. As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,” is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”\n## Distinguishing By Intent\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state. Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate\n Neil C. Rowe and E.

Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary. While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 13\nof their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime. The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace. The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality. While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.” France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense. Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct\n Michael N.

While helpful in creating norms regarding state action within cyberspace, these doctrines are municipal and do not affect the conduct of states outside of those that publish them.\n# Challenges in Applying Existing International Laws to Cyber Conflicts\nThere are numerous challenges when trying to apply existing international law to instances of cyber operations. The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,” causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world. Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.” A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.” While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n Scott J. Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace*, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 52.\n Shackelford, 52-53.\n Stephen J. Lukasik, *Protecting the Global Information Commons*, Telecommunications Policy, vol. 24 (2000): 525.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 16-17.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 15\nThe principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 16\nrespond to cyber attacks adequately. Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n\nSmedes 17\ninvolved in cyber acts that amounted to armed hostilities through the means of cyber capabilities, “an armed conflict would exist.” The Tallinn Manual explains this in further detail, elaborating that any “operation that causes a fire to break out in a small military installation would suffice to initiate an international armed conflict.” The presence of physical damage is ample enough to qualify as an armed force and the difficulty in attributing a cyber act to a state or an individual acting on behalf of a state poses a problem in identifying a sole cyber dispute as an armed conflict. However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel for 17 states did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down, the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.\nSelf-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent\n Ohlin, 82.\n Michael N.

The use of force is outlawed except in the act of self-defense against an attack. Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack. However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act. Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.” This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to\n “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 19\ndifferentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 20\nWhere once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 21\nImplementing the Tallinn Manual into international law is necessary for the protection of state autonomy and individual rights within cyberspace. The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 22\n# Conclusion\n“Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82\nCyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 23\ninterpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 24",

And so are the risks that come with it.” - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life. With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone, and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010. The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 2\nfrom 2013 to 2019, $^{5}$ and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. $^{6}$\nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. $^{7}$ Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges\nCyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene. With roots in the early 90s, the Internet has only been a communication staple for around 25 years. $^{8}$ Being such a fundamental part of most people's daily lives, yet still, such a new technology, it is no wonder\n$^{5}$ Cynthia E.

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet. Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate. This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure. This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be\n Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\nnation.\" Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism after Stuxnet (Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: United States Army War College Press, June 2014), 2-3.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 6\nU.S. Code, Section 2656f(d), using three points: “politically driven intention; serious effects; and computer networks as the means” of the attack. However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012, the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020. There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n Chen, 3.\n Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 7\ndamage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program. Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise. It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.” NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 8\nfactory in Tasmania.” The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment. “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.” The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 9\nactivities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.” On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.” The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity\nThe severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.” However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.” This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the\n Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers, would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.” Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command. Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.” False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to\n Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n Martin C.

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere. As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,” is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”\n## Distinguishing By Intent\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state. Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate\n Neil C. Rowe and E.

Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary. While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 13\nof their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime. The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace. The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality. While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.” France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense. Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct\n Michael N.

While helpful in creating norms regarding state action within cyberspace, these doctrines are municipal and do not affect the conduct of states outside of those that publish them.\n# Challenges in Applying Existing International Laws to Cyber Conflicts\nThere are numerous challenges when trying to apply existing international law to instances of cyber operations. The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,” causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world. Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.” A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.” While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n Scott J. Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace*, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 52.\n Shackelford, 52-53.\n Stephen J. Lukasik, *Protecting the Global Information Commons*, Telecommunications Policy, vol. 24 (2000): 525.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 16-17.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 15\nThe principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 16\nrespond to cyber attacks adequately. Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n\nSmedes 17\ninvolved in cyber acts that amounted to armed hostilities through the means of cyber capabilities, “an armed conflict would exist.” The Tallinn Manual explains this in further detail, elaborating that any “operation that causes a fire to break out in a small military installation would suffice to initiate an international armed conflict.” The presence of physical damage is ample enough to qualify as an armed force and the difficulty in attributing a cyber act to a state or an individual acting on behalf of a state poses a problem in identifying a sole cyber dispute as an armed conflict. However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel for 17 states did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down, the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.\nSelf-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent\n Ohlin, 82.\n Michael N.

The use of force is outlawed except in the act of self-defense against an attack. Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack. However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act. Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.” This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to\n “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 19\ndifferentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 20\nWhere once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 21\nImplementing the Tallinn Manual into international law is necessary for the protection of state autonomy and individual rights within cyberspace. The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 22\n# Conclusion\n“Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82\nCyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 23\ninterpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 24"

And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 2\nfrom 2013 to 2019, $^{5}$ and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. $^{6}$\nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. $^{7}$ Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges\nCyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene. With roots in the early 90s, the Internet has only been a communication staple for around 25 years. $^{8}$ Being such a fundamental part of most people's daily lives, yet still, such a new technology, it is no wonder\n$^{5}$ Cynthia E.

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet.⁹ Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate.¹⁰ This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹¹ There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure.¹² This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be\n⁹ Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n¹⁰ Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^^\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n^^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\nnation.\"¹⁵ Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.¹⁶\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n¹⁵ International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n¹⁶ Thomas M.

Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012,¹⁸ the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.¹⁹ There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n¹⁷ Chen, 3.\n¹⁸ Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n¹⁹ Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 7\ndamage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program.²⁰ Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”²¹\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise.²² It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.”²³ NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n²⁰ Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n²¹ Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n²² “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n²³ “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 8\nfactory in Tasmania.”²⁴ The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment.²⁵ “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.”²⁶ The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n²⁴ Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁵ As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁶ Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 9\nactivities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.”²⁷ On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.”²⁸ The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity\nThe severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”²⁹ Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.”³⁰ However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”³¹ This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the\n²⁷ Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers,³³ would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.”³⁴ Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command.³⁵ Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.”³⁶ False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to\n³² Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n³³ “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n³⁴ Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n³⁵ Martin C.

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere.³⁷ As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,”³⁸ is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”³⁹\n## Distinguishing By Intent\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state.⁴⁰ Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate\n³⁷ Neil C. Rowe and E. John Custy, “Deception in Cyber Attacks,” in Lech J. Janczewski and Andrew M. Colarik eds., *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism* (Pennsylvania: Information Science Reference, 2008), 91.\n³⁸ Martin Lee, *Cyber Threat Intelligence* (Canada: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2023), 155.\n³⁹ *Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty*, UN General Assembly Resolution 2132 (XX), (New York, December 21, 1965).\n⁴⁰ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 12\ndisruption or corruption by one state of a system of interest to another state.”⁴¹ If an operation has hostile intent and is meant to cause damage or disrupt the functioning of a computer system, network, or critical infrastructure, it would be distinguished as a cyber attack. Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary.⁴² While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n⁴¹ Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n⁴² Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 13\nof their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime.⁴³ The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace.⁴⁴ The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality.⁴⁵ While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.”⁴⁶ France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense.⁴⁷ Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct\n⁴³ Michael N.

The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,”⁴⁹ causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world.⁵⁰ Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.”⁵¹ A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.”⁵² While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n⁴⁸ Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n⁴⁹ Scott J. Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace*, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 52.\n⁵⁰ Shackelford, 52-53.\n⁵¹ Stephen J. Lukasik, *Protecting the Global Information Commons*, Telecommunications Policy, vol. 24 (2000): 525.\n⁵² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 16-17.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 15\nThe principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n53 Schmitt, 18.\n54 Diane Marie Amann, ed., “Jurisdictional, Preliminary, and Procedural Concerns,” *Benchbook on International Law II.A* (2014). https://www.asil.org/sites/default/files/benchbook/jurisdiction.pdf.\n55 Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 18.\n56 Alberto E.

Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were\n59 “Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in the Time of War,” United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, Part I Article 2 (August 12 1949). https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war#:~:text=in%20all%20circumstances.-,Article%202,recognized%20by%20one%20of%20them..\n60 Jens David Ohlin, et al. eds., Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 80-83.\n61 Oscar M Uhler and Henri Coursier (ed.), “Commentary on Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” (Geneva: International Committee of the Red Cross, 1958) 26.

However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel⁶⁵ for 17 states⁶⁶ did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down,⁶⁷ the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.⁶⁸\nSelf-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent\n⁶³ Ohlin, 82.\n⁶⁴ Michael N.

Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack.⁷⁰ However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act.⁷¹ Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.”⁷² This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to\n⁶⁹ “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations* (June 1945): Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n⁷⁰ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n⁷¹ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n⁷² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 19\ndifferentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 20\nWhere once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n77 Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations*, 4.\n78 Theohary, “Use of Force in Cyberspace,” United Nations Norms.\n79 UN.

The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n80 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 11.\n81 Michael N. Schmitt, introduction to Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2017). Quoted in Eric Talbot Jensen, “The Tallinn Manual 2.0 Highlights and Insights,” Georgetown Journal of International Law, Vol. 48 (2017): 738.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 22\n# Conclusion\n“Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82\nCyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7\nSmedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 23\ninterpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n23\nGlobal Tides, Vol. 19 , Art. 7\nSmedes 24"

And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence ¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 2 from 2013 to 2019, and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. \nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n## Definitional Challenges Cyberspace is a new and ever-evolving arena in the international scene. With roots in the early 90s, the Internet has only been a communication staple for around 25 years. Being such a fundamental part of most people's daily lives, yet still, such a new technology, it is no wonder Cynthia E. Ayers, *Rethinking Sovereignty in the Context of Cyberspace*, (Carlisle Barracks Pennsylvania: U.S. Army War College, 2016), 1. https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo153133/csl.armywarcollege.edu/usacsl/Publications/Rethinking%20sovereignty.pdf.\n “Annual Threat Assessment of The U.S. Intelligence Community,” *Office of the Director of National Intelligence*, February 6, 2023.\n “A Short History of the Internet,” Science and Media Museum, December 3, 2020, https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/short-history-internet#:~:text=By%201995%20the%20internet%20and,around%2010%20million%20global%20users.\n “A Short History of the Internet.”\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 3 that it is hard for states and organizations to keep pace and implement safety guidelines. Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet.⁹ Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate.¹⁰ This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹¹ There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure.¹² This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense. These categories would better be ⁹ Sarah J. Lohman et al., *What Ukraine Taught NATO About Hybrid Warfare* (Carlisle Barracks, PA: US Army War College Press, 2022).\n¹⁰ Thomas M.

Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of\"targets\"in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^ Similar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are\"cases of declared war\"or\"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another ^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 7.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 5 nation.\"¹⁵ Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted: Cyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.¹⁶ While this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the ¹⁵ International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n¹⁶ Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism after Stuxnet (Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania: United States Army War College Press, June 2014), 2-3.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 6 U.S. Code, Section 2656f(d), using three points: “politically driven intention; serious effects; and computer networks as the means” of the attack.¹⁷ However, it is generally quite difficult to provide one concise definition for cyberterrorism, as there are an endless number of complex situations that can be imagined regarding attacks carried out through cyberspace. Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks Numerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012,¹⁸ the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.¹⁹ There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical ¹⁷ Chen, 3.\n¹⁸ Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n¹⁹ Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 7 damage to computers and the environment with which it interacted, rather than just wiping or stealing data off of the computers that it infected. With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program.²⁰ Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”²¹ In June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise.²² It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.”²³ NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate ²⁰ Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n²¹ Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n²² “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n²³ “Petya Ransomware.”\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 8 factory in Tasmania.”²⁴ The worm hit hundreds of companies around the world, causing millions of dollars in damages to each. The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment.²⁵ “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.”²⁶ The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks Differentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 ²⁴ Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁵ As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n²⁶ Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\nSmedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 9 activities done with criminal intent in cyberspace or which are computer-related.”²⁷ On the other hand, a cyber attack is defined more through the identity of the victim and attacker and the intent to “cause disruption or damage.”²⁸ The two can be differentiated through factors such as severity, attribution, and intent.\n## Differentiating By Severity The severity of a cyber operation can be analyzed through its impact on the physical world. The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”²⁹ Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.”³⁰ However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”³¹ This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force. For example, the NotPetya attack, the ransomware worm that crippled the Ukrainian infrastructure and caused billions of dollars in damages to companies around the ²⁷ Sylvia Kierkegaard, “EU Tackles Cybercrime,” in *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism*, ed.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers,³³ would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n## Attribution Challenges As the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.”³⁴ Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts. Unless there is a physical aspect to the attack or the deletion of information, it is very challenging to determine if an attack occurred at all. Additionally, attackers can place a code or virus in a system that can lie dormant for years, only to be activated by some future event or command.³⁵ Attackers can utilize numerous measures to conceal their origins, including “compromis[ing] other computers to use as intermediaries, or channel[ing] through anonymizing proxies that hide their Internet protocol address.”³⁶ False information is prevalent in cyberspace, and “identity is hard to ³² Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”\n³³ “South Staffordshire PLC/South Staffs Water/Cambridge Water Data Breach Claim,” *Leigh Day*, 2023. https://www.leighday.co.uk/our-services/group-claims/south-staffordshire-plcsouth-staffs-watercambridge-water-data-breach-claim/#:~:text=View%20profile-,FAQs,to%20its%20corporate%20IT%20network.\n³⁴ Fabio Cristiano, et al. eds., *Artificial Intelligence and International Conflict in Cyberspace* (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) 19-20.\n³⁵ Martin C. Libicki, *Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar* (California: RAND Corporation, 2009), 16.\n³⁶ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 11 establish. So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere.³⁷ As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,”³⁸ is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”³⁹ ## Distinguishing By Intent Cyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent. Intent is often understood as what is meant by an action or understanding if a group is acting on their agenda or working on behalf of a state.⁴⁰ Intent is necessary to determine if a cyber act should be constituted as a cybercrime or a cyber attack. Cyber attacks have been defined as the “deliberate ³⁷ Neil C. Rowe and E. John Custy, “Deception in Cyber Attacks,” in Lech J. Janczewski and Andrew M. Colarik eds., *Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism* (Pennsylvania: Information Science Reference, 2008), 91.\n³⁸ Martin Lee, *Cyber Threat Intelligence* (Canada: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 2023), 155.\n³⁹ *Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty*, UN General Assembly Resolution 2132 (XX), (New York, December 21, 1965).\n⁴⁰ Chen, *Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet*, 4.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 12 disruption or corruption by one state of a system of interest to another state.”⁴¹ If an operation has hostile intent and is meant to cause damage or disrupt the functioning of a computer system, network, or critical infrastructure, it would be distinguished as a cyber attack. Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary.⁴² While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations Most existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument ⁴¹ Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n⁴² Libicki, 75-90.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 13 of their national policy.” The Tallinn Manual solely covers cyber activities above the “use of force” and does not cover instances like cybercrime.⁴³ The Manual applies common conceptions of international law to cyberspace, including sovereignty, jurisdiction, and legal responsibility. While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace.⁴⁴ The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality.⁴⁵ While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.”⁴⁶ France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense.⁴⁷ Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications. NATO recently published its Allied Joint Publication 3.20, outlining its policies for cyber operations and Allied conduct ⁴³ Michael N. Schmitt, introduction to Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 4.\n⁴⁴ Michael N. Schmitt ed., Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn: Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n⁴⁵ “The Tallinn Manual,” Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, Accessed November 11, 2023. https://ccdcoe.org/research/tallinn-manual/.\n⁴⁶ Arindrajit Basu, “India’s International Cyber Operations: Tracing National Doctrine and Capabilities,” United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (2022). https://unidir.org/files/2022-12/UNIDIR_India_International_Cyber_Operations.pdf.\n⁴⁷ Michael Schmitt, “France’s Major Statement on International Law and Cyber: An Assessment,” Just Security, September 16, 2019. https://www.justsecurity.org/66194/frances-major-statement-on-international-law-and-cyber-an-assessment/.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Smedes 14 through them.⁴⁸ While helpful in creating norms regarding state action within cyberspace, these doctrines are municipal and do not affect the conduct of states outside of those that publish them.\n# Challenges in Applying Existing International Laws to Cyber Conflicts There are numerous challenges when trying to apply existing international law to instances of cyber operations. The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,”⁴⁹ causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world.⁵⁰ Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.”⁵¹ A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.”⁵² While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n⁴⁸ Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n⁴⁹ Scott J. Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace*, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 52.\n⁵⁰ Shackelford, 52-53.\n⁵¹ Stephen J. Lukasik, *Protecting the Global Information Commons*, Telecommunications Policy, vol. 24 (2000): 525.\n⁵² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 16-17.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 15 The principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace. A lack of definite known territory within cyberspace can lead some states to not have the ability to\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024\n\nSmedes 16 respond to cyber attacks adequately. Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict. It is difficult to see whether or not a solely cyber conflict could “constitute an international armed conflict.”62 If two states were https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes 17 involved in cyber acts that amounted to armed hostilities through the means of cyber capabilities, “an armed conflict would exist.”⁶³ The Tallinn Manual explains this in further detail, elaborating that any “operation that causes a fire to break out in a small military installation would suffice to initiate an international armed conflict.”⁶⁴ The presence of physical damage is ample enough to qualify as an armed force and the difficulty in attributing a cyber act to a state or an individual acting on behalf of a state poses a problem in identifying a sole cyber dispute as an armed conflict. However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel⁶⁵ for 17 states⁶⁶ did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects. While there was no direct physical damage to the pipeline, and it is still unknown if there would have been had the pipeline not been shut down,⁶⁷ the attack caused widespread chaos and prompted the United States to enact numerous cybersecurity reforms.⁶⁸ Self-defense and retaliation are challenging to comprehend when faced with cyber attacks. Article 2 of the UN Charter bans the use or threat of force; however, it allows for self-defense in Article 51, stating that “nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent ⁶³ Ohlin, 82.\n⁶⁴ Michael N.

Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack.⁷⁰ However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act.⁷¹ Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.”⁷² This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation As cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat. To adequately protect against and counter the growing threat of cyber attacks, legal definitions need to be introduced, sovereignty should be defined, and the Tallinn Manual needs to be implemented into international agreements.\nIn order to achieve international understanding and cooperation, concise legal definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare are necessary. As it stands, there is little to ⁶⁹ “Charter of the United Nations,” *United Nations*: Article 2, 51. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text.\n⁷⁰ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 63-66.\n⁷¹ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 65-66.\n⁷² Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare*, 66.\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 19 differentiate cyber crimes from cyber attacks in the eyes of international law. This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks,\"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that\"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\"would constitute\"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that\"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context\"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation. The Law of Armed Conflict must be applied to any presence of the use of force within cyber attacks for the protection of international human rights.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 20 Where once the Internet was solely managed by a handful of researchers, today, thousands of entities, “including companies, organizations, and governments – have a stake in regulating cyberspace.”77 This divided control of cyberspace creates issues in governance and regulation, especially when implementing new treaties and legislation. Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 21 Implementing the Tallinn Manual into international law is necessary for the protection of state autonomy and individual rights within cyberspace. The Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on cyber operations and cyber warfare within the context of international law. As it stands currently, the Manual is merely a recommendation for state practice and holds no authority in the international community; serving as “an expression of solely the opinions of the International Group of Experts, all acting in their own capacity.”80 Implementing the Manual into international legislation would be a much-needed advancement in cybersecurity and protection against cyber attacks. The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare. The authors of the Manual have examined the foundational principles of international law and adapted them to conform to the cyber arena. By no means will the adoption of the Manual create a perfect world in regards to cyberspace; nevertheless, it will help to apply existing international laws and norms to cyberspace. Implementing the Manual through conventions will benefit the international community immensely. While not complete or perfect by any means, the Manual is widely referenced and looked to for guidance on the topic of international law applicable to cyber warfare.\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 22 # Conclusion “Cyberspace is both essential to the existence of governments and those governed, and dangerous in its relative anonymity and connectivity to virtually all corners of the world.”82 Cyber operations are one of the latest challenges that have arisen in the new age of technology. Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 23 interpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Smedes 24"

And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence ¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7 Smedes 2 from 2013 to 2019, and continues to place the threat of cyber attacks as one of the most pressing global risks. \nThe Internet has been in existence for 40 years; however, it has only yet become a staple of daily life within the last two decades. Because of this, the threat that attackers can pose through means of cyber operations is a new and original concept to the international community. For this reason, there are very few definitions for cyber operations, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, and the distinction between cybercrime and cyber attacks, none of which are universally accepted. This lack of definitions and the novelty of cyberspace generate confusion regarding the place of cyber operations within international law and the application of preceding laws. The majority of pre-existing international laws are difficult to apply to cyber operations. It is necessary that international law evolves with the changing climate of the world's threats and adapts existing legislation and norms to apply to cyberspace and cyber operations. Failing to do so will leave states unable to respond to the growing threat that the lack of regulations on cyberspace poses to the international community.\n\n---\n\n## ## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation As cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat.

By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention. The Tallinn Manual’s https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globalides/vol19/iss1/7 Smedes: International Cyber Law Smedes 23 interpretation of international law regarding cyber operations and cyber warfare should be enacted internationally. These definitions, regulations, and advice set up a solid foundation for understanding and effectively regulating international cyber operations. Along with these regulations, an agreement for international collaboration and information sharing can help to reduce cyberspace’s anonymity and promote a unified international front against cyber operations. Through the implementation of these definitions and regulations, States will be able to adequately respond and investigate cyber operations and hopefully enforce the proposed regulations from the Tallinn Manual.\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024 Smedes 24",

And so are the risks that come with it.”¹ - Former U.S. President Barack Obama\n\nSince its introduction in the early 1980s, the Internet has evolved and integrated itself into nearly every aspect of daily life.² With an estimated 60-80% of the world carrying a computer in their pocket in the form of a mobile smartphone,³ and even more having daily access to the Internet, an endless wealth of information and assistance is now quite literally at one’s fingertips. However, this emerging digital realm does come with many dangers. With digital technology advancing rapidly, municipal and international management and regulations have struggled to keep pace, causing cyber threats to pose a significant risk to nations and individuals alike. In the last fifteen years, the use of cyber as a means to facilitate operations within warfare has become an issue of international risk. The United Kingdom has presented “cyber attack, including those by other States, and by organised crime and terrorists” as one of the four ‘Tier One’ threats to national security since 2010.⁴ The UK is not alone in seeing cyber attacks as a major threat. The United States has listed cyber attacks as the number one global threat in its Worldwide Threat Assessments conveyed to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence\n\n¹ Barack Obama, “Text: Obama’s Remarks on Cyber-Security,” *New York Times*, May 29, 2009. https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29obama.text.html.\n² “A Brief History of the Internet,” University System of Georgia, accessed November 21, 2023. https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml.\n³ Laura Silver, “Smartphone Ownership is Growing Rapidly Around the World, but Not always Equally,” *Pew Research Center*, February 5, 2019. https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/smartphone-ownership-is-growing-rapidly-around-the-world-but-not-always-equally/.\n⁴ “Integrated Review Refresh 2023: Responding to a more contested and volatile world,” *GOV.UK*, updated May 16, 2023, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world/integrated-review-refresh-2023-responding-to-a-more-contested-and-volatile-world.\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024",

Currently, nearly all developed nations have most of their critical infrastructure linked to and in some cases controlled by digital technologies or the Internet.⁹ Areas such as power grids, healthcare systems, air traffic, transportation, and financial institutions all rely heavily on digital technologies and access to the Internet to operate.¹⁰ This shared reliance on such new technology can be an enormous weakness and an easy opening for attacks.\n\nCyberspace is a broad realm and can include endless situations and topics. The National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. Department of Commerce gives a general definition of cyberspace as a “global domain…consisting of the interdependent network of information systems… including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”¹¹ There are many different terms within the world of cyberspace and concerning its potential vulnerability; however, there are few universally acknowledged definitions and classifications. Cyberwar is a phrase that has been center stage in media and science fiction for the past decade or so. An early study split cyberwarfare into five categories: (1) web vandalism, (2) disinformation campaigns, (3) gathering secret data, (4) disruption in the field, and (5) attacks on critical national infrastructure.¹² This definition of cyberwar produces confusion surrounding the subject since it does not use war as a legal conception, but rather in a rhetorical and descriptive sense.

    "Global Tides, Vol. 19 [2024], Art. 7\nSmedes 4\n\ndescribed as cyber operations. Cyber Operations are a broad concept within the realm of cyberspace and can cover quite an extensive list of scenarios.\n\nCyber operations can be broadly described as operations against or via a computer or a computer system through a data stream. Such operations can aim to do different things, for instance to infiltrate a system and collect, export, destroy, change, or encrypt data or to trigger, alter or otherwise manipulate processes controlled by the infiltrated computer system. By these means, a variety of \"targets\" in the real world can be destroyed, altered or disrupted, such as industries, infrastructures, telecommunications, or financial systems. The potential effects of such operations are therefore of serious humanitarian concern.^[13]^\n\nSimilar to cyber operations, cyber attacks fit within the context of a cyber operation but refer to an operation against a particular object or entity.^[14]^ Cyber attack is usually used to refer to a singular event, however, it can be episodic. Cyberwar, conversely, implies a constant state of war with the direct attack of one or more nations on another. The attribution of attacks within cyberspace is notoriously difficult to determine without the expressed claim of action from the attacking state. Cyberwar, in a legal definition, would require the wartime Law of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, which is set forth primarily by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, providing protective parameters to limit the effects of armed conflicts and set regulations on state practice during times of conflict. However, the only guidelines that the Geneva Conventions give regarding what constitutes armed conflict are \"cases of declared war\" or \"where a nation is partially or totally occupied by soldiers of another\n\n^[13]^ International Committee of the Red Cross, “International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Report 311C/11/5.1.2, (October 2011) 36.\n^[14]^ Michael N.

    "Smedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 5\n\nnation.\"¹⁵ Due to the limited application of international law to the cyber arena, cyberwar, in this sense, is better described as a series of cyber attacks.\n\nThe requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict and attribution of an attack to the attacking state are difficult to attain in scenarios of cyber operations where there is no direct armed conflict. Instead, it is often easier to label cyber operations or attacks as cyberterrorism rather than cyberwar if there is no state to which the attack is attributed. Professor Dorothy Denning provides a definition of cyberterrorism to the House Armed Services Committee in May of 2000 that is generally accepted:\n\nCyberterrorism is the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace. It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives. Further, to qualify as cyberterrorism, an attack should result in violence against persons or property, or at least cause enough harm to generate fear. Attacks that lead to death or bodily injury, explosions, plane crashes, water contamination, or severe economic loss would be examples. Serious attacks against critical infrastructures could be acts of cyberterrorism, depending on their impact. Attacks that disrupt nonessential services or that are mainly a costly nuisance would not.¹⁶\n\nWhile this definition helps determine what could constitute cyberterrorism, it is now 23 years old and has not seen many advancements and changes that the digital age has brought. For example, Denning does not take into account that cyber attacks are notoriously difficult to attribute to a state or actor without direct admission of fault from them. Additionally, it does little to distinguish from a cyber attack or to differentiate between a cyber attack and cybercrime. The U.S. Department of State gives a more concise definition of terrorism through Title 22 of the\n\n¹⁵ International Committee of the Red Cross, Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols, (Washington D.C.: American Red Cross, April 2011). https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/atg/PDF_s/International_Services/International_Humanitarian_Law/IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf.\n¹⁶ Thomas M.

Because of this, the majority of scenarios discussed in this paper will be referred to as cyber operations or cyber attacks.\n\n## Evolution and Historical Examples of Cyber Attacks\n\nNumerous examples of cyber operations and attacks have occurred in the public eye in recent years. Several high-profile events have come into the international spotlight in the last decade and a half – including cyber operations during the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, the Stuxnet virus, the Shamoon virus that attacked Saudi Aramco in 2012,¹⁸ the Sandworm espionage campaign in 2014, the NotPetya attack in 2017, and the SolarWinds attack in 2020.¹⁹ There are likely hundreds more, and many are speculated to have never been discovered.\n\nOne of the first verified examples of a cyber attack with real physical damage was against Iranian nuclear plants in 2010. Inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency visiting one of the uranium enrichment plants noticed that the centrifuges were failing at an alarming rate. Eventually, several bad files were discovered on a series of computers in Iran; this discovery became the world’s first digital weapon. This weapon was later named Stuxnet. What made Stuxnet different from any other computer virus was its ability to cause real physical\n\n¹⁷ Chen, 3.\n¹⁸ Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern, and Claire Finkelstein, *Cyberwar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 76-101.\n¹⁹ Michael Hill, “10 industry-defining security incidents from the last decade,” *CSO*, July 16, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/573203/10-industry-defining-security-incidents-from-the-last-decade.html\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7",

With a focus on destroying centrifuges within Iran to halt the enrichment of uranium, it is clear that Stuxnet’s purpose was to “derail, or at least delay, the Iranian” nuclear program.²⁰ Due to alleged last-minute coding modifications, Stuxnet was discovered early after its introduction and did not cause as much harm and wreckage as it had the potential to. At the very least, it is estimated to have set back the Iranian nuclear program by two years. While it is now widely accepted that Stuxnet was developed by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, neither nation has come forward and taken ownership of the attack. Stuxnet serves as one of the first examples of how dangerous emerging cyberspace can be. It is significant as it represents the “first widely recognized intrusion of computer code into the world of international conflict.”²¹\n\nIn June of 2017, the malware now known as NotPetya was discovered, using Ukrainian tax accounting software as a backdoor and disguise.²² It quickly spread and “infected organizations in several sectors, including finance, transportation, energy, commercial facilities, and healthcare.”²³ NotPetya was a ransomware worm that infected computer systems and, within seconds, would encrypt its records and files, asking for a ransom paid in Bitcoin to retrieve the computer’s files. However, if paid, the files had already been overwritten and were lost forever. While its original target was to attack machines and infrastructure in Ukraine, within hours it had infected “countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate\n\n²⁰ Kim Zetter, *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon* (New York: Crown Publishers, 2014) p. 1-10.\n²¹ Josh Fruhlinger, “Stuxnet explained: The first known cyberweapon,” *CSO*, August 31, 2022. https://www.csoonline.com/article/562691/stuxnet-explained-the-first-known-cyberweapon.html.\n²² “Petya Ransomware,” Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, last revised February 15, 2018. https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/07/01/petya-ransomware.\n²³ “Petya Ransomware.”\n\nPublished by Pepperdine Digital Commons, 2024",

The final loss from the attack totaled an estimated $10 billion, according to a White House assessment.²⁵ “It would hit at least four hospitals in Kyiv alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs, and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency.”²⁶ The attack crippled the infrastructure of Ukraine as well as numerous companies around the world. It has since been largely attributed to the Russian military. NotPetya now stands as an example of the potential danger cyber attacks can pose to the global system. Even though Ukraine was the primary target of the NotPetya attack, hundreds of other companies worldwide experienced the attack or its effects.\n\nAs the Internet advances and progresses, it continues to be integrated into various aspects of life; from media to education to utilities, the average person interacts with cyberspace multiple times per day. In most states, digital adaptation has progressed to the level where their critical infrastructure relies on electronic and online activity to operate. This interconnectedness and reliance on cyberspace can pose quite a risk for a cyber operation or attack.\n\n## Differentiating Cyber Crimes and Cyber Attacks\n\nDifferentiating cyber operations between cybercrime and cyberattacks can be quite difficult. To distinguish between them, it is necessary to look back at their definitions. A simple definition of cybercrime would generally be “any illegal act involving a computer and all\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7\n\n²⁴ Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n\n²⁵ As stated in Andy Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History,” Wired, August 22, 2018. https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/.\n\n²⁶ Greenberg, “The Untold Story of NotPetya, the most Devastating Cyberattack in History.”",

The Tallinn Manual differentiates the two through the use of force, defining cyber criminality as any “cyber activities that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”²⁹ Typically, the Law of Armed Conflict is looked at to determine what constitutes a use of force. In this context, the notion of “force” in this context normally applies to physical armed force. Unfortunately, the “LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of use of force.”³⁰ However, in recent years, there has been a general consensus that “a cyber attack that causes or is reasonably likely to cause physical damage to property, loss of life or injury to persons would fall under the prohibition [of the use of force] in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”³¹ This means that any cyber attack that caused physical damage or injury could be categorized as a use of force.

On the other hand, South Staffordshire Water plc’s data breach last year; which leaked the private information, including name, address, and bank details, of an estimated 250,000 customers,³³ would not constitute a “use of force” as there was no physical element to the attack nor any physical damage attributed to it.\n\n## Attribution Challenges\n\nAs the cybersphere progresses and the norms of the digital world adapt and progress with the aid of advancements such as artificial intelligence, “international conflict becomes quintessentially unknowable.” A divide is created, and it becomes difficult to determine “where a conflict takes place, how it is recognized by computation, and who should take certain actions.”³⁴ Because cyber attacks occur in cyberspace, they are not like traditional conflicts.

So mimicry is easy and often effective” within this sphere.³⁷ As there is no face-to-face interaction in cyberspace, encryption can play a monumental role in hiding an attacker’s identity.\n\nAttribution, “the art and science of linking a cyber incident to a specific threat actor,”³⁸ is notoriously challenging to achieve in cyberspace and relies on the victim's ability to uncover their attacker's identity. For example, it is essential to note that while it is widely theorized that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, neither nation has come forward and claimed ownership of the attack. Attributing a cyber operation to a specific state, group, or individual is necessary to determine if it should be classified as a cybercrime or cyber attack and ensure that the perpetrator can be held accountable under municipal law, international law, or both.\n\nAttribution is also vital to ascertain where an attack came from. For example, if a cyber attack on a nation is attributed to another state or a group acting on behalf of another state, then this would violate the sovereignty of the victim nation and go against paragraph 1 of UN resolution 2131 (XX) which states that “no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any State.”³⁹\n\n## Distinguishing By Intent\n\nCyber attacks and cyber crimes can often be distinguished by their intent.

Additionally, if an operation has political intent, it would be classified as a cyber attack. However, if a cyber operation's sole intent is monetary gain or personal benefit, it would most likely not constitute a cyber attack and instead be a cyber crime. Having a clear understanding of the intent of a cyber attack can help determine the applicable legal framework and help decide if retaliation is necessary.⁴² While most likely not every cyber operation will have known attribution and intent, a combination of what is known and the damage left behind, if any, can help to classify a cyber operation as a cybercrime or cyber attack. If an operation causes physical damage or injury, it constitutes a cyber attack. In addition, if the operation can be attributed to a state, a group operating on behalf of a state, or a political group, it also comprises a cyber attack.\n\n## Examination of Existing International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\n\nMost existing international law is difficult to apply to the realm of cyberspace. Cyber operations lack many of the qualities that would categorize them under acts of war or terrorism, since the digital world is so new to the international landscape, and most instances of cyber operations lack a physical element of attack.\n\nPrepared by the International Group of Experts at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual is the most comprehensive guide for cyber operations and cyberwar. It examines existing international laws governing cyberwarfare and encompasses “the international law governing the resort of force by States as an instrument\n\n⁴¹ Libicki, Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, 23.\n⁴² Libicki, 75-90.\n\nhttps://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol19/iss1/7",

While not legally binding, it helps to provide a guide for states to follow regarding cyber operations and how to theoretically apply existing international law to cyberspace.⁴⁴ The Manual has a second edition that covers cyber incidents that most states encounter on a “day to day basis, but which fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed conflict,” or cyber criminality.⁴⁵ While helpful in providing definitions and guidelines for cyber operations, without being legally binding, the Tallinn Manual is merely a descriptor and provides a set of recommendations.\n\nMany nations have set forth doctrines to guide cyber operations performed by the state. For example, the US has set forth a Joint Publication guiding Cyber Operations of any branch of the United States military. India has implemented a Defence Cyber Agency into its Ministry of Defence to “control and coordinate the Joint Cyber operations.”⁴⁶ France has also released Droit International Appliqué aux Opérations dans le Cyberspace (International Law Applicable to Operations in Cyberspace), providing regulations for cyber operations, highlighting issues of sovereignty, intervention, due diligence, use of force, and self-defense.⁴⁷ Other international organizations, like the EU and NATO, have put forth publications.

The principle of sovereignty is a foundational premise for legislation within international law. This issue arises out of the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine sovereignty within cyberspace. It is not as simple as a nation's territory. Instead, cyberspace is an overarching space where “no one person or entity controls cyberspace,”⁴⁹ causing it to be a complex and dynamic sphere. Sovereignty and jurisdiction can apply to the Internet’s physical structure, but not to the flow of information that constitutes cyberspace.\n\nThis lack of a central authority or the ability to be under one nation’s control makes it difficult to apply much international legislation in the cyber world.⁵⁰ Cyberspace “couples the idea of communication and control with space, a domain previously unknown and unoccupied, where ‘territory’ can be claimed, controlled, and exploited.”⁵¹ A state has the right to “control cyber infrastructure and cyber activities within its territory.” The principle of sovereignty also allows a state to “inter alia, restrict or protect access to the Internet, without prejudice to applicable international law.”⁵² While not directly, sovereignty can apply to cyberspace in a legal sense and gives states the right to freedom from interference with said sovereignty through the means of cyber operations directed by another state.\n\n⁴⁸ Zoltán Gulyás ed., *Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations* (NATO Standardization Office, January 2020).\n\n⁴⁹ Scott J.

    "Smedes: International Cyber Law\nSmedes 15\n\nThe principle of jurisdiction is also quite difficult to apply to digital world scenarios. Jurisdiction in an international legal sense “encompasses the authority to prescribe, enforce, and adjudicate.”53 In the context of cyber operations, jurisdiction is used to attribute the authorization to prescribe legislation over the cyber arena, enforce said legislation, and act as a judge in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. The fundamental basis for a state to exercise jurisdiction is territoriality, or the physical or legal presence of an individual, object, or “conduct taking place within the country’s territory.”54 As all actions and reactions in cyberspace occur remotely, the challenge of where a cyber attack occurred can create confusion regarding who has jurisdiction. The Tallinn Manual argues to grant states the right to have jurisdiction over: “persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory,” “cyber infrastructure located on its territory,” and in cases of “extraterritoriality, in accordance with international law.”55 However, what was once considered the territory of a state has expanded and evolved into “a multidimensional area…that goes…beyond the…limits of the state.”56 Changes in territorial limits brought about through the Convention on the Law of the Sea57 and Convention on International Civil Aviation,58 among others, altered the notion of what is perceived as the territory of a nation. While the historical conception of a state’s territory has changed and morphed over time to align with contemporary needs, there is still little to determine if and how a state can have territory within cyberspace.

Similarly, attackers may see that there is little that a state can do to respond to an attack, prompting more attacks in the future. The lack of a solidly defined territory within cyberspace can cause jurisdiction regarding cyber operations, in general, to be unknown.\n\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict, also known as International Humanitarian Law, set forth by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and other sources, establish a set of provisions and regulations on the treatment of persons in times of armed conflict. Article 2 of the Conventions states that “the present conventions shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.”59 The Conventions use the term armed conflict to specifically avoid the reliance on the term “war,” as one party to a conflict could deny the existence of a state of war and forego the application of the Law of Armed Conflict.60 However, there is still little explanation as to what extent a situation could constitute an armed conflict. Commentary on the Conventions explains that “[a]ny difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.”61 This means that any discord between two states would implement Article 2 and the Law of Armed Conflict.

However, other situations can still exist where an attack causes no physical damage. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May of 2021, where a ransomware worm attacked the computers of the Colonial Pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, which led to the company shutting down the pipeline for six days which led to shortages of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel⁶⁵ for 17 states⁶⁶ did not have any lasting physical damage from the attack yet still had adverse effects.

Generally, this applies equally to cyber attacks as it does to physical attacks. The Tallinn Manual agrees with the exception of self-defense but adds that anticipatory self-defense should be provided for in the instance of an imminent cyber attack.⁷⁰ However, to ensure that a state does not abuse this provision, the Manual implements the requirement of imminence of attack and the requirement of immediacy to act.⁷¹ Self-defense is difficult to justify in some situations as “the fact that a cyber armed attack has occurred or is occurring may not be apparent for some time;” whether from the inability to identify the cause of damage “or that the initiator of the attack is not identified until well after the attack.”⁷² This is shown in the case of Stuxnet, where the cause of the damage and the initiator were not identified until long after the attack, making any response an act of retaliation rather than an act of self-defense.\n\n## Proposals for Strengthening Regulation\n\nAs cyberterrorism and the appearance of new cyber operations have and will continue to become more prevalent over the coming years, international law must adapt and move to counter this threat.

This lack of distinction can cause states not to act when prompted to, and create confusion over the severity of cyber operations. A proposed definition of cyber attacks should include potential physical damage or injury, attribution to a state or political group, and political intent. Whereas, any cyber operation that does not cause physical damage, is attributed to an individual or non-state related actor, and is executed with personal intent (being that for profit or personal agenda), would fall under the category of cybercrime. Cyber warfare should be described as cyber operations during times of war or the ongoing practice of engaging in cyber attacks against another state or entity.\n\nAdditionally, there needs to be an international agreement on what constitutes a use of force within cyberspace. The U.N. Charter's explanation of the use of force may apply in some circumstances to cyber attacks, \"but without specific agreement on its applicability, its relevance remains unclear.\"73 Several nations, including the United States, have incorporated doctrines that suggest that any cyber attack that \"produce[s] kinetic effects that might replicate fire power under other circumstances\" would constitute \"the use of force.\"74 Beyond the physical effects of cyber attacks, international law should reflect the position of the Tallinn Manual, that \"armed conflict exists wherever there are hostilities.\"75 Hostilities in this context \"exist whenever one State engages in 'cyber attacks' against another.\"76 In this sense, the use of force concerning armed conflict should include any instance of cyber attack, regardless of the physical damage caused to another nation.

Unlike a state's physical territory, there is no explicit sovereignty defined in cyberspace, further confusing the concept of jurisdiction regarding cyber operations. While most state governments play a role in regulating the Internet in their country, it is difficult even to determine the boundary of their nation within cyberspace.. However, there have been some recent advancements in the recognition of sovereignty within cyberspace such as the U.N. group of government experts' consensus on 11 norms regarding the use of cyberspace in 2015, including the notions that “nations should not intentionally damage each other’s critical infrastructure with cyber attacks [and they] should not target each other’s cyber emergency responders.”78 Although this covers non-intervention and the physical effects of cyber operations, it does not touch on the realm of cyberspace itself. Being that cyberspace itself is managed by thousands of different organizations and entities, a better approach would be to organize cooperation and information sharing on an international level. The U.N. Group of Governmental Experts “called upon the international community to work together in providing assistance to improve the security of critical…infrastructure; develop technical skills and appropriate legislation, strategies and regulatory frameworks…and bridge the divide in…security.”79 True international cooperation can help to combat the borderlessness of cyber threats and bring accountability to those engaging in cyber attacks.\n\n77 Shackelford, *Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations*, 4.\n78 Theohary, “Use of Force in Cyberspace,” United Nations Norms.\n79 UN.

The Manual does not create new laws, but rather “is meant to be a reflection of the law as it existed at the point of the Manual’s adoption.”81 This means that the Manual does not attempt to create new legislation regarding the operation of states within cyberspace; instead, it states existing laws and norms as they are and explains how they apply to cyber operations and cyber warfare.

Along with the emergence of these cyber attacks and cyber crimes, our existing international legislation struggles to keep up. It is necessary to produce internationally agreed-upon definitions of numerous terms within cyberspace. Cyber Operations were defined as individual actions within cyberspace or over electronics meant to cause harm and were purposefully sent from another party, whether for personal or political motives. However, through this definition, an issue arises of how to differentiate between cyber attacks and cyber crime. Cyber crime and cyber attacks need to be differentiated as each action falls under a different jurisdiction and requires the enforcement of different laws and regulations. By, looking at previous historical cyber operations and existing international legislation, we found that cybercrimes can be differentiated from cyber attacks through severity, attribution, and intent. Through distinguishing and defining these terms, it becomes possible to create and enforce potential regulations for cyber operations using international law. Independent scholars have seen the need to apply international law to cyber operations and cyber warfare. Because of this, little new legislation needs to be created, and rather, existing theories need to be implemented and enforced at an international level. The use of force, from the 1947 Geneva Conventions, in regards to cyber operations should apply in any case that there are hostilities, as this would enact the Law of Armed Conflict, allowing for international intervention.
