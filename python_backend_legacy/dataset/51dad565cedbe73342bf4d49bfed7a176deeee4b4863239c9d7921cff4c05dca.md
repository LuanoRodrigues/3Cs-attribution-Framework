Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.\n# 1. Introduction\nIn 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that \"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\" (Syeed, 2017, para.3). Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as \"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\" (Schmitt, 2017, p. 564). The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739\nReceived 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024\nAvailable online 23 March 2024\n0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare (Bilal, 2021). Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states (CCDCOE, 2023) confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear (Corn & Taylor, 2017). Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space (Bergamasco et al. 2020). There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures\nThis section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures\nSpace infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few (Manulis et al. 2021). Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure\nMost, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services (Georgescu et al. 2018). For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient\ncommunication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021). As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021).\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures\nMultiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (Tatar et al. 2020; Vollmer, 2021). Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage (Amenabar, 2022; Harrison et al. 2022). Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit (Georgescu et al. 2018). As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations (Keles, 2023).\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats (Housen-Couriel, 2023). This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface (Falco et al. 2023). There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom (Falco et al. 2023). Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data” (Bingen et al. 2023, p. 4). 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems (Bingen et al. 2023). This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n##\nThe first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe (Burgess, 2022). Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police (Burgess, 2022). Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts (Lemos, 2023). In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure\nPresently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale (Bergamasco et al. 2020). Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty\nA foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory” (Jennings & Watts, 1992, p. 564). Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states (Schmitt, 2017, pp. 11-12).\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 12), it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some\nexamples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world” (UNODA, 2023a, para. 6). In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention\nThe obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state (Moynihan, 2019). Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something (Roscini, 2014).\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test\nThe third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 331). Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense (Irmakkesen, 2014).”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches\nThe question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of\nof critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security (Roscini, 2014). In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force\nAttribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 96), and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities (Roscini, 2014), it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold (Schmitt, 2017, p. 97) as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused (Bergamasco et al. 2020).\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law\nSpace law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of\nspace law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made (UNOOSA, 1967).\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space (Schmitt, 2017). The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 271), while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space (Schmitt, 2017). Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space (UNODA, 2022). Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare (UNODA, 2023b). Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States (ICRC, 2022; U.S. Mission Geneva, 2023).\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” (Olejnik, 2023, para. 8)\nRegardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure\nBuilding on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty\nState A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis\nIn the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a\nrelevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations (Deeks, 2015). That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention\nIt was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis\nThe operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor,\nthe nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force\nState A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis\nA cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n##\nB.

Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\". The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739 Received 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024 Available online 23 March 2024 0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare. Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear. Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space. There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures This section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures Space infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few. Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure Most, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services. For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient communication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap. As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access.\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures Multiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage. Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit. As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations.\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats. This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites. For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface. There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom. Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments. Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data”. 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems. This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n## The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police. Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts. In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure Presently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale. Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty A foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory”. Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states.\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives”, it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some examples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world”. In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention The obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state. Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something.\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test The third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such”. Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense.”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches The question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of of critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security. In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force Attribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state”, and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities, it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused.\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law Space law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of space law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made.\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space. The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof”, while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space. Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space. Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare. Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States.\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” Regardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure Building on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty State A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis In the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a relevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations. That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention It was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis The operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor, the nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force State A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis A cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion Based on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n## B.

      "# 1. Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\".

      "## The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216)."

      "## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure Presently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale. Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios."

      "## Conclusion Based on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow."

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.",
    "# 1. Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\". The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739 Received 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024 Available online 23 March 2024 0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.": "e armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare. Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear. Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space. There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.",
    "## Background: Space infrastructures This section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.": "### Components of space infrastructures Space infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few. Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure Most, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services. For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient communication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap. As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access.\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures Multiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage. Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit. As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations.\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats. This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites. For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface. There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom. Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments. Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data”. 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems. This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.",
    "## The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).": "A few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police. Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts. In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.",
    "## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure Presently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale. Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.": "### General Principle of sovereignty A foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory”. Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states.\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives”, it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some examples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world”. In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention The obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state. Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something.\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test The third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such”. Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense.”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches The question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of of critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security. In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force Attribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state”, and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities, it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused.\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law Space law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of space law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made.\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space. The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof”, while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space. Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space. Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare. Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States.\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” Regardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.",
    "## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure Building on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.": "### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty State A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis In the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a relevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations. That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention It was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis The operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor, the nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force State A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis A cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.",
    "## Conclusion Based on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.": "Nevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.",

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.\n# 1. Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\". The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739 Received 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024 Available online 23 March 2024 0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare. Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear. Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space. There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures This section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures Space infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few. Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure Most, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services. For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient communication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap. As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access.\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures Multiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage. Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit. As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations.\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats. This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites. For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface. There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom. Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments. Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data”. 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems. This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n## The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police. Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts. In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure Presently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale. Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty A foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory”. Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states.\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives”, it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some examples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world”. In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention The obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state. Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something.\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test The third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such”. Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense.”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches The question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of of critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security. In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force Attribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state”, and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities, it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused.\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law Space law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of space law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made.\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space. The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof”, while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space. Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space. Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare. Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States.\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” Regardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure Building on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty State A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis In the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a relevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations. That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention It was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis The operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor, the nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force State A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis A cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion Based on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n## B.

Introduction\nIn 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that \"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\" (Syeed, 2017, para.3). Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as \"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\" (Schmitt, 2017, p. 564). The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739\nReceived 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024\nAvailable online 23 March 2024\n0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare (Bilal, 2021). Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states (CCDCOE, 2023) confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear (Corn & Taylor, 2017). Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space (Bergamasco et al. 2020). There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures\nThis section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures\nSpace infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few (Manulis et al. 2021). Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure\nMost, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services (Georgescu et al. 2018). For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient\ncommunication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021). As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021).\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures\nMultiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (Tatar et al. 2020; Vollmer, 2021). Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage (Amenabar, 2022; Harrison et al. 2022). Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit (Georgescu et al. 2018). As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations (Keles, 2023).\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats (Housen-Couriel, 2023). This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface (Falco et al. 2023). There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom (Falco et al. 2023). Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data” (Bingen et al. 2023, p. 4). 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems (Bingen et al. 2023). This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n##\nThe first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe (Burgess, 2022). Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police (Burgess, 2022). Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts (Lemos, 2023). In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure\nPresently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale (Bergamasco et al. 2020). Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty\nA foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory” (Jennings & Watts, 1992, p. 564). Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states (Schmitt, 2017, pp. 11-12).\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 12), it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some\nexamples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world” (UNODA, 2023a, para. 6). In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention\nThe obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state (Moynihan, 2019). Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something (Roscini, 2014).\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test\nThe third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 331). Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense (Irmakkesen, 2014).”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches\nThe question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of\nof critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security (Roscini, 2014). In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force\nAttribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 96), and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities (Roscini, 2014), it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold (Schmitt, 2017, p. 97) as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused (Bergamasco et al. 2020).\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law\nSpace law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of\nspace law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made (UNOOSA, 1967).\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space (Schmitt, 2017). The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 271), while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space (Schmitt, 2017). Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space (UNODA, 2022). Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare (UNODA, 2023b). Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States (ICRC, 2022; U.S. Mission Geneva, 2023).\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” (Olejnik, 2023, para. 8)\nRegardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure\nBuilding on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty\nState A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis\nIn the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a\nrelevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations (Deeks, 2015). That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention\nIt was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis\nThe operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor,\nthe nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force\nState A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis\nA cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n##\nB.

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.\n# 1. Introduction\nIn 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that \"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\" (Syeed, 2017, para.3). Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as \"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\" (Schmitt, 2017, p. 564). The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739\nReceived 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024\nAvailable online 23 March 2024\n0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare (Bilal, 2021). Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states (CCDCOE, 2023) confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear (Corn & Taylor, 2017). Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space (Bergamasco et al. 2020). There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures\nThis section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures\nSpace infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few (Manulis et al. 2021). Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure\nMost, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services (Georgescu et al. 2018). For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient\ncommunication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021). As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021).\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures\nMultiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (Tatar et al. 2020; Vollmer, 2021). Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage (Amenabar, 2022; Harrison et al. 2022). Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit (Georgescu et al. 2018). As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations (Keles, 2023).\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats (Housen-Couriel, 2023). This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface (Falco et al. 2023). There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom (Falco et al. 2023). Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data” (Bingen et al. 2023, p. 4). 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems (Bingen et al. 2023). This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n##\nThe first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe (Burgess, 2022). Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police (Burgess, 2022). Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts (Lemos, 2023). In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure\nPresently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale (Bergamasco et al. 2020). Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty\nA foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory” (Jennings & Watts, 1992, p. 564). Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states (Schmitt, 2017, pp. 11-12).\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 12), it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some\nexamples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world” (UNODA, 2023a, para. 6). In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention\nThe obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state (Moynihan, 2019). Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something (Roscini, 2014).\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test\nThe third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 331). Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense (Irmakkesen, 2014).”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches\nThe question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of\nof critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security (Roscini, 2014). In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force\nAttribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 96), and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities (Roscini, 2014), it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold (Schmitt, 2017, p. 97) as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused (Bergamasco et al. 2020).\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law\nSpace law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of\nspace law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made (UNOOSA, 1967).\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space (Schmitt, 2017). The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 271), while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space (Schmitt, 2017). Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space (UNODA, 2022). Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare (UNODA, 2023b). Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States (ICRC, 2022; U.S. Mission Geneva, 2023).\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” (Olejnik, 2023, para. 8)\nRegardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure\nBuilding on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty\nState A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis\nIn the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a\nrelevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations (Deeks, 2015). That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention\nIt was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis\nThe operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor,\nthe nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force\nState A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis\nA cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n##\nB.

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.\n# 1. Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\". The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739 Received 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024 Available online 23 March 2024 0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\ne armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare. Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear. Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space. There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n## Background: Space infrastructures This section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n### Components of space infrastructures Space infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few. Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure Most, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services. For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient communication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap. As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access.\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures Multiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage. Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit. As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations.\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats. This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites. For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface. There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom. Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments. Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data”. 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems. This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n## The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe. Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police. Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts. In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure Presently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale. Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n### General Principle of sovereignty A foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory”. Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states.\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives”, it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some examples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world”. In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n### Prohibition of intervention The obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state. Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something.\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test The third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such”. Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense.”\n### Target- and effects-based approaches The question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of of critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security. In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force Attribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state”, and a violation of international law can occur.\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities, it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused.\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n### Outer space law Space law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of space law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made.\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space. The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof”, while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space. Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space. Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare. Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States.\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” Regardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure Building on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty State A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n### Analysis In the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a relevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations. That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention It was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n### Analysis The operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor, the nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force State A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n### Analysis A cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n## Conclusion Based on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n## B.

Introduction In 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that\"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\". Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as\"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\".

Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare. Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear. Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space. There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n\n---\n\n## __postscript__\n\nTelecommunications Policy 48 (2024) 102739 # CRediT authorship contribution statement Brianna Bace: Writing - original draft, Resources, Investigation, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2017, NASA's former chief information security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, said in an interview that \"it's a matter of time before someone hacks into something in Space\" (Syeed, 2017, para.3). Within five years of her interview, Russia launched a denial-of-service cyber operation against ViaSat's KA-SAT satellite broadband network, significantly impairing the communication capabilities of Ukrainian citizens, police, and military as Russian forces invaded. In the last twenty years, there have been numerous examples of threat actors using cyber operations to disrupt and destroy critical operations of another state by targeting their critical infrastructure. Cyber operations are defined as \"the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\" (Schmitt, 2017, p. 564). The use of cyber operations to disrupt and destroy the critical operations of an enemy in the context of an\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102739\n\nReceived 30 January 2024; Received in revised form 4 March 2024; Accepted 5 March 2024\n\nAvailable online 23 March 2024\n\n0308-5961/© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
    "e armed conflict is relatively new to the international community. Meanwhile, the use of both kinetic weapons and unconventional weapons, such as cyber operations, is now considered hybrid warfare (Bilal, 2021). Despite whether cyber operations are used inside or outside the context of an armed attack, it is vital that we understand how international law applies to them.\n\nMultiple declarations by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and individual states (CCDCOE, 2023) confirm that international law, including international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict (LOAC), should apply to attacks within the cyber domain. This has been an important step in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the international system. Unfortunately, due to the unique factors of cyber, including its interconnectivity, lack of clear boundaries between private and public sectors, and divergence from traditional geographic concepts, knowing when to apply these laws is much less clear (Corn & Taylor, 2017). Confusion escalates when adopting a perspective focused on space infrastructure, given the scarcity of laws and treaties addressing Space. Moreover, the complexities inherent in cyber, particularly its lack of physical boundaries, further complicate matters within the realm of Space (Bergamasco et al. 2020). There is also a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure as there has been very little state practice and few, if any, statements that qualify opinio juris.\n\nSpace sector systems and infrastructure enable numerous critical functions, including global connectivity, satellite communications, navigation and timing, earth observation, and research and development. Using satellite networks, space systems support telecommunications via TV and radio broadcasting, internet connectivity, and data transmission as satellites can be integrated into existing telecommunications infrastructure to enhance network coverage and capabilities (European Space Agency, n.d.). The information gathered through earth observation also provides valuable data for infrastructure planning. Space-based technologies can make telecommunications more cost effective by reducing infrastructure cost as it is typically cheaper and easier to utilize and deploy satellites than it is to lay new cables or build new ground infrastructure, particularly in remote areas where the infrastructure has been destroyed or does not exist (UNOOSA, n.d.; Hassan et al. 2020; Portillo et al. 2021). These systems, vital for communication advancements such as live streaming, video conferencing, and high-speed internet, will be particularly important in shaping the future of the telecommunications industry.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate how international law can apply to cyber operations on space infrastructure by reviewing some of the relevant legal frameworks and principles of existing international law. We then develop three cyber operation scenarios where space infrastructure is the target, causing impacts significant enough to breach international law. Our paper undertakes this analysis as it is imperative to comprehend the application of international law to these operations. This paper provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law, addressing a crucial gap in the discourse as nations increasingly recognize these systems as critical infrastructure amidst escalating cyber threats.\n\n## Background: Space infrastructures\n\nThis section provides an essential background on the space sector, outlining its key segments, the crucial services and data provided by space systems, and the common vulnerabilities and threats they face. This foundational knowledge is vital for understanding the potential cyber threats and their impact, and it sets the stage for applying legal frameworks to this domain. This section also includes a review of some notable cyber incidents that have occurred against space infrastructure since 2007, including the 2022 attacks by Russia to disrupt Ukrainian communications capabilities at the start of Russia's invasion.\n\n### Components of space infrastructures\n\nSpace infrastructure, or the physical, cyber, and/or human elements that make up the space sector, are often sorted based on four segments: ground, link, space, and user (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The ground segment consists of ground stations, launching facilities, control centers, and data processing centers that collect and send the data collected by satellites. Other ground infrastructure may include ground-based radars, telescopes, signals intercept antennas, and sensors used for space situational awareness to surveil and identify foreign satellites that pass overhead (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). The link segment refers to the communications and data flowing between the ground and user segments to (uplink) and from (downlink) the space segment. The devices or interfaces that derive benefits or make use of the data and information from space-based services are what make up the user segment. This includes user terminals, navigation receivers, communication devices, satellite television and broadcasting stems, to name a few (Manulis et al. 2021). Finally, the space segment includes all space assets not located on Earth. This includes the satellites and satellite networks, manned and unmanned spacecraft, and the International Space Station. Satellites are used for intelligence collection, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, and navigation (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a constellation of satellites used by citizens, government, and the military to collect critical navigation data.\n\n### Criticality and importance of space infrastructure\n\nMost, if not all, critical infrastructure sectors rely on data provided by space systems. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) architecture, and satellite communication (SATCOM) systems play a vital role in ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical functions and essential services (Georgescu et al. 2018). For example, the financial sector requires precise PNT data in order to timestamp transactions; the transportation sector and logistics industry use location data to track shipments, plan routes, and monitor the supply chains; and the emergency services sector relies on SATCOM for reliable and resilient",
    "communication during emergencies, search and rescue, and disaster recovery (National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing, 2021). The military and the Department of Defense also rely on remote-sensing and reconnaissance satellites for national security and defense, as the data collected can be turned into actionable intelligence, such as imagery or geospatial intelligence (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018).\n\nSpace systems data is also used to provide a myriad of applications and experiences that encompass the realms of entertainment and research. Satellite television and radio systems use space systems to broadcast shows, music, and news to users. Weather apps rely on satellites for forecasting, allowing users to access real-time weather information and alerts. Mobile communication applications, live streaming services, and online gaming networks are also made possible with space systems. Finally, observation satellites are used by scientists and researchers to monitor environmental issues such as erosion and deforestation, as well as crop monitoring and wildlife tracking. All these capabilities demonstrate the power of space infrastructure in advancing global connectivity and telecommunications.\n\nSpace-based technology is also vital for future advancement and connectivity. The telecommunications sector, as well as private companies and governments, have begun to invest in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites to bridge the coverage gap (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021). As telecommunications providers strive to meet the growing demands for high-speed internet access and seamless communication, LEO satellites offer a dynamic solution by providing low-latency, high-capacity data transmission. These satellites also overcome geographic accessibility and high building costs for physical infrastructure, two main barriers in providing universal broadband access (Marquina, 2022; Werlé, 2021).\n\n### Threats and vulnerabilities of space infrastructures\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities and threats impact the strength and resiliency of the space sector. Due to the commercialization of the space sector, more companies have begun manufacturing components for space segment infrastructure. This has led to a more complicated supply chain, where it is harder to investigate sufficiently and audit suppliers (Prażák, 2021; Bailey et al. 2019). Without this visibility, attackers can install malicious backdoors in encryption or use cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (Tatar et al. 2020; Vollmer, 2021). Another vulnerability deals with the nature of some space systems, in that assets like satellites are built and then launched into orbit. This makes it difficult to repair and update systems, resulting in the presence of legacy systems with outdated software and firmware and inadequate cybersecurity.\n\nThreats to space systems range from kinetic and non-kinetic physical attacks to electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and natural threats (National Air and Space Intelligence Center, 2018). Kinetic threats include attacks against ground stations and facilities as well as anti-satellite weapons launched from the ground or co-orbitally. There are also non-kinetic physical weapons like directed energy weapons, such as lasers and high-powered microwaves, that aim to blind optical centers or damage the electrical components and corrupt data storage (Amenabar, 2022; Harrison et al. 2022). Space debris is another physical threat to satellites caused by the buildup of space objects around Earth's orbit (Georgescu et al. 2018). As more objects are launched into space, the chance for collision and damage to satellites increases, thus impairing their remote sensing and telecommunications operations (Keles, 2023).\n\nSince space systems utilize interconnected and digital systems, they can also face cyber threats (Housen-Couriel, 2023). This includes attempts by unauthorized actors to command-and-control assets, intercept and exfiltrate data, and cause incidents of denial of service, which are considered to be one of the most common threats to satellites (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). For example, ransomware attacks—a type of malware attack that locks authorized users out of systems until a ransom is paid to the attacker—can cause significant delays in access to essential systems and data. Assuming authorized users can regain access, they must still contend with the ripple effects of loss of service and loss of integrity. Attackers utilizing ransomware have also been known to exfiltrate and release confidential files if the victim fails to pay the ransom, thus resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of data. As of yet, ransomware attacks have been confined to the ground segment of the space sector where there is the greatest attack surface (Falco et al. 2023). There have not been any publicly disclosed ransomware incidents on space systems in orbit, likely due to the difficulty in launching an attack without inadvertently causing irreversible damage to the asset and thus undermining the attacker's likelihood of collecting a ransom (Falco et al. 2023). Yet, Falco et al. (2023) have demonstrated that it is possible to launch a ransomware attack without creating a space brick in the process. Considering the extensive adoption of ransomware by attackers to wreak havoc in other sectors and the space ground segment, incidents of assets in orbit being ransomed appear to be an inevitability.\n\nFinally, there are electronic attacks, such as spoofing, jamming, and eavesdropping, which target the link segment, aiming to compromise, imitate, or illegally capture the communication between the space and ground segments (Kavallieratos & Katsikas, 2023). Like cyber threats, these attacks pose a serious threat, as attackers leverage sophisticated methods to compromise communication, navigation, and surveillance capabilities.\n\n### Review of cyber incidents on space infrastructure\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) repository of counter-space weapons data, there were sixteen cyber operations against space infrastructure between 2007 and 2022, not including attacks launched using electronic weapons or weapons that “target the electromagnetic spectrum through which space systems transmit and receive data” (Bingen et al. 2023, p. 4). 75% of those attacks were launched by a nation-state actor, and more than half of the attacks have targeted space infrastructure owned and operated by the United States (Aerospace Security Project, 2021). Cyber operations on space infrastructure, particularly satellites, target the data being used, transmitted, and controlled by space systems (Bingen et al. 2023). This section provides a brief overview of some of the most well-known attacks that have occurred since 2007.\n\n##",
    "The first cyber operation documented by CSIS took place in April 2007 when a Sri Lankan separatist group hacked an IntelSat communications feed and replaced it with their own broadcast (de Selding, 2007). This attack demonstrated that the barrier to entry that had long kept non-state actors from impacting space infrastructure was diminishing. Also, in 2007, we began to see attacks launched by state actors against satellite command and control systems. Between October 2007 and October 2008, two different American satellites each experienced two separate cyber intrusions. The remote sensing satellite called Landsat-7 was attacked in October 2007 and July 2008. Each attack caused around 12 min of interference with ground station communications (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011), and in the second attack, attackers tried to disguise their origins by using a Norwegian ground station to attack the satellite. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (2011) reported to Congress that in both instances, the attackers failed to achieve all the steps required to command the satellite.The two attacks on NASA's Terra Earth Observation System (EOS) AM-1 differed in this regard. In both attacks on the Terra EOS, attackers “achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands” (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2011, p.216).\n\nA few years later, in September 2014, hackers attacked the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite information and weather systems, which are used by the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies (U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2015). To respond to the attack and prevent the attackers from accessing additional data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping, and user information, the NOAA was forced to take down the system. This kept the NOAA from transmitting satellite images to the National Weather Service for two days.\n\nThe two final attacks we will discuss here are also the attacks that led to the inception of this paper. In February 2022, at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Viasat, a space broadband communications company, reported severe disruption to its ground terminals in Eastern Europe (Burgess, 2022). Tens of thousands of people lost internet connection across Europe, and the loss of communications impacted the Ukrainian military and police (Burgess, 2022). Another denial-of-service attack was launched shortly after on SpaceX's Starlink satellite system. This attack was unique in that it was both an electronic attack and a cyber operation, encompassing jamming and hacking attempts (Lemos, 2023). In contrast to the other incidents we discussed, the hacking of Viasat ground terminals and the satellite Internet service Starlink, all occurred amidst armed conflict.\n\nIn less than two decades, cyber operations on space infrastructure have increased significantly in frequency and severity. These attacks can cause serious disruptions to the critical functions and services satellite systems provide during peacetime and wartime, including communication transmissions and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data. We can also begin to see how applying international law to these types of operations may be challenging, considering the difficulty of attribution in cyberspace. For example, in the Landsat-7, Terra EOS, and Viasat attacks, though victim states had a suspicion of their attacker, they were not successful in attributing to their attacker. The Landsat-7 hack also showed that cyber attackers may use third-party infrastructure to conceal their origins.\n\n## Legal frameworks to analyze cyberattacks on space infrastructure\n\nPresently, there exists no global cyber law for governing cyber operations on an international scale (Bergamasco et al. 2020). Instead, we must look at relevant and existing international law to determine which precise conditions dictate the applicability of international law to cyber activities within the space sector. Increased efforts have been made to apply international law to cyber operations. For instance, UN sessions participated by governmental experts were held to reveal state positions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies with the purpose of advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). The Tallinn Manual produced by the International Group of Experts or ‘Experts' is among the works destined for the same purpose. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 or ‘the Manual' consists of 154 rules reflecting the NATO perspective on governing behavior in the cyber domain both during peacetime as well as during armed conflict. The analysis conducted in this paper adopts a comprehensive approach by considering perspectives from multiple states, avoiding confinement solely to the NATO viewpoint. Differing national stances as well as that of the NATO states derived from UN documents and the Manual are referenced throughout this paper as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force. We also discuss the target- and effects-based approaches, the scale and effects test, and determinant legal precedents for applying these international laws. This section ends with a brief overview of outer space law based on the Outer Space Treaty as a specialized regime of international law and cyberspace, before discussing the main principles and legal precedents used to create the cyberattack scenarios.\n\n### General Principle of sovereignty\n\nA foundational principle of international law is the principle of sovereignty. In Oppenheim's International Law, sovereignty is defined as “the supreme authority of every state within its territory” (Jennings & Watts, 1992, p. 564). Several principles and rules of conventional and customary international law are derived from this principle, including jurisdiction, the principle of due diligence, and the obligation to respect certain immunities of other states (Schmitt, 2017, pp. 11-12).\n\nWhen states affirmed that international law applies to cyberspace, many scholars, including the Experts, believed that this includes sovereignty. The Experts are of the position that since “cyber activities occur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which states may exercise their sovereign prerogatives” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 12), it is possible for cyber operations to violate sovereignty. For a violation of sovereignty to happen, one of two things must occur. Either there is a breach of territorial integrity and violability, or there is an interference with, or usurpation of, inherently governmental functions. Some",
    "examples of inherently governmental functions include the holding of elections, the collection of taxes, or the creation and maintenance of a national defense.\n\nApart from the views posited by the Experts, most states not represented by these experts also sustain that sovereignty as a norm of international law applies in cyberspace. For instance, Pakistan believes that “the principles of non-use of force, sovereign equality of all nations, non-interventionism, and peaceful settlement of disputes, as enshrined in the UN Charter, continue to apply in cyberspace as in the physical world” (UNODA, 2023a, para. 6). In regard to the implementation of international law to information and communication technologies (ICT), Kenya posits that “the UN Charter forms a strong foundation for the interpretation of existing international laws underlined by inter alia the principles of State sovereignty, sovereign equality, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means” (United Nations General Assembly, 2021, p. 54). Likewise, China maintains “the principle of sovereignty applies in cyberspace and that states should exercise jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure, resources, data as well as ICT-related activities within their territories and have the right to protect their information systems and important data against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2021, para.7). Brazil advances that State sovereignty is one of the founding principles of international law, entailing the international responsibility of a State that violates it by means of ICTs (United Nations General Assembly, 2021). On the other hand, while recognizing sovereignty as a governing principle of international law regardless of the venue it prevails, Israel expresses its doubts regarding the boundaries of this principle in cyberspace, citing the scenario of a State conducting a criminal investigation and needing to access data located abroad from its own territory (Schöndorf, 2021).\n\n### Prohibition of intervention\n\nThe obligation of non-intervention is a norm of customary international law. Defined by the International Court of Justice in 1968 during the case Nicaragua v United States of America “Nicaragua v US,” this rule states that a prohibited intervention is one that has “bearing on matters in which each state is permitted, by the principle of state sovereignty, to decide freely” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98). In order for an act, such as a cyber operation, to qualify as a prohibited intervention, it must fulfill certain conditions. First, the operation must impact matters that each state is permitted to decide freely from international obligations and regulations, i.e. domaine réservé. These include internal affairs such as “choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system” (International Court of Justice, 1986, p.98) and external affairs like foreign policy. The operation must also be coercive in nature. While there is not a generally accepted definition of coerciveness, it is understood as an act that would deprive another state of its freedom of choice, as the failure to fulfill the wishes of the attacker state would result in severe consequences for the target state (Moynihan, 2019). Therefore, a cyber operation violates non-intervention if it is accompanied by an intention to coerce the target state to do or not to do something (Roscini, 2014).\n\nLastly, it is worthwhile to note that the views expressed by various states on the applicability of sovereignty in cyberspace are also valid in regard to the applicability of the principle of non-intervention (see 3.1. General Principle of Sovereignty).\n\n### Prohibition of the use of force & the scale and effects test\n\nThe third and final law we will discuss in this paper is the prohibition of the use of force. The prohibition of the use of force, which is outlined in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, states that “All Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations” (United Nations, 1945, p. 3). Though the U.N. Charter does not define “use of force” or offer any criteria, the ‘scale and effects' test from Nicaragua v US judgment is helpful in determining if an act qualifies as a use of force. ‘Scale and effects' is a term meaning that states should analyze quantitative and qualitative factors, or the effects of an attack, to determine if an operation amounts to a use of force. According to the experts, “there is no basis for excluding cyber operations from within the scope of actions that may constitute a use of force if the scale and effects of the operation in question are comparable to those of non-cyber operations that would qualify as such” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 331). Essentially, there is no reason to say that cyber operations cannot be a use of force if they can cause just as much damage as a kinetic attack.“‘Scale and effects' test was originally developed during the Nicaragua v United States case to determine whether actions amount to an ‘armed attack.' An armed attack and a use of force are two different things in international law. ‘Use of force' is used to determine if a state has violated Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. ‘Armed attack' is used as a pre-condition to determine if a state has violated Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, granting the victim state the right of self-defense (Irmakkesen, 2014).”\n\n### Target- and effects-based approaches\n\nThe question of whether an operation amounts to a use of force has been discussed predominantly under two basic approaches. The target-based approach posits that the criticality of a cyber operation's target plays a decisive role in determining whether it qualifies as an armed attack. According to this perspective, the mere intrusion by a state into vital computer systems, such as early warning or command and control systems, or missile defense computer systems, is deemed sufficient to categorize the act as an armed attack, thereby triggering the right to self-defense. Similarly, irrespective of the attacker's identity, the mere occurrence of a cyber operation on critical infrastructure entitles the victim state to an immediate response (Sharp & W. G, 1999; Schmitt, 1999).\n\nThis approach, however, has faced widespread criticism from various angles, primarily due to its establishment of a perilous standard for identifying armed attacks, which is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security. The precise definition of",
    "of critical infrastructure triggering the right to self-defense is left to the discretion of each state, and most states tend to define critical infrastructures broadly. Moreover, states may interpret sporadic failures, breakdowns, outages, or malfunctions of their critical infrastructure as deliberate attacks on their critical assets, leading them to prematurely conclude that they are entitled to use force in self-defense. While the target-based approach facilitates the swift identification of a cyber operation's nature and considers domestic security concerns, it appears to establish a hazardous standard by encouraging states to reach premature and disputed conclusions in the heat of the moment.\n\nContrastingly, the ‘scale and effects' emphasized by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua judgment as crucial factors in determining an armed attack suggest that approaches placing the effects of a cyber operation at the center of this assessment are more compelling. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence of State practice and opinion juris to assert that the target-based approach has evolved into customary international law. Conversely, public statements and official strategy documents of states highlight the accumulation of sufficient State practice and opinion juris in favor of the effects-based approach.\n\nStatements from the former Legal Advisor of the US State Department underscore the ‘physical consequences' as determinative in characterizing an operation as an armed attack, akin to the damage caused by dropping a bomb or firing a missile. The Russian Foreign Minister emphasizes that the destructive effect of a cyber operation must be “comparable to that of weapons of mass destruction” (United Nations General Assembly, 1998, p. 2). The UK Cyber Security Strategy determines the ‘armed' nature of a cyber operation based on its ability to employ “tactics, techniques, and plans to deliver military effects” (Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom, 2011, p.26). Similarly, the Cyber Security Strategy for Germany emphasizes that the failure of, or damage to, the IT systems primarily constitutes a considerable disturbance of public security (Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, 2021).\n\nPanama draws attention to the fact that an attack employing new information and telecommunications technologies may cause more damage than a conventional bombardment. Lastly, Cuba emphasizes that cyber operations should be assessed based on their ability to deliver damage to a state, posing a risk to international peace and security (Roscini, 2014). In light of these considerations, evaluating a cyber operation under the effects-based approach appears more suitable and in line with customary international law.\n\n### The issue of attribution of the use of force\n\nAttribution is an important part of an attack and a deciding factor of whether international law was violated as sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of use of force only apply, though disputably, if the cyber operation was launched by a state actor. This does not mean that an attack launched by a non-state actor can never violate international law; it just means that there must be a sufficient nexus between the actor and the state in question to prove the violation or States fail to fulfill their responsibility to prevent the illegal acts of non-state actors within their territory, an obligation that is rooted in principles of sovereignty, entailing the duty of states to maintain order and security within their borders. Apart from failing to meet the duties associated with such responsibility, namely effective law enforcement, regulatory frameworks, and international cooperation, a state can be held responsible for an attack carried out by a non-state actor if it had ‘effective control' over the operation. The ‘effective control' test came out of the 1986 Nicaragua v U.S. case and is one of the most important pieces of case law used for determining if attribution to a state actor is possible. If a state is found to have exercised ‘effective control' over a non-state actor's operation, then “the latter's actions are attributable to the state” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 96), and a violation of international law can occur.\n\nAnother test that has emerged from case law is the “overall control test” established in the case Prosecutor v. Tadic in 1999 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The overall control test determines whether a state had overall control over the actor, not the attack. While the overall control test may be viewed as less stringent than the effective control test because it focuses on general influence instead of specific activities (Roscini, 2014), it is not useful when discussing cyber operations. According to Roscini (2014), the ICTY applies the overall control test only to the case of an ‘organized and hierarchically structured group” (p.38-39), but organized and hierarchically structured cyber groups do not seem to exist yet.\n\nEffective control has been proven in cases where the state determined how the attack would be executed and decided the specific course of attack, whether the state ordered the operation to begin or end. In contrast, general support from a state to a non-state actor and its operations is not sufficient to establish effective control (Prosecutor v. Tadic, 1999). Also, according to Nicaragua v US judgment, “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” the non-State actor is also not sufficient to reach the effective control threshold (Schmitt, 2017, p. 97) as well. For these reasons, attributing an attack to a State, so that international law may be triggered requires significant evidence. If that evidence can be collected, and the State cannot preclude wrongfulness on the grounds of consent self-defense, countermeasures, force majeure, distress, necessity, or compliance with preemptory norms, then the State would have to make full reparations for the injury caused (Bergamasco et al. 2020).\n\nFortunately, the issue of attribution is seen by some researchers as a technical obstacle more so than a legal issue. According to Roscini (2014), the “apparent lack of territoriality of ‘cyberspace' is not necessarily an obstacle to the application of existing rules” as states can simply focus on “where the prejudicial activity is undertaken and where the effects occur” (p.281). This mindset can be applied to Space as well. While certain space infrastructures like satellites do not exist in a territory, the effects of their disruption or destruction will certainly manifest on Earth's surface.\n\n### Outer space law\n\nSpace law is a specialized area of law that governs the use and exploration of outer space. Today, there exists international laws and treaties to govern state behavior, as well as varying domestic laws and regulations across states and private international law to govern non-state actor behavior (Law Georgetown, 2020). The Outer Space Treaty, known formally as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a foundational treaty of",
    "space law that entered into force in 1967. The Outer Space Treaty established several foundational principles, including emphasizing the peaceful use of outer space, prohibiting the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on a celestial body, and declaring that outer space is free for exploration and use by all states and that no claims of sovereignty of outer space, the moon, or any other celestial bodies, can be made (UNOOSA, 1967).\n\nThe Experts who developed The Tallinn Manual 2.0, use this treaty and others to create rules that address cyber activities in and throughout outer space (Schmitt, 2017). The Experts also define both space objects and space activities. The former refers to “the component and parts of a man-made space object as well as its launch vehicle and parts thereof” (Schmitt, 2017, p. 271), while space activities refer to the use, exploration, or investigation of outer space. These activities must be carried out in accordance with the UN Charter. They can be both public or private and can occur in outer space or on Earth if the activity achieves effects in outer space (Schmitt, 2017). Defining space objects is particularly important as they are the objects that states have jurisdiction over and remain liable for.\n\nContrary to what the Manual envisages concerning outer space, Russia contended in 2022 that International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the body of law regulating armed conflicts, does not apply to military operations in outer space (UNODA, 2022). Interestingly, China, while not explicitly dismissing the applicability of IHL, also expressed reservations about these principles in the context of space warfare (UNODA, 2023b). Conversely, all Western countries maintain a consensus that IHL is indeed applicable in outer space. These laws play a crucial role in safeguarding civilians and civilian objects. The fundamental IHL principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution are likely relevant in outer space operations, at least according to the perspectives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United States (ICRC, 2022; U.S. Mission Geneva, 2023).\n\nHowever, the inherent dual-use nature of certain space infrastructure, such as satellites, presents a considerable challenge in delineating clear boundaries. The ICRC advocates for a straightforward solution: the registration of objects with unequivocal purposes of use to mitigate the complexities of dual-use scenarios, aligning with the Registration Convention's requirements outlined in Article IV(1)(e). This entails specifying the “general function of the space object” (Olejnik, 2023, para. 8)\n\nRegardless, it is imperative that any military operations adhere to the principles of proportionality, ensuring that the force applied aligns with the military objectives pursued and avoids excessive harm to civilian individuals or objects. Rejecting the applicability of such rules creates “law-free” zones in outer space and raises uncertainties regarding the governing principles therein.\n\n## Case studies: Three scenarios of cyber operations on space infrastructure\n\nBuilding on the foundation of historical incidents, this section delves into three meticulously crafted scenarios that simulate cyber attacks on space infrastructures. These scenarios are not mere hypotheticals; they are carefully constructed based on actual events, providing a realistic and tangible context for our discussion. The primary objective here is to explore the application of international law in such situations according to the framework provided in the previous section. By analyzing these scenarios, we aim to shed light on the potential breaches of international legal principles that can arise from cyber operations targeting space assets. These scenarios serve as a bridge, connecting the theoretical aspects of international law with practical, real-world situations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the legal implications and complexities involved in safeguarding space infrastructure against cyber threats.\n\n### Scenario 1: Violation of sovereignty\n\nState A announced yesterday that an unnamed aerospace manufacturing facility destined for military purposes was targeted by a sophisticated cyber operation to extract protected information such as future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. It appears the attackers gained remote access to computers within the facility to extract confidential files and, while in the system, caused permanent damage by overheating hard drives. To stop the operation and regain functionality, the facility had to go offline to sever all network connections and contain further damage. The repair and reinstallation of the hardware and software for facility information systems lasted for a considerable period of time.\n\n### Analysis\n\nIn the scenario described, several legal considerations arise concerning the cyber operation targeting state A's aerospace manufacturing facility and its implications on sovereignty in international law.\n\nThe first step in assessing the breach of sovereignty is attributing the cyber operation to a particular state or non-state actor. If it can be established that the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor, it would constitute a necessary prerequisite for qualifying the operation as a violation of the target State's sovereignty. However, if the attackers remain unnamed and unattributed to any State, this aspect becomes more complex. To that end, an attribution must be established between the act and an agency of the attacking State or an entity that has acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the attacking State.\n\nThe scenario does not specify whether the cyber operation was conducted by a state actor or a non-state actor. However, it is noted in the text that whether non-state actors can violate territorial sovereignty on their own is a matter of disagreement. If the cyber operation is attributed to a non-state actor, the analysis may vary depending on the legal framework applied and the consensus among states regarding the attribution of sovereignty violations to non-state actors.\n\nThe cyber operation resulted in both the extraction of protected information and the permanent damage to the facility's hardware, specifically by overheating hard drives, leading to the facility needing to go offline to contain further damage and undergo repair and reinstallation of hardware and software. The Experts agree that causing physical damage or injury by remote means constitutes a",
    "relevant factor in determining a sovereignty violation. In this case, the overheating of hard drives and the subsequent offline status of the facility for repair would likely qualify as causing a loss of functionality of cyberinfrastructure, thus constituting “damage” and a breach of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are also experts and states who take the position that damage is not a determinative factor by itself.\n\nThe extraction of protected information related to future designs for rockets, spacecraft, and satellites from the aerospace manufacturing facility can be considered as interference with data or services necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. The conduct of such manufacturing activities for military purposes falls within the realm of inherently governmental functions, and therefore, the extraction of such information could further support the argument for a violation of sovereignty. On the other hand, there are views that it would not be considered a violation of sovereignty since this qualifies only as an act of espionage. Traditionally, international law has not regulated peacetime espionage, a sentiment echoed in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which suggests that while peacetime cyber espionage conducted through the interception of international signaling by States may not inherently breach international law, the manner in which it is conducted could potentially do so. However, the methods employed in peacetime cyber espionage vary widely, and there is little legal consensus concerning cyber operations that fall below the threshold of using force or constituting an armed attack. It is important to recognize that while cyber espionage operations are generally not unlawful under international law, they are often prohibited according to the domestic laws of the target State. Furthermore, the authorities of the State engaging in such activities are typically bound by specific domestic legal regulations governing the conduct of foreign intelligence operations (Deeks, 2015). That said, it is the fact that damage was done during the espionage that triggered the violation. Additionally, if the attackers exfiltrated and then deleted critical data, there are some Experts who would consider this a violation of sovereignty based on its impact on inherently governmental function.\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 outlines various modalities for determining what constitutes a sovereignty violation in the context of cyber operations. While there may not be a universal agreement on the precise threshold for a loss of functionality, the significant impact on the facility's operations and the subsequent need for repair and reinstallation of hardware and software would likely meet or exceed any proposed threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided scenario and the legal analysis, the cyber operation targeting State A's aerospace manufacturing facility likely constitutes a violation of sovereignty under international law, considering the extent of damage, the interference with inherently governmental functions, and the impact on the facility's operations. However, the attribution of the operation to a specific state actor remains a crucial factor in determining the full legal implications and potential consequences in accordance with international law.\n\n### Scenario 2: Violation of prohibition of intervention\n\nIt was announced by State A that the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) was the target of a ransomware attack. The GPS MCS is operated by State A's Space Operations Command to provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners. The ransomware significantly disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network, thus delaying their ability to transmit PNT data and communicate with the satellite. In addition to demanding monetary payment, the ransom indicated that the threat actor would target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. Fortunately, State A indicated that they were successful in stopping the attack without paying the ransom or bending to the attackers' commands.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe operation of the Master Control Station (MCS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) by State A's Space Operations Command falls within the domaine réservé of State A. The provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) data to its military and other partners constitutes a critical aspect of State A's external affairs and its national security apparatus. Therefore, any interference with the operation of the GPS MCS touches upon matters within State A's sovereignty.\n\nFurthermore, on the question of whether a ransomware attack can be considered coercive in nature, two primary approaches have emerged within the context of cyber activities. According to the first approach, an act is deemed coercive if its purpose is to compel the victim State to alter its behavior concerning matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. The crucial aspect here is that the act must have the potential to force the target State into action it would not otherwise take or to refrain from actions it would otherwise undertake. In contrast, the second approach defines “coercion” as effectively depriving the target State of its ability to control or govern matters within its exclusive jurisdiction. This approach differs from the former by acknowledging that simply depriving the target State of control over a protected matter, without actually or potentially compelling it to change its behavior, may still constitute intervention. Depending on the approach employed in this scenario, the ransomware attack on the GPS MCS might arguably be considered coercive in nature (Cyber Law Toolkit, Ransomware campaign). The threat actor not only disrupted the ability of the Space Operations Command to access the station's network but also explicitly threatened to target all six monitor stations and the backup MCS with destructive malware unless State A ceased all humanitarian initiatives abroad. This demonstrates an attempt to compel State A to change its behavior regarding its humanitarian initiatives through coercive means.\n\nRelatedly, there is a clear causal nexus between the ransomware attack and its effect on State A's external affairs and sovereignty. The attack disrupted the transmission of PNT data and communication with satellites, which are critical components of State A's military and security operations. Additionally, the threat to target other critical infrastructure unless certain demands were met further demonstrates the impact on State A's ability to govern its affairs without external interference.\n\nWhile the scenario does not explicitly mention the attribution of the ransomware attack to a specific state or state-sponsored actor,",
    "the nature of the attack, including the explicit demands related to State A's humanitarian initiatives abroad, suggests the involvement of a state or state-sponsored actor. If the attack can be attributed to another state, its agents, or entities operating under their instruction, direction, or control, it would further underscore the violation of State A's sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention.\n\nIn sum, this scenario violates the prohibition of intervention as it meets both elements of intervention. First, the object of the cyber operation was another state's internal or external affairs. Second, the attackers used methods of coercion as they intended to pressure the target state. Even though the coercion was unsuccessful, the conduct of the perpetrating State is evidence of their attempt to deprive another state of choice in a matter reserved to the targeted State and is thus a violation of prohibited intervention.\n\n### Scenario 3: Violation of use of force\n\nState A announced yesterday that a satellite in a military network was targeted by a cyber operation launched by a state actor. Preliminary investigations indicate that the threat actor accessed the command-and-control system of the satellite via a workstation of an operator with privileged systems access at the ground station.\n\nThe attackers had control of the satellite for approximately 3 h, in which they issued commands to make the satellite inoperable. The disruption led to a loss of communication capabilities for civilians, as well as police, emergency services, and the military. This disruption resulted in serious injury to about 25 people and the death of 4 people, including soldiers who were inadvertently sent to enemy territory and civilians who could not be connected to life-supporting systems.\n\n### Analysis\n\nA cyber operation can qualify as a use of force if its scale and effects are equivalent to those of a kinetic attack. In this scenario, the cyber operation resulted in physical harm and casualties, including loss of life and serious injury to individuals. The effects of the cyber operation are comparable to those of a traditional armed attack, as they resulted in severe disruption to critical communication systems and harm to individuals.\n\nGiven the severity of the consequences, including loss of life and injury, caused by the cyber operation targeting State A's satellite, it meets the threshold for use of force under international law. As such, the cyber operation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Additionally, the operation may also be considered a breach of other rules of international law, such as the prohibition of intervention and the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states.\n\nLast but not least, State A, as the victim State, may hold the state actor responsible for the cyber operation accountable under international law. The consequences of the cyber operation, including loss of life and injury, would likely lead to diplomatic and legal repercussions, potentially including demands for reparations, sanctions, or recourse to international dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. This analysis also showed the importance of looking at the features of a cyber operation individually. Due to the diverse nature of cyber operations and the effects that they can have on a given infrastructure, a review of the legality of an attack and whether it amounts to a violation of international law should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Performing these kinds of analyses signals that cyberspace, including cyber operations on space infrastructure, is subject to existing rules that govern state behavior. While these rules may have been created with kinetic weaponry in mind, it is possible to interpret these laws in the cyber-context so that the peace and stability of the international community are maintained. Without these laws, the security of the international community would be put at risk as cyber operations are increasing in prevalence and the attack surface of the space sector continues to grow.\n\nNevertheless, as shown in the analyses above, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements. Sovereignty, as a core principle of international law, encompasses both internal and external components. In the context of cyberspace, sovereignty entails a state's authority over its cyber infrastructure, activities, and the right to exercise control within its territory. However, the interconnected nature of cyberspace poses challenges to traditional notions of sovereignty, as demonstrated by the ability of threat actors to target critical infrastructure across borders.\n\nRelatedly, attribution is yet another issue that compounds the application of these laws in cyberspace. While the norms and principles covered above primarily apply between states, the evolving nature of cyber threats raises questions about the involvement of non-state actors and the attribution of cyber operations to states. The legal ambiguity surrounding non-state actors and the challenge of attribution in cyberspace create a complex landscape for state actors. This uncertainty often compels them to navigate cautiously, leading to a tendency to conduct cyber operations in ambiguous or gray areas. Furthermore, the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks to specific actors can make it challenging for states to take decisive action or publicly announce their national stance on certain cyber activities within these gray zones. This dynamic underscores the intricate balancing act that states must navigate in cyberspace, where legal uncertainties and attribution challenges can impact their strategic decision-making processes.\n\nWhile this paper set out to argue that existing international law could be applied to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, potentially impeding the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios. International actors and decision-makers must strive to develop clear norms and legal frameworks and establish robust protection and enforcement mechanisms that recognize the intricacies of cyberspace and outer Space to safeguard the integrity of the space domain and uphold the principles of international legal order.\n\n##",

Amid escalating cyber threats, this paper examines the application of international law to cyber operations targeting space infrastructure, addressing a critical gap in discourse. While declarations by global entities affirm the applicability of international law to cyberattacks, the complexities of cyberspace, compounded by the unique aspects of space infrastructure, pose challenges in implementation. Recognizing the absence of global cyber law and a lack of customary international law regarding cyber operations on space infrastructure, this study provides one of the first legal examinations via case analysis of cyberattacks on space infrastructures, both terrestrial and orbital, through the lens of international humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, and outer space law. This paper adopts a comprehensive approach, considering perspectives from differing national stances as we review three main principles of international law: the general principle of sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force. Based on our analysis of three hypothetical but realistic cyber operation scenarios, international law can apply to cyberattacks on space infrastructure, and violations can occur if all conditions of a given law are met and attribution can be made to a state actor. Yet, applying these laws in a cyber context has proven to cause some complexities and disagreements, and it would be a mistake to ignore the reality that there is still significant ambiguity and varying interpretations, which could impede the unequivocal enforcement and application of these laws in such scenarios.",
