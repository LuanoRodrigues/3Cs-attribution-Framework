But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\n\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\n\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n\n# AUTHOR\n\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

REV. 520 (2020)\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFiguring out who's doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.¹ Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.² Another is insurance coverage.³ Invoking\n\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 2019) (denying petitions for rehearing en banc).",

But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\n\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,⁷ scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n\n4.

On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.¹⁰ Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.¹¹ This results in a double challenge for\n\n8.

Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n\n10.

Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\n\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,¹³ it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\n\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\n\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics.

In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n\n¹².

The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\n\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17]\n\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized.

Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19]\n\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J.

Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶\n\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n\n20.

When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\n\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions.

Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available.

For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\n\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases.

Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed.

For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\n\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\n\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace.

In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.¹⁶⁴\n\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵\n\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n\n¹⁶³.

If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹\n\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\n\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\n\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n\n¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11.

They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary.

This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\n\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\n\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\n\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,¹⁷³ it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.¹⁷⁴ In\n\n171.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”²⁰⁸ These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.²⁰⁹ Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”²¹⁰ ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.²¹¹ In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\n\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\n\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n\n²⁰⁸.

The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n\n# 1. Why Legalize?\n\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\n\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J.

Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.²¹⁶\n\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.²¹⁷ And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\n\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law.

But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\n\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.²¹⁸ This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.²¹⁹ States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.²²⁰\n\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n\n219.

The most likely explanations do not withstand scrutiny, however, and other incentives should counsel in favor of developing a legal standard.\n\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.²²¹ Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\n\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.²²² If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.²²³ Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”²²⁴ Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n\n221.

Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,²²⁶ but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\n\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance.²²⁷ If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\n\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n\n225.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,²²⁸ but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace—an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.²²⁹ This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.²³⁰\n\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.²³¹ Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well.

See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility.

Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf.

Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\n\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\n\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\n\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.”²³³ A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n\n232.

In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\n\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are.

Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.²⁴² These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act;²⁴³ such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\n\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.²⁴⁴ Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace.

For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.²⁴⁶ That is the domain of international law.\n\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\n\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.²⁴⁷ Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\n\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n\n247.

Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.²⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”²⁵⁰\n\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.²⁵¹\n\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n\n248.

The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\n\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form.

Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.²⁶⁰ Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.²⁶¹ A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.²⁶² Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\n\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\n\nConsider macro-level deterrence.

These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.²⁶⁴ Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal.

But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\n\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\n\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\n\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n\n266.

International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law.²⁶⁸ In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,²⁶⁹ setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.²⁷⁰\n\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.²⁷¹ Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.²⁷² Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n\n269.

This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace.

In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n\n272.

The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.²⁷³ That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”²⁷⁴ States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”²⁷⁵ Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.²⁷⁶ This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\n\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations.

Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.²⁸² Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\n\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n\n281.

DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\n\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\n\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\n\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.²⁸⁴\n\n283.

At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\n\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity.

This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).³¹¹ An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.³¹² But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.³¹³\n\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.³¹⁴\n\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease.

A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n\n310.

Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\n\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.³¹⁷ For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.³¹⁸ Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.³¹⁹ By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim.³²⁰ These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.³²¹ Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,³²² and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.³²³ The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n\n317.

A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\n\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\n\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\n\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some\n\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325.

A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.³²⁸ After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,³²⁹ and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.³³⁰ To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.³³¹ But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\n\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\n\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation.

There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,³³² but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\n\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\n\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.³³³ As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n\n³³².

Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.³³⁴ The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\n\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n\n³³⁴ Cf.

Law Review\n# The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution\nKristen E. Eichensehr\n# ABSTRACT\nAttribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

REV. 520 (2020)\n# INTRODUCTION\nFiguring out who's doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.¹ Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.² Another is insurance coverage.³ Invoking\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 2019) (denying petitions for rehearing en banc).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncoverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.⁴ Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline⁵ to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.⁶ The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,⁷ scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n4.

REV. 520 (2020)\nof international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.⁸ But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.⁹ A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.¹⁰ Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.¹¹ This results in a double challenge for\n8.

One of the best treatments of the relationship between attributions and international law is Martha Finnemore &amp; Duncan B. Hollis, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity, EURO. J. INT’L L. (forthcoming 2020) (draft dated Oct. 30, 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347958. Like this Article, Finnemore and Hollis make the point that public attributions (which they call “accusations”) can contribute to the formation of international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n10. Of course, some modifications are necessary. See, e.g., Kristen E. Eichensehr, Cyberwar and International Law Step Zero, 50 TEX.

Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,¹³ it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics.

INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n¹². The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F.

REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n¹³. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17]\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling\n14.

See infra Part III.\nCyberattack Attribution\ndefense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19]\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nAs Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”²⁰ In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.²¹\nNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n20. Lin, supra note 19, at 89.\n21. Id. at 89–90.\n22. For overviews of the technical aspects of attribution, see JOHN S. DAVIS II ET AL., STATELESS ATTRIBUTION: TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CYBERSPACE 9–16 (2017), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2000/RR2081/RAND_RR2081.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UNZ-XK9S]; Lin, supra note 19, at 80–84; and Thomas Rid &amp; Ben Buchanan, Attributing Cyber Attacks, 38 J. STRATEGIC STUD. 4, 14–23 (2015).\n23. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 15 (describing “atomic, behavioural, and computed” indicators of compromise).\n24. See id. at 17–18 (discussing reuse of infrastructure and software as means of attributing attacks).\n25. See id. at 19; see also Lin, supra note 19, at 90 (“[T]he language setting for the keyboard of a particular computer . . . raises the likelihood that a human perpetrator is from a nation in which that language is used.”).\n26. See, e.g., Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 19 (discussing potential use of language indicators in false flag operations). The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia).\nCyberattack Attribution\nMoving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States\nThe practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.[28] The first public accusation by the U.S. government\n27.

REV. 520 (2020)\nthe purview of the Treasury Department. Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals \"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\" including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.[48] In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.[49] The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.[50] Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were \"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack\n48. Exec. Order No. 13,694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077, 18,077-78 (Apr. 2, 2015). Sanctions under the Executive Order do not depend on foreign government involvement; the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions for routine cybercrime issues as well. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Sanctions Two Individuals for Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities (Dec. 29, 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0693.aspx [https://perma.cc/C2CB-SP6N] (detailing sanctions against two Russians for distribution of malware and associated theft of information). The Treasury Department has also used country-specific sanctions regimes to attribute cyberattacks to foreign governments. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Imposes Sanctions Against the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Jan. 2, 2015), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl9733.aspx [https://perma.cc/8BWT-LMTP] [hereinafter North Korea Sanctions Press Release] (detailing sanctions imposed against North Korean government and related entities for the hack of Sony Pictures). In May 2019, the European Union established a cyberspecific sanctions regime that, like the U.S. sanctions regime, permits imposition of travel bans and asset freezes for \"persons or entities that are responsible for cyber-attacks or attempted cyber-attacks, who provide financial, technical or material support for such attacks or who are involved in other ways.\" Press Release, Council of the European Union, Cyber-Attacks: Council Is Now Able to Impose Sanctions (May 17, 2019), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions [https://perma.cc/96S3-WTHM].\n49.

Order No. 13,757, supra note 49, at 3 (listing Russian individuals and entities designated).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntargeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51\nThe third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing\n51. North Korea Sanctions Press Release, supra note 48.\n52.

For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement,⁶⁰ and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later.⁶¹ Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.⁶²\nThe attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement⁶³ with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers.⁶⁴ Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n58.

In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard.⁶⁸ The ransomware encrypted data on infected machines, locking victims out of their files unless they paid $300 in Bitcoin.⁶⁹ In the United Kingdom, some hospitals diverted ambulances and patients, and\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/index.php/news/press-releases/sm0312 [https://perma.cc/9MXW-EJZG] [hereinafter Russia Sanctions Press Release].\n65.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution\nStates should be substantiated.\"¹⁰⁹ But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.¹¹⁰\nSince the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated.¹¹¹ Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example.

In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets,¹²⁶ but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.¹²⁷ The closest the United States came to\n¹²³.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.[130] For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government.[131] It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.[132]\nThird and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”¹³⁷ Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.¹³⁸ In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.¹³⁹\n## C. The Purposes of Attribution\nVery often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility.

REV. 520 (2020)\nOne of the most frequently cited purposes of public attributions is macro-level deterrence.¹⁴⁰ The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”¹⁴¹ U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.¹⁴² The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”¹⁴³\nVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.¹⁴⁴ The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.¹⁴⁵ Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n¹⁴⁰.

Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n146.

But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.[150] Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.[151] Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,[152] though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may\n150.

Ministry of Def., supra note 91 (noting that the government publicized the Russian officers involved in order to \"hamper any further attempts by them to operate internationally\").\n151. A similar micro-level deterrence strategy may be influencing reported U.S. operations to alert individual Russian operatives that the United States is aware of their election interference-related actions. See Julian E. Barnes, U.S. Begins First Cyberoperations Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections, N.Y.

Even commentators skeptical of macro-level deterrence acknowledge the potential micro-level deterrent effect of public attributions. See Goldsmith &amp; Williams, supra note 148 (\"The indictments rarely result in prosecution but do expose the alleged wrongdoers publicly, prevent them from traveling and perhaps embarrass them in certain circles. These costs are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyberintruders and their principals surely take them into account\").\nCyberattack Attribution\nbe less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. $^{153}$ The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. $^{154}$ Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. $^{155}$\nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.[156] Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.[157] This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS \"contain[ed] indicators of\n153. See, e.g., Nakashima, supra note 150 (discussing the arrest of a Russian hacker in the Netherlands).\n154. Relatedly, governmental and nongovernmental attributors should consider the likely consequences to individual hackers outed in attributions; the consequences imposed by their national governments may be far worse than any by the attributing entity. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 530-31 (highlighting due process and privacy concerns stemming from attributions to particular individuals).\n155. See, e.g., Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that U.S. indictments \"can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks\"). However, these tactics may backfire. See America's Government Is Putting Foreign Cyber-Spies in the Dock, ECONOMIST (Sept. 13, 2018), https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/13/americas-government-is-putting-foreign-cyber-spies-in-the-dock [https://perma.cc/2CFF-NP7K] (reporting that U.S. government hackers are concerned that U.S. indictments could prompt retaliation, such as arrests of U.S. government hackers).\n156.

See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 17 (\"[A] public attribution statement may encourage victims or other vulnerable populations to bolster network defenses.\"); Hunt, supra note 38 (explaining the U.K. strategy to accompany public attributions with details about \"how [a cyber intrusion] was done, thereby helping the cyber security industry to develop protective measures\"); MANDIANT, supra note 121, at 6 (explaining publication of the APT1 report that attributed intrusions to China on the grounds that \"we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively\").\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncompromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\" and specifically noted that the alert aimed \"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n158. Alert TA18-074A, supra note 57.\n159. But see Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (asserting that \"deterrence by denial . . . is indifferent to attribution\").\n160. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 27, at 75 art. 22 (\"The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\").\n161. See id. at 129 art. 49 para. 1 (\"An injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act.\"); see also Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hung. v. Slovk.), 1997 I.C.J. 7, 55 (Sept. 25) (explaining that for a countermeasure to be lawful \"it must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State\").\n162. See supra notes 144-145 and accompanying text (discussing private attributions).\nCyberattack Attribution\n557\nSuch lack of clarity about states' actions is not unique to cyberattacks,¹⁶³ but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.¹⁶⁴\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n¹⁶³. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n¹⁶⁴.

If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n¹⁶⁹. *Id.* at 11–12.\n¹⁷⁰. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution\n## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION\nAssuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,¹⁷³ it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.¹⁷⁴ In\n171. Green, supra note 11, at 165 (“[I]nternational law does not have a clear benchmark against which the persuasiveness or reliability of evidence may be gauged for the purposes of attributing responsibility or assessing legal claims.”); Mary Ellen O’Connell, Evidence of Terror, 7 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 19, 21 (2002) (lamenting the lack of “any well-established set of rules governing evidence in international law in general or in the case of self-defence in particular”).\n172. See Green, supra note 11, at 163 (“[T]he evidentiary standards applicable to the law on the use of force, as with international law more generally, remain extremely unclear.”); O’Connell, supra note 171, at 21 (“How much objective evidence is needed before responding with force [in self-defense to an armed attack] is largely an open question.”).\n173.

See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 166 (noting that the ICJ “has avoided explicitly articulating a general standard with regard to its decisions” and “has employed different standards, depending upon the dispute before it”); Roscini, supra note 11, at 248 (“The\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nthe 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence.¹⁷⁵ She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.”¹⁷⁶ She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear,¹⁷⁷ noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.”¹⁷⁸ Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”¹⁷⁹\nThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide.¹⁸⁰ The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”¹⁸¹ In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.”¹⁸² Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense\nICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n175.

[to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"¹⁸⁵\nScholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice.¹⁸⁶ Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing \"convincing\" or\n¹⁸³. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including \"clear and convincing,\" preponderance, and \"prima facie evidence,\" in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n¹⁸⁴. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\" is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n¹⁸⁵.

Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n¹⁸⁶. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may \"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n67 UCLA L.

Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had \"clear and compelling information\" that Al Qaeda \"had a central role in the attacks.\"¹⁸⁹ The \"clear and compelling\" phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions.¹⁹⁰ It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.¹⁹¹\nWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.”¹⁹² For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense.¹⁹³ If the most serious international offenses, such as\n187.

But how much lower?\nState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.”¹⁹⁵ The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”¹⁹⁶\nTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release.¹⁹⁷ Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions.¹⁹⁸ But some in the cybersecurity community publicly\n(Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n¹⁹⁴.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”²⁰⁸ These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.²⁰⁹ Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”²¹⁰ ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.²¹¹ In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n²⁰⁸.

REV. 520 (2020)\nattacked or identify the perpetrator.[212] But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J. INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within\nCyberattack Attribution\na normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.²¹⁵ States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.²¹⁶\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.²¹⁷ And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course,\nthe bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n²¹⁵. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent . . . to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n²¹⁶. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n²¹⁷. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.²¹⁸ This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.²¹⁹ States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.²²⁰\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n219. See, e.g., Qihoo 360, The CIA Hacking Group (APT-C-39) Conducts Cyber-Espionage Operation on China's Critical Industries for 11 Years, 360 CORE SECURITY (Mar. 2, 2020), https://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html [https://perma.cc/22FW-SLXS] (accusing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of hacking targets in China). Arguably, Kaspersky has also accused the United States, though not explicitly.

Even a requirement to provide evidence is not a foolproof deterrent. Evidence can be faked. See, e.g., Bobby Chesney &amp; Danielle Citron, Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security, 107 CALIF. L. REV. 1753 (2019) (discussing the pernicious possible effects of deep fake video and audio recordings).\nCyberattack Attribution\n569\ndetail. The most likely explanations do not withstand scrutiny, however, and other incentives should counsel in favor of developing a legal standard.\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.²²¹ Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.²²² If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.²²³ Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”²²⁴ Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n221. See Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (noting that “the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information” to support the attribution).\n222. Cf. Ashley S. Deeks, *Predicting Enemies*, 104 VA. L. REV. 1529, 1589–90 (2018) (urging the United States to be transparent about its legal and policy decisions on military use of algorithms in order to shape the direction of international law in the area).\n223. See infra notes 277–278 and accompanying text (discussing U.N. General Assembly resolutions).\n224.

REV. 520 (2020)\nprosecutors can produce.²²⁵ Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,²²⁶ but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance.²²⁷ If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n225. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler, Viewing CSI and the Threshold of Guilt: Managing Truth and Justice in Reality and Fiction, 115 YALE L.J. 1050, 1052 (2006) (describing the \"CSI effect\" as occurring when \"people who watch the series develop unrealistic expectations about the type of evidence typically available during trials, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they will have a 'reasonable doubt' about a defendant's guilt\").\n226. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 211, at 130 (noting that assessing the existence of \"a general practice\" for purposes of customary international law \"refers primarily to the practice of States\" and sometimes to \"the practice of international organizations,\" while \"[c]onduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice\" of states). But see id. at 132 (explaining that in some circumstances the conduct of nonstate and noninternational organization entities like corporations \"may have an indirect role in the identification of customary international law, by stimulating or recording the practice and acceptance as law (opinio juris) of States\").\n227. See, e.g., JACK GOLDSMITH, HOOVER INST., CYBERSECURITY TREATIES: A SKEPTICAL VIEW (2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf [https://perma.cc/2DLX-V979] (discussing hurdles, including verification, to cybersecurity treaties).\nCyberattack Attribution\n571\neffects, supporting stability and helping to avoid conflict over cyberspace. Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,²²⁸ but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace—an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.²²⁹ This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.²³⁰\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.²³¹ Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to\n228. See H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94 (3d ed., 2012) (explaining that “while primary rules are concerned with the actions that individuals must or must not do, these secondary rules are all concerned with the primary rules themselves” and determine, among other things how violation of primary norms can be “conclusively determined”).\n229. See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility. Secondary rules lay out the general conditions for a State’s responsibility, as well as the consequences of violating a primary rule.”); Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 27, at 31 (distinguishing between the primary rules that “define the content of international obligations, [and] the breach of which gives rise to responsibility,” and “the secondary rules of State responsibility”).\n230. Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf. Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 116, at 636 (making the converse point that currently “[t]he legal uncertainty surrounding the attribution process may also tip the balance, at times, toward maintaining silence and ambiguity concerning cyberoperations”); see also infra note 280 and accompanying text (discussing how the proposed evidentiary standard can level the playing field for provision of evidence).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncomply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency²³²—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.”²³³ A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n232. See infra note 304 and accompanying text (discussing a new attribution entity as a way to standardize private attributors’ methodologies).\n233. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE CRIMINAL § 111 (4th ed.); see also U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MANUAL § 9–11.101 (2018), https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.101 [https://perma.cc/GFA5-XDPN] (“[T]he grand jury’s principal function is to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that one or more persons committed a certain Federal offense within the venue of the district court.”).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged.²³⁴ The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”²³⁵\nThe standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme.²³⁶ The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts.²³⁷ A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action\n234.

If the grand jury returns an indictment, the prosecutor then chooses whether to sign it and proceed with the case, which would ultimately be determined based on the usual criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. See WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 233, § 101 (explaining that prosecutors have “ultimate veto power over a grand jury decision to indict”); U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, supra note 233, § 9-27.200–250 (discussing considerations prosecutors must take into account in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution).\n235.

Although the U.S. indictments are among the most detailed attributions, the ICJ, for its part, has discounted the value of indictments in establishing international legal responsibility in other contexts. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 132, § 217 (Feb. 26) (explaining that because “the claims made by the Prosecutor in the indictments are just that—allegations made by one party . . . , as a general proposition the inclusion of charges in an indictment cannot be given weight”).\n236.

REV. 520 (2020)\nonly if it is ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”²³⁸\nOne might think that domestic law standards are sufficient to govern attributions. In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court.²³⁹ For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.”²⁴⁰ Other governments use the\n238.

See OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN OVERVIEW 2011, at 59–60 (2011) (providing an overview of “estimative language” used by the intelligence community); see also OFFICE OF THE DIR.

ODNI’s Guide to Cyber Attribution defines “high confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of evidence and context to be beyond a reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative,” and defines “moderate confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of the evidence and context to be clear and convincing, with only circumstantial cases for alternatives.” OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, supra note 38, at 4. Despite echoing the language of legal standards, it is not clear that these standards as used by the intelligence community mean the same thing as the same linguistic formulations used in courts. In any event, the intelligence community assessments are not subject to judicial review.\n240. BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES, supra note 239, at 3 (emphasis added).\nCyberattack Attribution\nsame estimative language.²⁴¹ Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.²⁴² These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act;²⁴³ such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.²⁴⁴ Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards\n241. See, e.g., Press Release, U.K. Nat'l Cyber Sec. Centre, supra note 95 (noting that the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre \"assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU was almost certainly responsible\" for the 2016 hack of the DNC and subsequent release of stolen documents).\n242. But see Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that cybercrime charges are \"brought only when the facts and law justify\" them and \"we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt\").\n243. See supra note 161 (discussing requirements for countermeasures).\n244. Cf. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 13 (noting that public attributions \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\").\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nwould not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.²⁴⁵\nAdditionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.²⁴⁶ That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.²⁴⁷ Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n247. See Eichensehr, supra note 10, at 358 (terming this the “international law step-zero question”); see generally Rebecca Crootof, Regulating New Weapons Technology, in THE IMPACT OF EMERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (Eric Talbot Jensen &amp; Ronald T.P. Alcala eds., forthcoming 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195980 (discussing various factors for determining when new international law is required to regulate new weapons technologies).\nCyberattack Attribution\nFor the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.²⁴⁸ For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.²⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”²⁵⁰\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.²⁵¹\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n248. See supra notes 173–190 and accompanying text.\n249. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 129, ♦ 209 (Feb. 26) (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n250. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 82. Ultimately, the Manual takes a very on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach. After suggesting that the graver the attack the more evidence will be required, the Manual then notes essentially the opposite logic: states facing severe cyberattacks may be less able to muster robust attribution evidence than states facing less significant attacks. Id.\n251. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81 (“With respect to ex ante uncertainty as to the attribution of cyber operations, . . . States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.”); Egan, supra note 112.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility.²⁵² Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,²⁵³ including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante,²⁵⁴ and accountability for decisions ex post.²⁵⁵\nThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may\n252. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 28 (arguing that when details about attribution “are made public, the quality of the attribution is likely to increase” and that publication “may generate new evidence and analysis”).\n253.

The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259]\n256. See supra notes 121–125 and accompanying text.\n257. See Nakashima, supra note 125 (discussing confirmations by Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect).\n258. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 27–28 (describing the 2014 PLA indictment as “exceptionally detailed” despite the fact that it contained “very few forensic details” as compared to the Mandiant APT1 report on the same actors).\n259. See, e.g., Alert TA17–132A, supra note 53 (providing indicators of compromise related to WannaCry and noting that the alert was updated after the U.S. government attributed WannaCry to North Korea); see also Alert TA18–074A, supra note 57 (providing indicators of compromise and other technical details related to Russian government targeting of various critical infrastructure sectors). Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.²⁶⁰ Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.²⁶¹ A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.²⁶² Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures.²⁶³ For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution—\nROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n²⁶⁰. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n²⁶¹. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n²⁶². See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n²⁶³. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution\nand thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.²⁶⁴ Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.²⁶⁵ If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable\n264. See supra text accompanying note 245 (discussing how domestic law provides an evidentiary floor for some mechanisms used to attribute cyberattacks to states).\n265. See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncrosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n266. For discussions of, for example, whether election interference violates the prohibition on intervention, see Ryan Goodman, International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference, JUST SECURITY (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www.justsecurity.org/35999/international-law-response-russian-election-interference [https://perma.cc/M4P3-A58L], and Duncan Hollis, Russia and the DNC Hack: What Future for a Duty of Non-Intervention?, OPINIJOURIS (July 25, 2016), http://opiniojuris.org/2016/07/25/russia-and-the-dnc-hack-a-violation-of-the-duty-of-non-intervention [https://perma.cc/WAP8-7TNZ].\n267. See supra notes 160-161 and accompanying text (discussing countermeasures).\nCyberattack Attribution\ninternational law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law.²⁶⁸ In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,²⁶⁹ setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.²⁷⁰\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.²⁷¹ Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.²⁷² Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n269. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text.\n270. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text (discussing the iterative process of norm-creation through attributions).\n271. This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace. See Elaine Korzak, *UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?*, DIPLOMAT (July 31, 2017), https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe [https://perma.cc/29T4-QMXK] (discussing disagreement in the 2017 GGE over international law). In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n272. See, e.g., supra notes 258–259 and accompanying text (discussing technical details and government attributions).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.²⁷³ That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”²⁷⁴ States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”²⁷⁵ Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.²⁷⁶ This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard.²⁷⁷ Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing\n273. See supra notes 208–211 and accompanying text.\n274. Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 211, at 141.\n275. Id. at 139.\n276. The proposed customary international law rule would instantiate several of the features that Laurence Helfer and Ingrid Wuerth suggest make the formation of custom more likely, including having “powerful states (or groups of like-min[d]ed countries) advance new rules that respond to emerging global problems or seek to overcome distributional differences by promoting rules with compelling normative content.” Helfer &amp; Wuerth, supra note 216, at 609.\n277.

In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.²⁸⁰ Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard\n278. See Int'l Law Comm'n, *supra* note 211, at 147–48 (discussing the role of resolutions of international organizations in constituting and reflecting international law, and noting that U.N.

REV. 520 (2020)\npractice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet²⁸¹ and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.\n***\nThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary *lex specialis*, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.²⁸² Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n281. Cf. infra note 304 and accompanying text (noting private attributors’ divergences in methodology).\n282.

DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.²⁸⁴\n283. See, e.g., Jasmin Johurun Nessa, *Self-Defense in International Law: What Level of Evidence?*, JUST SECURITY (July 8, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/64796/self-defense-in-international-law-what-level-of-evidence [https://perma.cc/QLD9-7MX5] (discussing the Iran examples and debates about the standard of evidence required for self defense).\n284. JASON HEALEY ET AL., ATLANTIC COUNCIL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN CYBERSPACE: A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY 10 (2014),\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nThe Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.”²⁸⁵ The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,”²⁸⁶ and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.²⁸⁷\nAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.²⁸⁸ Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.”²⁸⁹ Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish.²⁹⁰ Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.”²⁹¹ The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”²⁹²\nAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.²⁹³ RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n285.

Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.[300] Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.[301] An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often\n294.

For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.”³⁰² Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.”³⁰³ It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”³⁰⁴\nFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.”³⁰⁵ This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.³⁰⁶ An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.³⁰⁷ This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n302. Id. at 20.\n303. Id. at 19.\n304.

HEALEY ET AL., supra note 284, at 10 (noting that the proposed Council “can help raise the expected attribution for states with lower attribution capacity by leveraging that of advanced cyber powers”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309]\nA new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process.

REV. 520 (2020)\ngovernments out may exacerbate the perception that the entity's attributions are politicized or that its choice of cases to investigate is skewed.³¹⁰\nAll of these challenges suggest that while there is value to creating an entity in some form, it should become an additional participant in the current decentralized attribution system—centralization within decentralization as it were. This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).³¹¹ An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.³¹² But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.³¹³\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.³¹⁴\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,³¹⁵ the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,³¹⁶ but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n310.

Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.³¹⁷ For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.³¹⁸ Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.³¹⁹ By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim.³²⁰ These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.³²¹ Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,³²² and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.³²³ The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n317. Technology is enabling sophisticated nongovernmental capabilities and greater transparency in other areas previously dominated by governments as well. Consider, for example, independent efforts to monitor nuclear proliferation.

A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325.

See supra note 125 (discussing confirmations of CrowdStrike's attribution by companies and researchers); see also supra note 96 and accompanying text (discussing other governments' confirmations of the DNC attribution).\nCyberattack Attribution\nattempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.³²⁸ After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,³²⁹ and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.³³⁰ To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.³³¹ But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases\n³²⁸. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n³²⁹. See Kopan, supra note 328.\n³³⁰. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details).\n³³¹. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,³³² but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.³³³ As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n³³². See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n³³³. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nplus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.³³⁴ The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n³³⁴ Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n.",

Law Review\n# The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution\nKristen E. Eichensehr\n# ABSTRACT\nAttribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack. Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government. Another is insurance coverage. Invoking\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 2019) (denying petitions for rehearing en banc).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncoverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military. Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects. The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n4.

But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention. A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks. Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context. This results in a double challenge for\n8. See infra notes 228–229 and accompanying text (discussing the difference between primary and secondary rules).

REV. 1487, 1493 (2017) (highlighting the “substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations”). One of the best treatments of the relationship between attributions and international law is Martha Finnemore &amp; Duncan B. Hollis, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity, EURO. J. INT’L L. (forthcoming 2020) (draft dated Oct. 30, 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347958. Like this Article, Finnemore and Hollis make the point that public attributions (which they call “accusations”) can contribute to the formation of international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n10. Of course, some modifications are necessary. See, e.g., Kristen E. Eichensehr, Cyberwar and International Law Step Zero, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 357, 375–79 (2015) (discussing areas where cyberspecific law of war rules may be needed).\n11. See, e.g., James A. Green, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 INT’L &amp; COMP. L.Q. 163, 164 (2009) (“One of the most pressing and fundamentally overlooked questions relating to the international legal regulation of self-defence is the standard of evidence to be applied in assessing the lawfulness of such a claim.”); Jules Lobel, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 YALE J. INT’L L. 537, 538 (1999) (“Questions involving the standards and mechanisms for assessing complicated factual inquiries are generally not accorded the same treatment given by the legal academy to the more\nCyberattack Attribution\nthose deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing *lex generalis* from the non-cyberspace context is hard to do, and *lex specialis* governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized. At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency, it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have\nabstract issues involved in defining relevant international law standards.”); Marco Roscini, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n. The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F. Manning, *Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation*, 124 HARV. L. REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17]\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling\n14.

See infra Part III.\nCyberattack Attribution\ndefense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19]\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who\n\nAs Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.” In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.\nNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question. When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion. The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks. Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity, but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n20. Lin, supra note 19, at 89.\n21. Id. at 89–90.\n22. For overviews of the technical aspects of attribution, see JOHN S. DAVIS II ET AL., STATELESS ATTRIBUTION: TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CYBERSPACE 9–16 (2017), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2000/RR2081/RAND_RR2081.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UNZ-XK9S]; Lin, supra note 19, at 80–84; and Thomas Rid &amp; Ben Buchanan, Attributing Cyber Attacks, 38 J. STRATEGIC STUD. 4, 14–23 (2015).\n23. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 15 (describing “atomic, behavioural, and computed” indicators of compromise).\n24. See id. at 17–18 (discussing reuse of infrastructure and software as means of attributing attacks).\n25. See id. at 19; see also Lin, supra note 19, at 90 (“[T]he language setting for the keyboard of a particular computer . . . raises the likelihood that a human perpetrator is from a nation in which that language is used.”).\n26. See, e.g., Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 19 (discussing potential use of language indicators in false flag operations). The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia).\nCyberattack Attribution\nMoving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States\nThe practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.[28] The first public accusation by the U.S. government\n27.

Russia is widely believed to have been responsible for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007. After initially appearing to accuse the Russian government based on tracing some of the attacks to \"servers of Russian state authorities,\" Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, Republic of Estonia, Speech in Riigikogu (May 2, 2007) (transcript available at https://www.valitsus.ee/en/news/prime-minister-andrus-ansips-speech-riigikogu [https://perma.cc/9EH8-2VYW]), an Estonian official later stated that while Russian governmental offices' IP addresses were involved in the attacks, \"[t]here is not sufficient\n\ncame in 2014, when the United States accused five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) of hacking U.S. companies to steal intellectual property. Attributions were almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon until 2017, when state-to-state attributions increased significantly.\nThe move to publicly attribute cyberattacks to governments first required improvements in the technical capacity for attribution. In a 2010 Foreign Affairs article, then Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn signaled the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks, writing that “[t]he forensic\nevidence of a governmental role, but it indicates a possibility.” Associated Press, Estonian Links Moscow to Internet Attack, N.Y.

Clapper told Congress that most hackers \"can no longer assume that their activities will remain undetected. Nor can they assume that if detected, they will be able to conceal their identities. Governmental and private sector security professionals have made significant advances in detecting and attributing cyber intrusions.\"37 In September 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) characterized cyberattack attribution as \"difficult but not impossible.\"38\n33.

This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”\nThe United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years. Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal\n[https://perma.cc/D9PZ-D3FD]) (“[T]he increasing number of national security cyber cases . . . reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.”).\n39.

Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals \"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\" including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.[48] In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.[49] The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.[50] Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were \"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack\n48.

In May 2019, the European Union established a cyberspecific sanctions regime that, like the U.S. sanctions regime, permits imposition of travel bans and asset freezes for \"persons or entities that are responsible for cyber-attacks or attempted cyber-attacks, who provide financial, technical or material support for such attacks or who are involved in other ways.\" Press Release, Council of the European Union, Cyber-Attacks: Council Is Now Able to Impose Sanctions (May 17, 2019), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions [https://perma.cc/96S3-WTHM].\n49. Exec. Order No. 13,757, 82 Fed.

Order No. 13,757, supra note 49, at 3 (listing Russian individuals and entities designated).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntargeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51\nThe third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing\n51. North Korea Sanctions Press Release, supra note 48.\n52.

Similarly, DHS and the DNI issued a statement attributing the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Russian government. Often, such attributions-by-press release are the first in a series of U.S. governmental attributions and responsive actions.\nThe U.S. government frequently deploys more than one mechanism to attribute a particular cyberattack, including rolling out different attribution methods over the course of months or even years. For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement, and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later. Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.\nThe attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers. Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n58. Press Release, Fed.

In accusing the Iranian government of involvement in DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions, for example, an indictment came first, and sanctions followed more than a year later.\nThe practice of governmental public attributions broadened significantly in late 2017 and has increased since then. The impetus for the uptick was a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry. In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard. The ransomware encrypted data on infected machines, locking victims out of their files unless they paid $300 in Bitcoin.

Britain started the ball rolling, with a government minister telling the BBC in October 2017 that North Korea was responsible, but declining to explain the evidentiary basis of the attribution.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution\nStates should be substantiated.\" But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.\nSince the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated. Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.\n. *Id.* at 13.\n.

Wright argued, “There is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based.” In 2019, France and the Netherlands endorsed the same position.\nScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states’ divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.

Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors\nGovernments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years. As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.\nIn high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft. Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.\n.

The first U.S. government attribution came in October 2016. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Press Office, supra note 59.\n\nNongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways. First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information. The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.\nSecond, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets, but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people. The closest the United States came to\n. This discussion of differences between governmental and nongovernmental attributions draws from Kristen E.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.[130] For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government.[131] It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.[132]\nThird and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers.

But others have named different governments, including Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\nFinally, the implications of making an attribution differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors. To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state. But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators. The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions. Nongovernmental entities are not responsible for responsive actions and therefore may feel somewhat freer to accuse governments in the first place. Put another way, the pressure on governments to combine the naming-and-shaming of public\n.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.” Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved. In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.\n## C. The Purposes of Attribution\nVery often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.\n Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.” U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order. The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”\nVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election. Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n. See generally Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace, INT’L SECURITY, Winter 2016/2017, at 44, 45 (“Deterrence means dissuading someone from doing something by making them believe that the costs to them will exceed their expected benefit.”); see also, e.g., Keitner, supra note 31, at 210 (identifying deterrence as one purpose of U.S. attributions-by-indictment).\n.

Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n146.

See Indictment, supra note 97, at 4.\n\nExpecting public attributions alone to deter states may be asking too much. But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.[150] Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.[151] Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,[152] though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may\n150.

Ministry of Def., supra note 91 (noting that the government publicized the Russian officers involved in order to \"hamper any further attempts by them to operate internationally\").\n151. A similar micro-level deterrence strategy may be influencing reported U.S. operations to alert individual Russian operatives that the United States is aware of their election interference-related actions. See Julian E. Barnes, U.S. Begins First Cyberoperations Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections, N.Y. TIMES (Oct. 23, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/russian-hacking-usa-cyber-command.html [https://perma.cc/U9B9-Y5ZY] (reporting that U.S. Cyber Command targeted \"individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work,\" and noting that \"anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government's actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions\"); see also supra note 145 and accompanying text (discussing similar operations related to the 2020 election).\n152. Even commentators skeptical of macro-level deterrence acknowledge the potential micro-level deterrent effect of public attributions. See Goldsmith &amp; Williams, supra note 148 (\"The indictments rarely result in prosecution but do expose the alleged wrongdoers publicly, prevent them from traveling and perhaps embarrass them in certain circles. These costs are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyberintruders and their principals surely take them into account\").\nCyberattack Attribution\nbe less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. $^{153}$ The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. $^{154}$ Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. $^{155}$\nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.[156] Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.[157] This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS \"contain[ed] indicators of\n153. See, e.g., Nakashima, supra note 150 (discussing the arrest of a Russian hacker in the Netherlands).\n154. Relatedly, governmental and nongovernmental attributors should consider the likely consequences to individual hackers outed in attributions; the consequences imposed by their national governments may be far worse than any by the attributing entity. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 530-31 (highlighting due process and privacy concerns stemming from attributions to particular individuals).\n155. See, e.g., Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that U.S. indictments \"can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks\"). However, these tactics may backfire. See America's Government Is Putting Foreign Cyber-Spies in the Dock, ECONOMIST (Sept. 13, 2018), https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/13/americas-government-is-putting-foreign-cyber-spies-in-the-dock [https://perma.cc/2CFF-NP7K] (reporting that U.S. government hackers are concerned that U.S. indictments could prompt retaliation, such as arrests of U.S. government hackers).\n156. See, e.g., MARTIN C. LIBICKI, RAND PROJECT AIR FORCE, CYBERDETERRENCE AND CYBERWAR 7 (2009), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG877.pdf [https://perma.cc/3SFQ-EVU4] (\"If deterrence is anything that dissuades an attack, it is usually said to have two components: deterrence by denial (the ability to frustrate the attacks) and deterrence by punishment (the threat of retaliation).\"); Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (\"Classical deterrence theory rested primarily on two main mechanisms: a credible threat of punishment for an action; and denial of gains from an action\").\n157. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 17 (\"[A] public attribution statement may encourage victims or other vulnerable populations to bolster network defenses.\"); Hunt, supra note 38 (explaining the U.K. strategy to accompany public attributions with details about \"how [a cyber intrusion] was done, thereby helping the cyber security industry to develop protective measures\"); MANDIANT, supra note 121, at 6 (explaining publication of the APT1 report that attributed intrusions to China on the grounds that \"we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively\").\n\ncompromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\" and specifically noted that the alert aimed \"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n158. Alert TA18-074A, supra note 57.\n159. But see Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (asserting that \"deterrence by denial . . . is indifferent to attribution\").\n160. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 27, at 75 art. 22 (\"The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\").\n161. See id. at 129 art. 49 para. 1 (\"An injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act.\"); see also Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hung. v. Slovk.), 1997 I.C.J. 7, 55 (Sept. 25) (explaining that for a countermeasure to be lawful \"it must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State\").\n162. See supra notes 144-145 and accompanying text (discussing private attributions).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law. As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part. Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”).\n. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy).\n. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”).\n. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 10.\n\nparty audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.” Translated into the language of customary international law:\n[P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior. In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n. *Id.* at 11–12.\n. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution\n## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION\nAssuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts. The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled. For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred, it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet. In\n171.

CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 19, 21 (2002) (lamenting the lack of “any well-established set of rules governing evidence in international law in general or in the case of self-defence in particular”).\n172. See Green, supra note 11, at 163 (“[T]he evidentiary standards applicable to the law on the use of force, as with international law more generally, remain extremely unclear.”); O’Connell, supra note 171, at 21 (“How much objective evidence is needed before responding with force [in self-defense to an armed attack] is largely an open question.”).\n173. Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), 2003 I.C.J. 161, 233, ¶ 30 (Nov. 6) (separate opinion of Higgins, J.)

See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 166 (noting that the ICJ “has avoided explicitly articulating a general standard with regard to its decisions” and “has employed different standards, depending upon the dispute before it”); Roscini, supra note 11, at 248 (“The\n\nthe 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence. She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.” She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear, noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.” Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”\nThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide. The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.” In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.” Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense\nICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n175.

Such a standard is less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard employed in criminal law, and more than a preponderance of the evidence. In essence, a \"clear and convincing\" standard requires \"the party with the burden of proof . . . [to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"\nScholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice. Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing \"convincing\" or\n. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including \"clear and convincing,\" preponderance, and \"prima facie evidence,\" in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\" is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n. Green, supra note 11, at 167. Michael Schmitt equates the standard to a state's duty to act reasonably. Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"In essence, it obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may \"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n\n'compelling' evidence\" to support forcible responses to terrorist attacks, including bombings of Libya in 1986, Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993, and Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the United States appears to have deployed the clear and convincing standard to justify the use of force in self defense after the 9/11 attacks. In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had \"clear and compelling information\" that Al Qaeda \"had a central role in the attacks.\" The \"clear and compelling\" phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions. It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.\nWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.” For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. If the most serious international offenses, such as\n187. O'Connell, supra note 171, at 25-28; see also Green, supra note 11, at 174.\n188.

But how much lower?\nState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.” The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”\nTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release. Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions. But some in the cybersecurity community publicly\n(Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.” These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based. Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice” ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation. In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n.

The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J. INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within\nCyberattack Attribution\na normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states. States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies. And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course,\nthe bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent . . . to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations. This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward. States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n219. See, e.g., Qihoo 360, The CIA Hacking Group (APT-C-39) Conducts Cyber-Espionage Operation on China's Critical Industries for 11 Years, 360 CORE SECURITY (Mar. 2, 2020), https://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html [https://perma.cc/22FW-SLXS] (accusing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of hacking targets in China). Arguably, Kaspersky has also accused the United States, though not explicitly. See supra note 139 and accompanying text (discussing Kaspersky Lab's attributions to the \"Equation Group,\" widely understood to refer to the NSA); see also Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 41, at 27–28 (speculating about possible reasons for low rates of attribution to the U.S. government).\n220. Even a requirement to provide evidence is not a foolproof deterrent. Evidence can be faked. See, e.g., Bobby Chesney &amp; Danielle Citron, Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security, 107 CALIF. L. REV. 1753 (2019) (discussing the pernicious possible effects of deep fake video and audio recordings).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence. Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be. If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora. Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.” Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n221. See Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (noting that “the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information” to support the attribution).\n222. Cf. Ashley S. Deeks, *Predicting Enemies*, 104 VA. L. REV. 1529, 1589–90 (2018) (urging the United States to be transparent about its legal and policy decisions on military use of algorithms in order to shape the direction of international law in the area).\n223. See infra notes 277–278 and accompanying text (discussing U.N. General Assembly resolutions).\n224. See Kristen Eichensehr, *Risky Business: When Governments Do Not Attribute State-Sponsored Cyberattacks*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL.: NET POLITICS BLOG (Oct. 4, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/risky-business-when-governments-do-not-attribute-state-sponsored-cyberattacks [https://perma.cc/QS6L-V857] (proposing the “cyber CSI effect”).\n\nprosecutors can produce. Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law, but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance. If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n225. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler, Viewing CSI and the Threshold of Guilt: Managing Truth and Justice in Reality and Fiction, 115 YALE L.J. 1050, 1052 (2006) (describing the \"CSI effect\" as occurring when \"people who watch the series develop unrealistic expectations about the type of evidence typically available during trials, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they will have a 'reasonable doubt' about a defendant's guilt\").\n226. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 211, at 130 (noting that assessing the existence of \"a general practice\" for purposes of customary international law \"refers primarily to the practice of States\" and sometimes to \"the practice of international organizations,\" while \"[c]onduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice\" of states). But see id. at 132 (explaining that in some circumstances the conduct of nonstate and noninternational organization entities like corporations \"may have an indirect role in the identification of customary international law, by stimulating or recording the practice and acceptance as law (opinio juris) of States\").\n227. See, e.g., JACK GOLDSMITH, HOOVER INST., CYBERSECURITY TREATIES: A SKEPTICAL VIEW (2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf [https://perma.cc/2DLX-V979] (discussing hurdles, including verification, to cybersecurity treaties).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors. Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to\n228. See H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94 (3d ed., 2012) (explaining that “while primary rules are concerned with the actions that individuals must or must not do, these secondary rules are all concerned with the primary rules themselves” and determine, among other things how violation of primary norms can be “conclusively determined”).\n229. See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility. Secondary rules lay out the general conditions for a State’s responsibility, as well as the consequences of violating a primary rule.”); Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 27, at 31 (distinguishing between the primary rules that “define the content of international obligations, [and] the breach of which gives rise to responsibility,” and “the secondary rules of State responsibility”).\n230. Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf. Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 116, at 636 (making the converse point that currently “[t]he legal uncertainty surrounding the attribution process may also tip the balance, at times, toward maintaining silence and ambiguity concerning cyberoperations”); see also infra note 280 and accompanying text (discussing how the proposed evidentiary standard can level the playing field for provision of evidence).\n\ncomply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.” A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n232. See infra note 304 and accompanying text (discussing a new attribution entity as a way to standardize private attributors’ methodologies).\n233. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE CRIMINAL § 111 (4th ed.); see also U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MANUAL § 9–11.101 (2018), https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.101 [https://perma.cc/GFA5-XDPN] (“[T]he grand jury’s principal function is to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that one or more persons committed a certain Federal offense within the venue of the district court.”).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged. The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”\nThe standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme. The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts. A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action\n234. See ADMIN. OFFICE U.S. COURTS, HANDBOOK FOR FEDERAL GRAND JURORS 5, http://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/jury/jury_handbook_grand_jurors.pdf [https://perma.cc/T47N-6NL2] (last visited May 9, 2020) (“[T]he grand jury is not responsible for determining whether the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but only whether there is sufficient evidence of probable cause to justify bringing the accused to trial.”). If the grand jury returns an indictment, the prosecutor then chooses whether to sign it and proceed with the case, which would ultimately be determined based on the usual criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. See WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 233, § 101 (explaining that prosecutors have “ultimate veto power over a grand jury decision to indict”); U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, supra note 233, § 9-27.200–250 (discussing considerations prosecutors must take into account in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution).\n235.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 231–32 (1983) (discussing probable cause and noting that “probable cause is a fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules”). Although the U.S. indictments are among the most detailed attributions, the ICJ, for its part, has discounted the value of indictments in establishing international legal responsibility in other contexts. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 132, § 217 (Feb. 26) (explaining that because “the claims made by the Prosecutor in the indictments are just that—allegations made by one party . . . , as a general proposition the inclusion of charges in an indictment cannot be given weight”).\n236.

In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court. For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.” Other governments use the\n238.

See OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN OVERVIEW 2011, at 59–60 (2011) (providing an overview of “estimative language” used by the intelligence community); see also OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, BACKGROUND TO “ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES AND INTENTIONS IN RECENT US ELECTIONS”: THE ANALYTIC PROCESS AND CYBER INCIDENT ATTRIBUTION 2 (2017) [hereinafter BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES], https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf [https://perma.cc/EK3X-58R6] (“Intelligence Community judgments often include two important elements: judgments of how likely it is that something has happened or will happen (using terms such as ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’) and confidence levels in those judgments (low, moderate, and high) that refer to the evidentiary basis, logic and reasoning, and precedents that underpin the judgments.”). ODNI’s Guide to Cyber Attribution defines “high confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of evidence and context to be beyond a reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative,” and defines “moderate confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of the evidence and context to be clear and convincing, with only circumstantial cases for alternatives.” OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, supra note 38, at 4. Despite echoing the language of legal standards, it is not clear that these standards as used by the intelligence community mean the same thing as the same linguistic formulations used in courts. In any event, the intelligence community assessments are not subject to judicial review.\n240. BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES, supra note 239, at 3 (emphasis added).\nCyberattack Attribution\nsame estimative language. Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions. These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act; such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards\n241. See, e.g., Press Release, U.K. Nat'l Cyber Sec. Centre, supra note 95 (noting that the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre \"assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU was almost certainly responsible\" for the 2016 hack of the DNC and subsequent release of stolen documents).\n242. But see Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that cybercrime charges are \"brought only when the facts and law justify\" them and \"we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt\").\n243. See supra note 161 (discussing requirements for countermeasures).\n244. Cf. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 13 (noting that public attributions \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\").\n\nwould not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can. That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law. Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n247. See Eichensehr, supra note 10, at 358 (terming this the “international law step-zero question”); see generally Rebecca Crootof, Regulating New Weapons Technology, in THE IMPACT OF EMERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (Eric Talbot Jensen &amp; Ronald T.P. Alcala eds., forthcoming 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195980 (discussing various factors for determining when new international law is required to regulate new weapons technologies).\nCyberattack Attribution\nFor the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard. For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis. The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n248. See supra notes 173–190 and accompanying text.\n249. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 129, ♦ 209 (Feb. 26) (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n250. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 82. Ultimately, the Manual takes a very on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach. After suggesting that the graver the attack the more evidence will be required, the Manual then notes essentially the opposite logic: states facing severe cyberattacks may be less able to muster robust attribution evidence than states facing less significant attacks. Id.\n251. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81 (“With respect to ex ante uncertainty as to the attribution of cyber operations, . . . States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.”); Egan, supra note 112.\n\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility. Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts, including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante, and accountability for decisions ex post.\nThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may\n252. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 28 (arguing that when details about attribution “are made public, the quality of the attribution is likely to increase” and that publication “may generate new evidence and analysis”).\n253. See generally Frederick Schauer, Giving Reasons, 47 STAN. L. REV. 633, 657 (1995) (discussing the “decision-disciplining function of giving reasons”).\n254.

Sunstein, On the Costs and Benefits of Aggressive Judicial Review of Agency Action, 1989 DUKE L.J. 522, 527 (arguing that the “in terroram effect of the prospect of judicial scrutiny” “serves as a powerful ex ante deterrent to lawless or irrational agency behavior”).\n255.

REV. 99, 115 (2008) (“[T]he fundamental value of reason giving is political and legal accountability”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nor may not choose to undertake, unlike the sliding scale approach from the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, which alters the evidence required based on the severity of the attack or anticipated response. The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259]\n256. See supra notes 121–125 and accompanying text.\n257. See Nakashima, supra note 125 (discussing confirmations by Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect).\n258. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 27–28 (describing the 2014 PLA indictment as “exceptionally detailed” despite the fact that it contained “very few forensic details” as compared to the Mandiant APT1 report on the same actors).\n259. See, e.g., Alert TA17–132A, supra note 53 (providing indicators of compromise related to WannaCry and noting that the alert was updated after the U.S. government attributed WannaCry to North Korea); see also Alert TA18–074A, supra note 57 (providing indicators of compromise and other technical details related to Russian government targeting of various critical infrastructure sectors). Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See\n\nDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations. Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true. Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures. For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution—\nROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n. See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution\nand thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above. Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable\n264. See supra text accompanying note 245 (discussing how domestic law provides an evidentiary floor for some mechanisms used to attribute cyberattacks to states).\n265. See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability.\n\ncrosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n266. For discussions of, for example, whether election interference violates the prohibition on intervention, see Ryan Goodman, International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference, JUST SECURITY (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www.justsecurity.org/35999/international-law-response-russian-election-interference [https://perma.cc/M4P3-A58L], and Duncan Hollis, Russia and the DNC Hack: What Future for a Duty of Non-Intervention?, OPINIJOURIS (July 25, 2016), http://opiniojuris.org/2016/07/25/russia-and-the-dnc-hack-a-violation-of-the-duty-of-non-intervention [https://perma.cc/WAP8-7TNZ].\n267. See supra notes 160-161 and accompanying text (discussing countermeasures).\nCyberattack Attribution\ninternational law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law. In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above, setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward. Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration. Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n269. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text.\n270. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text (discussing the iterative process of norm-creation through attributions).\n271. This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace. See Elaine Korzak, *UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?*, DIPLOMAT (July 31, 2017), https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe [https://perma.cc/29T4-QMXK] (discussing disagreement in the 2017 GGE over international law). In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n272. See, e.g., supra notes 258–259 and accompanying text (discussing technical details and government attributions).\n\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation. That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.” States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.” Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance. This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard. Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing\n273. See supra notes 208–211 and accompanying text.\n274. Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 211, at 141.\n275. Id. at 139.\n276. The proposed customary international law rule would instantiate several of the features that Laurence Helfer and Ingrid Wuerth suggest make the formation of custom more likely, including having “powerful states (or groups of like-min[d]ed countries) advance new rules that respond to emerging global problems or seek to overcome distributional differences by promoting rules with compelling normative content.” Helfer &amp; Wuerth, supra note 216, at 609.\n277.

General Assembly resolutions generally require the vote of a “majority of the members present and voting.” U.N.G.A.R.P 85–86, https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml [https://perma.cc/A5ND-DG38] (defining the voting rules).\nCyberattack Attribution\nthe existence of *opinio juris* for a broad range of states. States could also participate in one of the two ongoing U.N. groups devoted to developing international norms for cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts—both of which may issue reports relevant to customary international law.\nTaken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and *opinio juris* reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed. Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard\n278. See Int'l Law Comm'n, *supra* note 211, at 147–48 (discussing the role of resolutions of international organizations in constituting and reflecting international law, and noting that U.N.

If the accuser has a record of veracity and has technical capacity for sophisticated forensics and good intelligence, accusations with less detail may still be widely credible”).\n\npractice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.\n***\nThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary *lex specialis*, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law. Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n281. Cf. infra note 304 and accompanying text (noting private attributors’ divergences in methodology).\n282. See, e.g., Christine Chinkin, *Normative Development in the International Legal System*, in *COMMITMENT AND COMPLIANCE: THE ROLE OF NON-BINDING NORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM* 21, 30 (Dinah Shelton ed., 2003) (identifying “[e]mergent hard law” as “principles that are first formulated in non-binding form with the possibility, or even aspiration,” that they will “harden into binding custom through the development of state practice and *opinio juris*” (footnotes omitted)).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntankers and shooting down a U.S. drone. The potential for *lex specialis* to transform into *lex generalis* raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.\nThe next Part turns from the legal standard for cyberattack attributions to questions of institutional design.\n## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.\n283. See, e.g., Jasmin Johurun Nessa, *Self-Defense in International Law: What Level of Evidence?*, JUST SECURITY (July 8, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/64796/self-defense-in-international-law-what-level-of-evidence [https://perma.cc/QLD9-7MX5] (discussing the Iran examples and debates about the standard of evidence required for self defense).\n284. JASON HEALEY ET AL., ATLANTIC COUNCIL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN CYBERSPACE: A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY 10 (2014),\n\nThe Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.” The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,” and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.\nAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors. Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.” Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish. Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.” The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”\nAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal. RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n285.

Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.[300] Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.[301] An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often\n294.

For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.” Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.” It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”\nFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.” This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities. An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them. This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n302. Id. at 20.\n303. Id. at 19.\n304.

HEALEY ET AL., supra note 284, at 10 (noting that the proposed Council “can help raise the expected attribution for states with lower attribution capacity by leveraging that of advanced cyber powers”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309]\nA new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some\n308.

This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them). An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution. But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions, the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them, but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n310. In a future project, I plan to address how best to structure an international entity to minimize the risks identified here and to maximize the beneficial role such an entity could play in a decentralized attribution system.\n311.

REV. 1061, 1085 (2008) (explaining epistemic deference in the context of courts and noting that “courts defer to other institutions when they believe that those institutions know more than the courts do about some set of issues, such that it makes sense to allow the views of the knowledgeable authority to substitute for the courts’ own judgment”).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nSecond, decentralization can foster transparency about states' actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors. For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers. Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016. By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim. These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election. Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months, and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018. The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n317. Technology is enabling sophisticated nongovernmental capabilities and greater transparency in other areas previously dominated by governments as well. Consider, for example, independent efforts to monitor nuclear proliferation.

Indictment, supra note 65.\n\nattribution campaign in October 2018. $^{324}$  If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325. See Finkle, supra note 135 (discussing public praise for Mandiant's APT1 report).\n326. See supra notes 130-132.\n327. See supra note 125 (discussing confirmations of CrowdStrike's attribution by companies and researchers); see also supra note 96 and accompanying text (discussing other governments' confirmations of the DNC attribution).\nCyberattack Attribution\nattempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack. After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible, and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case. To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions. But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases\n. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n. See Kopan, supra note 328.\n. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details).\n. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach, but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions. As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nplus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc. The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n.",

Law Review\n# The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution\nKristen E. Eichensehr\n# ABSTRACT\nAttribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION 587\nCONCLUSION 597\n\n# INTRODUCTION\nFiguring out who's doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack. Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government. Another is insurance coverage. Invoking\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 2019) (denying petitions for rehearing en banc).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncoverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military. Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects. The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n4.

But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention. A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks. Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context. This results in a double challenge for\n8. See infra notes 228–229 and accompanying text (discussing the difference between primary and secondary rules).

See, e.g., William Banks, State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0, 95 TEX. L. REV. 1487, 1493 (2017) (highlighting the “substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations”). One of the best treatments of the relationship between attributions and international law is Martha Finnemore &amp; Duncan B. Hollis, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity, EURO. J. INT’L L. (forthcoming 2020) (draft dated Oct. 30, 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347958. Like this Article, Finnemore and Hollis make the point that public attributions (which they call “accusations”) can contribute to the formation of international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n10. Of course, some modifications are necessary. See, e.g., Kristen E. Eichensehr, Cyberwar and International Law Step Zero, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 357, 375–79 (2015) (discussing areas where cyberspecific law of war rules may be needed).\n11. See, e.g., James A. Green, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 INT’L &amp; COMP. L.Q. 163, 164 (2009) (“One of the most pressing and fundamentally overlooked questions relating to the international legal regulation of self-defence is the standard of evidence to be applied in assessing the lawfulness of such a claim.”); Jules Lobel, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 YALE J.

At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency, it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have\nabstract issues involved in defining relevant international law standards.”); Marco Roscini, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n. The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F. Manning, *Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation*, 124 HARV. L. REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17]\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling\n14. See infra Subpart II.B.1.\n15. See infra notes 233–238 and accompanying text.\n16. See infra notes 239–245 and accompanying text.\n17. See infra text accompanying note 245.\n18. See infra Part III.\nCyberattack Attribution\ndefense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19]\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who\n\nAs Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.” In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.\nNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question. When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion. The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks. Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity, but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n20. Lin, supra note 19, at 89.\n21. Id. at 89–90.\n22. For overviews of the technical aspects of attribution, see JOHN S. DAVIS II ET AL., STATELESS ATTRIBUTION: TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CYBERSPACE 9–16 (2017), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2000/RR2081/RAND_RR2081.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UNZ-XK9S]; Lin, supra note 19, at 80–84; and Thomas Rid &amp; Ben Buchanan, Attributing Cyber Attacks, 38 J. STRATEGIC STUD. 4, 14–23 (2015).\n23. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 15 (describing “atomic, behavioural, and computed” indicators of compromise).\n24. See id. at 17–18 (discussing reuse of infrastructure and software as means of attributing attacks).\n25. See id. at 19; see also Lin, supra note 19, at 90 (“[T]he language setting for the keyboard of a particular computer . . . raises the likelihood that a human perpetrator is from a nation in which that language is used.”).\n26. See, e.g., Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 19 (discussing potential use of language indicators in false flag operations). The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia).\nCyberattack Attribution\nMoving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States\nThe practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.[28] The first public accusation by the U.S. government\n27.

Georgian officials have similarly suggested Russian government involvement in DDoS attacks on Georgia in 2008.

In a 2012 speech, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained that over the prior two years, the Defense Department had \"made significant advances\" in attributing cyberattacks.35 He warned, \"[p]otential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.\"36 In 2015, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper told Congress that most hackers \"can no longer assume that their activities will remain undetected. Nor can they assume that if detected, they will be able to conceal their identities. Governmental and private sector security professionals have made significant advances in detecting and attributing cyber intrusions.\"37 In September 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) characterized cyberattack attribution as \"difficult but not impossible.\"38\n33.

This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”\nThe United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years. Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal\n[https://perma.cc/D9PZ-D3FD]) (“[T]he increasing number of national security cyber cases . . . reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.”).\n39.

Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals \"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\" including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.[48] In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.[49] The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.[50] Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were \"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack\n48. Exec. Order No. 13,694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077, 18,077-78 (Apr. 2, 2015). Sanctions under the Executive Order do not depend on foreign government involvement; the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions for routine cybercrime issues as well. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Sanctions Two Individuals for Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities (Dec. 29, 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0693.aspx [https://perma.cc/C2CB-SP6N] (detailing sanctions against two Russians for distribution of malware and associated theft of information). The Treasury Department has also used country-specific sanctions regimes to attribute cyberattacks to foreign governments. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Imposes Sanctions Against the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Jan. 2, 2015), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl9733.aspx [https://perma.cc/8BWT-LMTP] [hereinafter North Korea Sanctions Press Release] (detailing sanctions imposed against North Korean government and related entities for the hack of Sony Pictures). In May 2019, the European Union established a cyberspecific sanctions regime that, like the U.S. sanctions regime, permits imposition of travel bans and asset freezes for \"persons or entities that are responsible for cyber-attacks or attempted cyber-attacks, who provide financial, technical or material support for such attacks or who are involved in other ways.\" Press Release, Council of the European Union, Cyber-Attacks: Council Is Now Able to Impose Sanctions (May 17, 2019), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions [https://perma.cc/96S3-WTHM].\n49.

Order No. 13,757, supra note 49, at 3 (listing Russian individuals and entities designated).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntargeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51\nThe third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing\n51. North Korea Sanctions Press Release, supra note 48.\n52.

Similarly, DHS and the DNI issued a statement attributing the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Russian government. Often, such attributions-by-press release are the first in a series of U.S. governmental attributions and responsive actions.\nThe U.S. government frequently deploys more than one mechanism to attribute a particular cyberattack, including rolling out different attribution methods over the course of months or even years. For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement, and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later. Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.\nThe attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers. Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n58. Press Release, Fed.

In accusing the Iranian government of involvement in DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions, for example, an indictment came first, and sanctions followed more than a year later.\nThe practice of governmental public attributions broadened significantly in late 2017 and has increased since then. The impetus for the uptick was a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry. In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution\nStates should be substantiated.\" But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.\nSince the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated. Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.\n. *Id.* at 13.\n.

Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors\nGovernments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years. As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.\nIn high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft. Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.\n.

The first U.S. government attribution came in October 2016. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Press Office, supra note 59.\n\nNongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways. First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information. The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.\nSecond, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets, but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people. The closest the United States came to\n. This discussion of differences between governmental and nongovernmental attributions draws from Kristen E.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.[130] For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government.[131] It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.[132]\nThird and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers. Many of the attributions focus on the same countries that governmental attributions do, namely China, Iran, North\ngovernment background check, as well as 1.8 million others, including their spouses and friends\").\n128.

But others have named different governments, including Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\nFinally, the implications of making an attribution differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors. To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state. But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators. The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions. Nongovernmental entities are not responsible for responsive actions and therefore may feel somewhat freer to accuse governments in the first place. Put another way, the pressure on governments to combine the naming-and-shaming of public\n.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.” Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved. In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.\n## C. The Purposes of Attribution\nVery often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.\n Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

Sanger, *U.S. Embedded Spyware Overseas, Report Claims*, N.Y.

The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.” U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order. The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”\nVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election. Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n. See generally Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace, INT’L SECURITY, Winter 2016/2017, at 44, 45 (“Deterrence means dissuading someone from doing something by making them believe that the costs to them will exceed their expected benefit.”); see also, e.g., Keitner, supra note 31, at 210 (identifying deterrence as one purpose of U.S. attributions-by-indictment).\n.

POST (Dec. 25, 2019),\nCyberattack Attribution\nMeasuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n146.

See Indictment, supra note 97, at 4.\n\nExpecting public attributions alone to deter states may be asking too much. But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.[150] Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.[151] Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,[152] though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may\n150.

Ministry of Def., supra note 91 (noting that the government publicized the Russian officers involved in order to \"hamper any further attempts by them to operate internationally\").\n151. A similar micro-level deterrence strategy may be influencing reported U.S. operations to alert individual Russian operatives that the United States is aware of their election interference-related actions. See Julian E. Barnes, U.S. Begins First Cyberoperations Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections, N.Y. TIMES (Oct. 23, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/russian-hacking-usa-cyber-command.html [https://perma.cc/U9B9-Y5ZY] (reporting that U.S. Cyber Command targeted \"individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work,\" and noting that \"anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government's actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions\"); see also supra note 145 and accompanying text (discussing similar operations related to the 2020 election).\n152. Even commentators skeptical of macro-level deterrence acknowledge the potential micro-level deterrent effect of public attributions. See Goldsmith &amp; Williams, supra note 148 (\"The indictments rarely result in prosecution but do expose the alleged wrongdoers publicly, prevent them from traveling and perhaps embarrass them in certain circles. These costs are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyberintruders and their principals surely take them into account\").\nCyberattack Attribution\nbe less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. $^{153}$ The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. $^{154}$ Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. $^{155}$\nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.[156] Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.[157] This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS \"contain[ed] indicators of\n153. See, e.g., Nakashima, supra note 150 (discussing the arrest of a Russian hacker in the Netherlands).\n154. Relatedly, governmental and nongovernmental attributors should consider the likely consequences to individual hackers outed in attributions; the consequences imposed by their national governments may be far worse than any by the attributing entity. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 530-31 (highlighting due process and privacy concerns stemming from attributions to particular individuals).\n155. See, e.g., Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that U.S. indictments \"can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks\"). However, these tactics may backfire. See America's Government Is Putting Foreign Cyber-Spies in the Dock, ECONOMIST (Sept. 13, 2018), https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/13/americas-government-is-putting-foreign-cyber-spies-in-the-dock [https://perma.cc/2CFF-NP7K] (reporting that U.S. government hackers are concerned that U.S. indictments could prompt retaliation, such as arrests of U.S. government hackers).\n156. See, e.g., MARTIN C. LIBICKI, RAND PROJECT AIR FORCE, CYBERDETERRENCE AND CYBERWAR 7 (2009), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG877.pdf [https://perma.cc/3SFQ-EVU4] (\"If deterrence is anything that dissuades an attack, it is usually said to have two components: deterrence by denial (the ability to frustrate the attacks) and deterrence by punishment (the threat of retaliation).\"); Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (\"Classical deterrence theory rested primarily on two main mechanisms: a credible threat of punishment for an action; and denial of gains from an action\").\n157. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 17 (\"[A] public attribution statement may encourage victims or other vulnerable populations to bolster network defenses.\"); Hunt, supra note 38 (explaining the U.K. strategy to accompany public attributions with details about \"how [a cyber intrusion] was done, thereby helping the cyber security industry to develop protective measures\"); MANDIANT, supra note 121, at 6 (explaining publication of the APT1 report that attributed intrusions to China on the grounds that \"we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively\").\n\ncompromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\" and specifically noted that the alert aimed \"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n158. Alert TA18-074A, supra note 57.\n159.

See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 27, at 75 art. 22 (\"The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\").\n161.

See supra notes 144-145 and accompanying text (discussing private attributions).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law. As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part. Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”).\n. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy).\n. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”).\n. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 10.\n\nparty audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.” Translated into the language of customary international law:\n[P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior. In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n. *Id.* at 11–12.\n. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution\n## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION\nAssuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts. The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled. For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred, it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet. In\n171. Green, supra note 11, at 165 (“[I]nternational law does not have a clear benchmark against which the persuasiveness or reliability of evidence may be gauged for the purposes of attributing responsibility or assessing legal claims.”); Mary Ellen O’Connell, Evidence of Terror, 7 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 19, 21 (2002) (lamenting the lack of “any well-established set of rules governing evidence in international law in general or in the case of self-defence in particular”).\n172. See Green, supra note 11, at 163 (“[T]he evidentiary standards applicable to the law on the use of force, as with international law more generally, remain extremely unclear.”); O’Connell, supra note 171, at 21 (“How much objective evidence is needed before responding with force [in self-defense to an armed attack] is largely an open question.”).\n173. Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), 2003 I.C.J. 161, 233, ¶ 30 (Nov. 6) (separate opinion of Higgins, J.) (“That a litigant seeking to establish a fact bears the burden of proving it is a commonplace, well-established in the Court’s jurisprudence.” (internal citation omitted)).\n174. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 166 (noting that the ICJ “has avoided explicitly articulating a general standard with regard to its decisions” and “has employed different standards, depending upon the dispute before it”); Roscini, supra note 11, at 248 (“The\n\nthe 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence. She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.” She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear, noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.” Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”\nThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide. The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.” In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.” Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense\nICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n175.

Such a standard is less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard employed in criminal law, and more than a preponderance of the evidence. In essence, a \"clear and convincing\" standard requires \"the party with the burden of proof . . . [to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"\nScholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice. Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing \"convincing\" or\n. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including \"clear and convincing,\" preponderance, and \"prima facie evidence,\" in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\" is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n. Green, supra note 11, at 167. Michael Schmitt equates the standard to a state's duty to act reasonably. Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"In essence, it obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may \"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n\n'compelling' evidence\" to support forcible responses to terrorist attacks, including bombings of Libya in 1986, Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993, and Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the United States appears to have deployed the clear and convincing standard to justify the use of force in self defense after the 9/11 attacks. In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had \"clear and compelling information\" that Al Qaeda \"had a central role in the attacks.\" The \"clear and compelling\" phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions. It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.\nWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.” For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. If the most serious international offenses, such as\n187. O'Connell, supra note 171, at 25-28; see also Green, supra note 11, at 174.\n188.

But how much lower?\nState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.” The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”\nTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release. Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions. But some in the cybersecurity community publicly\n(Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.” These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based. Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice” ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation. In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n.

The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J. INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within\nCyberattack Attribution\na normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states. States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies. And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course,\nthe bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent . . . to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations. This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward. States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n219. See, e.g., Qihoo 360, The CIA Hacking Group (APT-C-39) Conducts Cyber-Espionage Operation on China's Critical Industries for 11 Years, 360 CORE SECURITY (Mar. 2, 2020), https://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html [https://perma.cc/22FW-SLXS] (accusing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of hacking targets in China). Arguably, Kaspersky has also accused the United States, though not explicitly. See supra note 139 and accompanying text (discussing Kaspersky Lab's attributions to the \"Equation Group,\" widely understood to refer to the NSA); see also Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 41, at 27–28 (speculating about possible reasons for low rates of attribution to the U.S. government).\n220. Even a requirement to provide evidence is not a foolproof deterrent. Evidence can be faked. See, e.g., Bobby Chesney &amp; Danielle Citron, Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security, 107 CALIF. L. REV. 1753 (2019) (discussing the pernicious possible effects of deep fake video and audio recordings).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence. Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be. If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora. Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.” Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n221. See Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (noting that “the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information” to support the attribution).\n222. Cf. Ashley S. Deeks, *Predicting Enemies*, 104 VA. L. REV. 1529, 1589–90 (2018) (urging the United States to be transparent about its legal and policy decisions on military use of algorithms in order to shape the direction of international law in the area).\n223. See infra notes 277–278 and accompanying text (discussing U.N. General Assembly resolutions).\n224. See Kristen Eichensehr, *Risky Business: When Governments Do Not Attribute State-Sponsored Cyberattacks*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL.: NET POLITICS BLOG (Oct. 4, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/risky-business-when-governments-do-not-attribute-state-sponsored-cyberattacks [https://perma.cc/QS6L-V857] (proposing the “cyber CSI effect”).\n\nprosecutors can produce. Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law, but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance. If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n225. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler, Viewing CSI and the Threshold of Guilt: Managing Truth and Justice in Reality and Fiction, 115 YALE L.J. 1050, 1052 (2006) (describing the \"CSI effect\" as occurring when \"people who watch the series develop unrealistic expectations about the type of evidence typically available during trials, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they will have a 'reasonable doubt' about a defendant's guilt\").\n226. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 211, at 130 (noting that assessing the existence of \"a general practice\" for purposes of customary international law \"refers primarily to the practice of States\" and sometimes to \"the practice of international organizations,\" while \"[c]onduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice\" of states). But see id. at 132 (explaining that in some circumstances the conduct of nonstate and noninternational organization entities like corporations \"may have an indirect role in the identification of customary international law, by stimulating or recording the practice and acceptance as law (opinio juris) of States\").\n227. See, e.g., JACK GOLDSMITH, HOOVER INST., CYBERSECURITY TREATIES: A SKEPTICAL VIEW (2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf [https://perma.cc/2DLX-V979] (discussing hurdles, including verification, to cybersecurity treaties).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors. Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to\n228. See H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94 (3d ed., 2012) (explaining that “while primary rules are concerned with the actions that individuals must or must not do, these secondary rules are all concerned with the primary rules themselves” and determine, among other things how violation of primary norms can be “conclusively determined”).\n229. See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility. Secondary rules lay out the general conditions for a State’s responsibility, as well as the consequences of violating a primary rule.”); Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 27, at 31 (distinguishing between the primary rules that “define the content of international obligations, [and] the breach of which gives rise to responsibility,” and “the secondary rules of State responsibility”).\n230. Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf. Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 116, at 636 (making the converse point that currently “[t]he legal uncertainty surrounding the attribution process may also tip the balance, at times, toward maintaining silence and ambiguity concerning cyberoperations”); see also infra note 280 and accompanying text (discussing how the proposed evidentiary standard can level the playing field for provision of evidence).\n\ncomply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.” A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n232. See infra note 304 and accompanying text (discussing a new attribution entity as a way to standardize private attributors’ methodologies).\n233. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE CRIMINAL § 111 (4th ed.); see also U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MANUAL § 9–11.101 (2018), https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.101 [https://perma.cc/GFA5-XDPN] (“[T]he grand jury’s principal function is to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that one or more persons committed a certain Federal offense within the venue of the district court.”).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged. The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”\nThe standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme. The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts. A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action\n234. See ADMIN. OFFICE U.S. COURTS, HANDBOOK FOR FEDERAL GRAND JURORS 5, http://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/jury/jury_handbook_grand_jurors.pdf [https://perma.cc/T47N-6NL2] (last visited May 9, 2020) (“[T]he grand jury is not responsible for determining whether the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but only whether there is sufficient evidence of probable cause to justify bringing the accused to trial.”). If the grand jury returns an indictment, the prosecutor then chooses whether to sign it and proceed with the case, which would ultimately be determined based on the usual criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. See WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 233, § 101 (explaining that prosecutors have “ultimate veto power over a grand jury decision to indict”); U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, supra note 233, § 9-27.200–250 (discussing considerations prosecutors must take into account in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution).\n235.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 231–32 (1983) (discussing probable cause and noting that “probable cause is a fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules”). Although the U.S. indictments are among the most detailed attributions, the ICJ, for its part, has discounted the value of indictments in establishing international legal responsibility in other contexts. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 132, § 217 (Feb. 26) (explaining that because “the claims made by the Prosecutor in the indictments are just that—allegations made by one party . . . , as a general proposition the inclusion of charges in an indictment cannot be given weight”).\n236.

In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court. For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.” Other governments use the\n238. Zevallos v. Obama, 793 F.3d 106, 112 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 162 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that “if the [Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control]’s actions were not arbitrary and capricious, and were based on substantial evidence, [the court] must affirm” the designation); see also Zevallos, 793 F.3d. at 109–10 (noting that although the case at hand involved the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, the same procedures apply to all designations, including those pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act).\n239. See OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN OVERVIEW 2011, at 59–60 (2011) (providing an overview of “estimative language” used by the intelligence community); see also OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, BACKGROUND TO “ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES AND INTENTIONS IN RECENT US ELECTIONS”: THE ANALYTIC PROCESS AND CYBER INCIDENT ATTRIBUTION 2 (2017) [hereinafter BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES], https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf [https://perma.cc/EK3X-58R6] (“Intelligence Community judgments often include two important elements: judgments of how likely it is that something has happened or will happen (using terms such as ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’) and confidence levels in those judgments (low, moderate, and high) that refer to the evidentiary basis, logic and reasoning, and precedents that underpin the judgments.”). ODNI’s Guide to Cyber Attribution defines “high confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of evidence and context to be beyond a reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative,” and defines “moderate confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of the evidence and context to be clear and convincing, with only circumstantial cases for alternatives.” OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, supra note 38, at 4. Despite echoing the language of legal standards, it is not clear that these standards as used by the intelligence community mean the same thing as the same linguistic formulations used in courts. In any event, the intelligence community assessments are not subject to judicial review.\n240. BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES, supra note 239, at 3 (emphasis added).\nCyberattack Attribution\nsame estimative language. Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions. These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act; such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards\n241. See, e.g., Press Release, U.K. Nat'l Cyber Sec. Centre, supra note 95 (noting that the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre \"assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU was almost certainly responsible\" for the 2016 hack of the DNC and subsequent release of stolen documents).\n242. But see Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that cybercrime charges are \"brought only when the facts and law justify\" them and \"we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt\").\n243. See supra note 161 (discussing requirements for countermeasures).\n244. Cf. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 13 (noting that public attributions \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\").\n\nwould not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can. That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law. Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n247. See Eichensehr, supra note 10, at 358 (terming this the “international law step-zero question”); see generally Rebecca Crootof, Regulating New Weapons Technology, in THE IMPACT OF EMERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (Eric Talbot Jensen &amp; Ronald T.P. Alcala eds., forthcoming 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195980 (discussing various factors for determining when new international law is required to regulate new weapons technologies).\nCyberattack Attribution\nFor the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard. For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis. The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n248. See supra notes 173–190 and accompanying text.\n249. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 129, ♦ 209 (Feb. 26) (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n250. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 82. Ultimately, the Manual takes a very on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach. After suggesting that the graver the attack the more evidence will be required, the Manual then notes essentially the opposite logic: states facing severe cyberattacks may be less able to muster robust attribution evidence than states facing less significant attacks. Id.\n251. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81 (“With respect to ex ante uncertainty as to the attribution of cyber operations, . . . States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.”); Egan, supra note 112.\n\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility. Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts, including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante, and accountability for decisions ex post.\nThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may\n252. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 28 (arguing that when details about attribution “are made public, the quality of the attribution is likely to increase” and that publication “may generate new evidence and analysis”).\n253. See generally Frederick Schauer, Giving Reasons, 47 STAN. L. REV. 633, 657 (1995) (discussing the “decision-disciplining function of giving reasons”).\n254.

The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259]\n256. See supra notes 121–125 and accompanying text.\n257. See Nakashima, supra note 125 (discussing confirmations by Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect).\n258. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 27–28 (describing the 2014 PLA indictment as “exceptionally detailed” despite the fact that it contained “very few forensic details” as compared to the Mandiant APT1 report on the same actors).\n259. See, e.g., Alert TA17–132A, supra note 53 (providing indicators of compromise related to WannaCry and noting that the alert was updated after the U.S. government attributed WannaCry to North Korea); see also Alert TA18–074A, supra note 57 (providing indicators of compromise and other technical details related to Russian government targeting of various critical infrastructure sectors). Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See\n\nDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations. Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true. Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures. For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution—\nROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n. See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution\nand thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above. Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable\n264. See supra text accompanying note 245 (discussing how domestic law provides an evidentiary floor for some mechanisms used to attribute cyberattacks to states).\n265. See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability.\n\ncrosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n266. For discussions of, for example, whether election interference violates the prohibition on intervention, see Ryan Goodman, International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference, JUST SECURITY (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www.justsecurity.org/35999/international-law-response-russian-election-interference [https://perma.cc/M4P3-A58L], and Duncan Hollis, Russia and the DNC Hack: What Future for a Duty of Non-Intervention?, OPINIJOURIS (July 25, 2016), http://opiniojuris.org/2016/07/25/russia-and-the-dnc-hack-a-violation-of-the-duty-of-non-intervention [https://perma.cc/WAP8-7TNZ].\n267. See supra notes 160-161 and accompanying text (discussing countermeasures).\nCyberattack Attribution\ninternational law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law. In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above, setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward. Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration. Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n269. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text.\n270. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text (discussing the iterative process of norm-creation through attributions).\n271. This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace. See Elaine Korzak, *UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?*, DIPLOMAT (July 31, 2017), https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe [https://perma.cc/29T4-QMXK] (discussing disagreement in the 2017 GGE over international law). In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n272. See, e.g., supra notes 258–259 and accompanying text (discussing technical details and government attributions).\n\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation. That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.” States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.” Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance. This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard. Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing\n273. See supra notes 208–211 and accompanying text.\n274. Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 211, at 141.\n275. Id. at 139.\n276. The proposed customary international law rule would instantiate several of the features that Laurence Helfer and Ingrid Wuerth suggest make the formation of custom more likely, including having “powerful states (or groups of like-min[d]ed countries) advance new rules that respond to emerging global problems or seek to overcome distributional differences by promoting rules with compelling normative content.” Helfer &amp; Wuerth, supra note 216, at 609.\n277.

General Assembly resolutions generally require the vote of a “majority of the members present and voting.” U.N.G.A.R.P 85–86, https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml [https://perma.cc/A5ND-DG38] (defining the voting rules).\nCyberattack Attribution\nthe existence of *opinio juris* for a broad range of states. States could also participate in one of the two ongoing U.N. groups devoted to developing international norms for cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts—both of which may issue reports relevant to customary international law.\nTaken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and *opinio juris* reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed. Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard\n278. See Int'l Law Comm'n, *supra* note 211, at 147–48 (discussing the role of resolutions of international organizations in constituting and reflecting international law, and noting that U.N. General Assembly resolutions deserve “[s]pecial attention” because the Assembly is “a plenary organ of the United Nations with virtually universal participation, that may offer important evidence of the collective opinion of its Members”).\n279. *Group of Governmental Experts*, U.N.

See, e.g., Finnemore &amp; Hollis, *supra* note 9, at 19 (“Reputation and credibility matter greatly in the latitude an accuser has in disclosing supporting details when making accusations. If the accuser has a record of veracity and has technical capacity for sophisticated forensics and good intelligence, accusations with less detail may still be widely credible”).\n\npractice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.\n***\nThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary *lex specialis*, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law. Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n281. Cf. infra note 304 and accompanying text (noting private attributors’ divergences in methodology).\n282. See, e.g., Christine Chinkin, *Normative Development in the International Legal System*, in *COMMITMENT AND COMPLIANCE: THE ROLE OF NON-BINDING NORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM* 21, 30 (Dinah Shelton ed., 2003) (identifying “[e]mergent hard law” as “principles that are first formulated in non-binding form with the possibility, or even aspiration,” that they will “harden into binding custom through the development of state practice and *opinio juris*” (footnotes omitted)).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntankers and shooting down a U.S. drone. The potential for *lex specialis* to transform into *lex generalis* raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.\nThe next Part turns from the legal standard for cyberattack attributions to questions of institutional design.\n## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.\n283. See, e.g., Jasmin Johurun Nessa, *Self-Defense in International Law: What Level of Evidence?*, JUST SECURITY (July 8, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/64796/self-defense-in-international-law-what-level-of-evidence [https://perma.cc/QLD9-7MX5] (discussing the Iran examples and debates about the standard of evidence required for self defense).\n284. JASON HEALEY ET AL., ATLANTIC COUNCIL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN CYBERSPACE: A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY 10 (2014),\n\nThe Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.” The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,” and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.\nAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors. Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.” Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish. Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.” The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”\nAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal. RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n285.

Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.[300] Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.[301] An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often\n294.

For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.” Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.” It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”\nFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.” This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities. An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them. This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n302. Id. at 20.\n303. Id. at 19.\n304.

HEALEY ET AL., supra note 284, at 10 (noting that the proposed Council “can help raise the expected attribution for states with lower attribution capacity by leveraging that of advanced cyber powers”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309]\nA new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some\n308.

DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 4 (noting that for some cases, an international attribution entity \"will likely be . . . ill equipped to produce an attribution decision without the insights that government intelligence agencies may be able to provide\").\n\ngovernments out may exacerbate the perception that the entity's attributions are politicized or that its choice of cases to investigate is skewed.\nAll of these challenges suggest that while there is value to creating an entity in some form, it should become an additional participant in the current decentralized attribution system—centralization within decentralization as it were. This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them). An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution. But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions, the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them, but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n310. In a future project, I plan to address how best to structure an international entity to minimize the risks identified here and to maximize the beneficial role such an entity could play in a decentralized attribution system.\n311.

The following arguments in favor of decentralization draw on Eichensehr, supra note 123.\n315. See Guy-Uriel E. Charles, Colored Speech: Cross Burnings, Epistemics, and the Triumph of the Crits?, 93 GEO. L.J. 575, 610 (2005) (“[E]pistemic authority is invoked when one accepts a factual assertion as true because someone else—someone with epistemic authority—says that it is true.”).\n316. Id. at 611 (“[W]hat we know depends upon whom we believe. . . . Whom we believe is a question of epistemic authority.”); cf. Paul Horwitz, Three Faces of Deference, 83 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1061, 1085 (2008) (explaining epistemic deference in the context of courts and noting that “courts defer to other institutions when they believe that those institutions know more than the courts do about some set of issues, such that it makes sense to allow the views of the knowledgeable authority to substitute for the courts’ own judgment”).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nSecond, decentralization can foster transparency about states' actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors. For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers. Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016. By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim. These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election. Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months, and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018. The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n317. Technology is enabling sophisticated nongovernmental capabilities and greater transparency in other areas previously dominated by governments as well. Consider, for example, independent efforts to monitor nuclear proliferation. See Amy Zegart, The Self-Appointed Spies Who Use Google Earth to Sniff Out Nukes, ATLANTIC (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/new-nuclear-sleuths/602878 [https://perma.cc/EWC6-QVEJ] (discussing the work of “17 major groups or players actively tracking illicit nuclear activities” and arguing that despite some risks, “the democratization of nuclear-threat intelligence is likely to be a boon to the cause of nonproliferation”).\n318.

Indictment, supra note 65.\n\nattribution campaign in October 2018. $^{324}$  If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325. See Finkle, supra note 135 (discussing public praise for Mandiant's APT1 report).\n326. See supra notes 130-132.\n327. See supra note 125 (discussing confirmations of CrowdStrike's attribution by companies and researchers); see also supra note 96 and accompanying text (discussing other governments' confirmations of the DNC attribution).\nCyberattack Attribution\nattempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack. After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible, and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case. To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions. But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases\n. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n. See Kopan, supra note 328.\n. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details).\n. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach, but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions. As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nplus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc. The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n.",

Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.¹ Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.² Another is insurance coverage.³ Invoking",
        "3": "Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir.

Cyberattack Attribution coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.⁴ Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline⁵ to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack. Cyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.⁶ The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.

Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).",

Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well. As both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,¹³ it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace. This Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states. First is the interrelationship between law and politics.

INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43. ¹². The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F.

REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”). ¹³. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”). 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) asserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law. The second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17] The third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling",

Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible. # I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION \"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19] See, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) As Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”²⁰ In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.²¹ Nonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶ operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .",

The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia). Cyberattack Attribution Moving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27 While technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve. The following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward. # A.

Cyberattack Attribution States should be substantiated.\"¹⁰⁹ But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.¹¹⁰ Since the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated.¹¹¹ Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall. For their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained: [D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example.

For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft.¹²¹ Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.¹²² ¹¹⁸.

REV. 520 (2020) Nongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways.¹²³ First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information.¹²⁴ The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.¹²⁵ Second, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets,¹²⁶ but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.¹²⁷ The closest the United States came to ¹²³.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.[130] For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government.[131] It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.[132] Third and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers.

Cyberattack Attribution attribution with other responses means that government attributions run a greater risk of escalation than nongovernmental attributions. Notably, not all cybersecurity companies are willing to make public attributions to governments or think such attributions are a good idea. A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”¹³⁷ Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.¹³⁸ In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.¹³⁹ ## C. The Purposes of Attribution Very often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals. ¹³⁷ Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

REV. 520 (2020) One of the most frequently cited purposes of public attributions is macro-level deterrence.¹⁴⁰ The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”¹⁴¹ U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.¹⁴² The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”¹⁴³ Victim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.¹⁴⁴ The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.¹⁴⁵ Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution. ¹⁴⁰.

POST (Dec. 25, 2019), Cyberattack Attribution Measuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149] https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").",

For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit. A third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.

Cyberattack Attribution 557 Such lack of clarity about states' actions is not unique to cyberattacks,¹⁶³ but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.¹⁶⁴ Publicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵ Development of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third ¹⁶³. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret). ¹⁶⁴. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”). ¹⁶⁵.

REV. 520 (2020) party audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.”¹⁶⁸ Translated into the language of customary international law: [P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹ To be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom. Even absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole. The purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part. ¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4. ¹⁶⁹. *Id.* at 11–12. ¹⁷⁰. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace. Cyberattack Attribution ## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION Assuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system. ## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General International law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky. Some support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.

See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\").

That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.¹⁹¹ While the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues.

But how much lower? State practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.”¹⁹⁵ The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”¹⁹⁶ Turning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”²⁰⁸ These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.²⁰⁹ Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”²¹⁰ ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.²¹¹ In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law. ## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution Attribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been affected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”). ²⁰⁸.

REV. 520 (2020) attacked or identify the perpetrator.[212] But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide. # 1. Why Legalize? At least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement. Given that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes",

The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.",

INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within Cyberattack Attribution a normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.²¹⁵ States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.²¹⁶ Relegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.²¹⁷ And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior. To understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established.

For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia). 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) establishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited. From a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.²¹⁸ This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.²¹⁹ States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.²²⁰ Given these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in",
        "218": "Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.",

The most likely explanations do not withstand scrutiny, however, and other incentives should counsel in favor of developing a legal standard. First, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.²²¹ Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods. Second, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.²²² If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.²²³ Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”²²⁴ Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence",

Third, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance.²²⁷ If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states.

Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions. In any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible.

The Insufficiency of Domestic Law Some of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment.

Even if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.²⁴² These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act;²⁴³ such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review. In addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.²⁴⁴ Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace.

REV. 520 (2020) would not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.²⁴⁵ Additionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.²⁴⁶ That is the domain of international law. ## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution The turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.²⁴⁷ Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.

There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.",

Cyberattack Attribution For the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.²⁴⁸ For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.²⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”²⁵⁰ Adopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.²⁵¹ Moreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.",

Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility.²⁵² Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior. Moreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place.

That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. Crosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259]",

Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) Defining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.²⁶⁰ Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.²⁶¹ A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.²⁶² Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard. Adopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution. Consider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures.²⁶³ For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution— ROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election). ²⁶⁰. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)). ²⁶¹. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards). ²⁶². See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”). ²⁶³. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence). Cyberattack Attribution and thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution. Creating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.²⁶⁴ Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial. Finally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.²⁶⁵ If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable",

        "265": "See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability. 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) crosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence. The legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold. Some cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures. For attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve. Importantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate",

And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,²⁶⁹ setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.²⁷⁰ The process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.²⁷¹ Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.²⁷² Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions.

The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.²⁷³ That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”²⁷⁴ States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”²⁷⁵ Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.²⁷⁶ This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law. In addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations.

In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.²⁸⁰ Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues. Although international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well.

REV. 520 (2020) practice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet²⁸¹ and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster. *** The paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary *lex specialis*, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.²⁸² Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law. The proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made.

The next Part turns from the legal standard for cyberattack attributions to questions of institutional design. ## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION Setting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity. This Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization. The problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.²⁸⁴",

Cyberattack Attribution The proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model. First, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world. Second, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309] A new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some",

This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).³¹¹ An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.³¹² But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.³¹³ The decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.³¹⁴ First, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,³¹⁵ the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,³¹⁶ but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed",

Cyberattack Attribution 593 evidentiary standard fosters credibility because of decentralization and the promise of multiple attributors verifying attributions. Second, decentralization can foster transparency about states' actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor. Numerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.³¹⁷ For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.³¹⁸ Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.³¹⁹ By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim.³²⁰ These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.³²¹ Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,³²² and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.³²³ The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated",

REV. 520 (2020) attribution campaign in October 2018. $^{324}$ If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts. Third, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions. Decentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments. Fourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some",

Cyberattack Attribution attempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.³²⁸ After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,³²⁹ and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.³³⁰ To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.³³¹ But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system. Another way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone. Finally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases ³²⁸. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea). ³²⁹. See Kopan, supra note 328. ³³⁰. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details). ³³¹. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12. 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) may be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,³³² but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information. The ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward. All of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.³³³ As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), ³³². See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”). ³³³. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”). Cyberattack Attribution plus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.³³⁴ The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution. Importantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions. ## CONCLUSION Cyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity. ³³⁴ Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”). Improving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict. ."

The statement supported by the broadest range of countries came in a 2015 U.N.

Cyberattack Attribution States should be substantiated.\"¹⁰⁹ But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.¹¹⁰ Since the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated.¹¹¹ Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall. For their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained: [D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.¹¹² ¹⁰⁹. *Id.* at 13. ¹¹⁰.

Law Review\n# The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution\nKristen E. Eichensehr\n# ABSTRACT\nAttribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack. Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government. Another is insurance coverage. Invoking\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C.

Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects. The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n4.

But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention. A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks. Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context. This results in a double challenge for\n8. See infra notes 228–229 and accompanying text (discussing the difference between primary and secondary rules).

REV. 1487, 1493 (2017) (highlighting the “substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations”). One of the best treatments of the relationship between attributions and international law is Martha Finnemore &amp; Duncan B. Hollis, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity, EURO. J. INT’L L. (forthcoming 2020) (draft dated Oct. 30, 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347958. Like this Article, Finnemore and Hollis make the point that public attributions (which they call “accusations”) can contribute to the formation of international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n10. Of course, some modifications are necessary. See, e.g., Kristen E. Eichensehr, Cyberwar and International Law Step Zero, 50 TEX.

At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency, it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have\nabstract issues involved in defining relevant international law standards.”); Marco Roscini, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n. The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F. Manning, *Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation*, 124 HARV. L. REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17]\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling\n14.

See infra Part III.\nCyberattack Attribution\ndefense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19]\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who\n\nAs Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.” In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.\nNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question. When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion. The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks. Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity, but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n20. Lin, supra note 19, at 89.\n21. Id. at 89–90.\n22. For overviews of the technical aspects of attribution, see JOHN S. DAVIS II ET AL., STATELESS ATTRIBUTION: TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CYBERSPACE 9–16 (2017), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2000/RR2081/RAND_RR2081.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UNZ-XK9S]; Lin, supra note 19, at 80–84; and Thomas Rid &amp; Ben Buchanan, Attributing Cyber Attacks, 38 J. STRATEGIC STUD. 4, 14–23 (2015).\n23. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 15 (describing “atomic, behavioural, and computed” indicators of compromise).\n24. See id. at 17–18 (discussing reuse of infrastructure and software as means of attributing attacks).\n25. See id. at 19; see also Lin, supra note 19, at 90 (“[T]he language setting for the keyboard of a particular computer . . . raises the likelihood that a human perpetrator is from a nation in which that language is used.”).\n26. See, e.g., Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 19 (discussing potential use of language indicators in false flag operations). The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia).\nCyberattack Attribution\nMoving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States\nThe practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.[28] The first public accusation by the U.S. government\n27.

Attributions were almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon until 2017, when state-to-state attributions increased significantly.\nThe move to publicly attribute cyberattacks to governments first required improvements in the technical capacity for attribution.

This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”\nThe United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years. Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal\n[https://perma.cc/D9PZ-D3FD]) (“[T]he increasing number of national security cyber cases . . . reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.”).\n39.

Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals \"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\" including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.[48] In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.[49] The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.[50] Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were \"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack\n48. Exec. Order No. 13,694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077, 18,077-78 (Apr. 2, 2015). Sanctions under the Executive Order do not depend on foreign government involvement; the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions for routine cybercrime issues as well. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Sanctions Two Individuals for Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities (Dec. 29, 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0693.aspx [https://perma.cc/C2CB-SP6N] (detailing sanctions against two Russians for distribution of malware and associated theft of information). The Treasury Department has also used country-specific sanctions regimes to attribute cyberattacks to foreign governments. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Imposes Sanctions Against the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Jan. 2, 2015), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl9733.aspx [https://perma.cc/8BWT-LMTP] [hereinafter North Korea Sanctions Press Release] (detailing sanctions imposed against North Korean government and related entities for the hack of Sony Pictures). In May 2019, the European Union established a cyberspecific sanctions regime that, like the U.S. sanctions regime, permits imposition of travel bans and asset freezes for \"persons or entities that are responsible for cyber-attacks or attempted cyber-attacks, who provide financial, technical or material support for such attacks or who are involved in other ways.\" Press Release, Council of the European Union, Cyber-Attacks: Council Is Now Able to Impose Sanctions (May 17, 2019), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions [https://perma.cc/96S3-WTHM].\n49. Exec. Order No. 13,757, 82 Fed. Reg. 1, 1 (Jan. 3, 2017) (adding authority to impose sanctions for \"tampering with, altering, or causing a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions\").\n50.

Order No. 13,757, supra note 49, at 3 (listing Russian individuals and entities designated).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntargeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51\nThe third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing\n51. North Korea Sanctions Press Release, supra note 48.\n52.

Similarly, DHS and the DNI issued a statement attributing the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Russian government. Often, such attributions-by-press release are the first in a series of U.S. governmental attributions and responsive actions.\nThe U.S. government frequently deploys more than one mechanism to attribute a particular cyberattack, including rolling out different attribution methods over the course of months or even years. For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement, and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later. Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.\nThe attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers. Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\n58. Press Release, Fed.

In accusing the Iranian government of involvement in DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions, for example, an indictment came first, and sanctions followed more than a year later.\nThe practice of governmental public attributions broadened significantly in late 2017 and has increased since then. The impetus for the uptick was a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry. In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard. The ransomware encrypted data on infected machines, locking victims out of their files unless they paid $300 in Bitcoin.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution\nStates should be substantiated.\" But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.\nSince the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated. Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.\n. *Id.* at 13.\n.

Wright argued, “There is no legal obligation requiring a state to publicly disclose the underlying information on which its decision to attribute hostile activity is based.” In 2019, France and the Netherlands endorsed the same position.\nScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue. In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states’ divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.

Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors\nGovernments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years. As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.\nIn high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft. Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.\n.

The first U.S. government attribution came in October 2016. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Press Office, supra note 59.\n\nNongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways. First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information. The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.\nSecond, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets, but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.

But others have named different governments, including Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\nFinally, the implications of making an attribution differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors. To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state. But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators. The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions. Nongovernmental entities are not responsible for responsive actions and therefore may feel somewhat freer to accuse governments in the first place.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.” Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved. In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.\n## C. The Purposes of Attribution\nVery often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.\n Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.” U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order. The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”\nVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election. Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n. See generally Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace, INT’L SECURITY, Winter 2016/2017, at 44, 45 (“Deterrence means dissuading someone from doing something by making them believe that the costs to them will exceed their expected benefit.”); see also, e.g., Keitner, supra note 31, at 210 (identifying deterrence as one purpose of U.S. attributions-by-indictment).\n.

POST (Dec. 25, 2019),\nCyberattack Attribution\nMeasuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n146.

See Indictment, supra note 97, at 4.\n\nExpecting public attributions alone to deter states may be asking too much. But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.[150] Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.[151] Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,[152] though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may\n150.

Ministry of Def., supra note 91 (noting that the government publicized the Russian officers involved in order to \"hamper any further attempts by them to operate internationally\").\n151. A similar micro-level deterrence strategy may be influencing reported U.S. operations to alert individual Russian operatives that the United States is aware of their election interference-related actions. See Julian E. Barnes, U.S. Begins First Cyberoperations Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections, N.Y. TIMES (Oct. 23, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/russian-hacking-usa-cyber-command.html [https://perma.cc/U9B9-Y5ZY] (reporting that U.S. Cyber Command targeted \"individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work,\" and noting that \"anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government's actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions\"); see also supra note 145 and accompanying text (discussing similar operations related to the 2020 election).\n152. Even commentators skeptical of macro-level deterrence acknowledge the potential micro-level deterrent effect of public attributions. See Goldsmith &amp; Williams, supra note 148 (\"The indictments rarely result in prosecution but do expose the alleged wrongdoers publicly, prevent them from traveling and perhaps embarrass them in certain circles. These costs are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyberintruders and their principals surely take them into account\").\nCyberattack Attribution\nbe less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. $^{153}$ The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. $^{154}$ Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. $^{155}$\nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.[156] Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.[157] This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS \"contain[ed] indicators of\n153. See, e.g., Nakashima, supra note 150 (discussing the arrest of a Russian hacker in the Netherlands).\n154. Relatedly, governmental and nongovernmental attributors should consider the likely consequences to individual hackers outed in attributions; the consequences imposed by their national governments may be far worse than any by the attributing entity. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 530-31 (highlighting due process and privacy concerns stemming from attributions to particular individuals).\n155. See, e.g., Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that U.S. indictments \"can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks\"). However, these tactics may backfire. See America's Government Is Putting Foreign Cyber-Spies in the Dock, ECONOMIST (Sept. 13, 2018), https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/13/americas-government-is-putting-foreign-cyber-spies-in-the-dock [https://perma.cc/2CFF-NP7K] (reporting that U.S. government hackers are concerned that U.S. indictments could prompt retaliation, such as arrests of U.S. government hackers).\n156.

LIBICKI, RAND PROJECT AIR FORCE, CYBERDETERRENCE AND CYBERWAR 7 (2009), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG877.pdf [https://perma.cc/3SFQ-EVU4] (\"If deterrence is anything that dissuades an attack, it is usually said to have two components: deterrence by denial (the ability to frustrate the attacks) and deterrence by punishment (the threat of retaliation).\"); Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (\"Classical deterrence theory rested primarily on two main mechanisms: a credible threat of punishment for an action; and denial of gains from an action\").\n157. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 17 (\"[A] public attribution statement may encourage victims or other vulnerable populations to bolster network defenses.\"); Hunt, supra note 38 (explaining the U.K. strategy to accompany public attributions with details about \"how [a cyber intrusion] was done, thereby helping the cyber security industry to develop protective measures\"); MANDIANT, supra note 121, at 6 (explaining publication of the APT1 report that attributed intrusions to China on the grounds that \"we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively\").\n\ncompromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\" and specifically noted that the alert aimed \"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n158. Alert TA18-074A, supra note 57.\n159. But see Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (asserting that \"deterrence by denial . . . is indifferent to attribution\").\n160. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 27, at 75 art. 22 (\"The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\").\n161. See id. at 129 art. 49 para. 1 (\"An injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act.\"); see also Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hung. v.

See supra notes 144-145 and accompanying text (discussing private attributions).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law. As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part. Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”).\n. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy).\n. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”).\n. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 10.\n\nparty audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.” Translated into the language of customary international law:\n[P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior. In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n. *Id.* at 11–12.\n. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution\n## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION\nAssuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts. The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled. For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred, it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet. In\n171.

See Green, supra note 11, at 163 (“[T]he evidentiary standards applicable to the law on the use of force, as with international law more generally, remain extremely unclear.”); O’Connell, supra note 171, at 21 (“How much objective evidence is needed before responding with force [in self-defense to an armed attack] is largely an open question.”).\n173. Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), 2003 I.C.J. 161, 233, ¶ 30 (Nov. 6) (separate opinion of Higgins, J.)

See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 166 (noting that the ICJ “has avoided explicitly articulating a general standard with regard to its decisions” and “has employed different standards, depending upon the dispute before it”); Roscini, supra note 11, at 248 (“The\n\nthe 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence. She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.” She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear, noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.” Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”\nThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide. The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.” In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.” Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense\nICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n175.

Such a standard is less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard employed in criminal law, and more than a preponderance of the evidence. In essence, a \"clear and convincing\" standard requires \"the party with the burden of proof . . . [to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"\nScholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice. Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing \"convincing\" or\n. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including \"clear and convincing,\" preponderance, and \"prima facie evidence,\" in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\" is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n. Green, supra note 11, at 167. Michael Schmitt equates the standard to a state's duty to act reasonably. Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"In essence, it obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may \"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n\n'compelling' evidence\" to support forcible responses to terrorist attacks, including bombings of Libya in 1986, Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993, and Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the United States appears to have deployed the clear and convincing standard to justify the use of force in self defense after the 9/11 attacks. In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had \"clear and compelling information\" that Al Qaeda \"had a central role in the attacks.\" The \"clear and compelling\" phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions. It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.\nWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.” For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. If the most serious international offenses, such as\n187. O'Connell, supra note 171, at 25-28; see also Green, supra note 11, at 174.\n188.

But how much lower?\nState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.” The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”\nTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release. Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions. But some in the cybersecurity community publicly\n(Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.” These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based. Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice” ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation. In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n.

The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J. INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within\nCyberattack Attribution\na normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states. States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies. And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course,\nthe bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent . . . to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations. This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward. States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n219.

See supra note 139 and accompanying text (discussing Kaspersky Lab's attributions to the \"Equation Group,\" widely understood to refer to the NSA); see also Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 41, at 27–28 (speculating about possible reasons for low rates of attribution to the U.S. government).\n220. Even a requirement to provide evidence is not a foolproof deterrent. Evidence can be faked. See, e.g., Bobby Chesney &amp; Danielle Citron, Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security, 107 CALIF. L. REV. 1753 (2019) (discussing the pernicious possible effects of deep fake video and audio recordings).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence. Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be. If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora. Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.” Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n221. See Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (noting that “the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information” to support the attribution).\n222. Cf. Ashley S. Deeks, *Predicting Enemies*, 104 VA. L. REV. 1529, 1589–90 (2018) (urging the United States to be transparent about its legal and policy decisions on military use of algorithms in order to shape the direction of international law in the area).\n223. See infra notes 277–278 and accompanying text (discussing U.N. General Assembly resolutions).\n224. See Kristen Eichensehr, *Risky Business: When Governments Do Not Attribute State-Sponsored Cyberattacks*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL.: NET POLITICS BLOG (Oct. 4, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/risky-business-when-governments-do-not-attribute-state-sponsored-cyberattacks [https://perma.cc/QS6L-V857] (proposing the “cyber CSI effect”).\n\nprosecutors can produce. Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law, but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance. If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n225. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler, Viewing CSI and the Threshold of Guilt: Managing Truth and Justice in Reality and Fiction, 115 YALE L.J. 1050, 1052 (2006) (describing the \"CSI effect\" as occurring when \"people who watch the series develop unrealistic expectations about the type of evidence typically available during trials, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they will have a 'reasonable doubt' about a defendant's guilt\").\n226. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 211, at 130 (noting that assessing the existence of \"a general practice\" for purposes of customary international law \"refers primarily to the practice of States\" and sometimes to \"the practice of international organizations,\" while \"[c]onduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice\" of states). But see id. at 132 (explaining that in some circumstances the conduct of nonstate and noninternational organization entities like corporations \"may have an indirect role in the identification of customary international law, by stimulating or recording the practice and acceptance as law (opinio juris) of States\").\n227. See, e.g., JACK GOLDSMITH, HOOVER INST., CYBERSECURITY TREATIES: A SKEPTICAL VIEW (2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf [https://perma.cc/2DLX-V979] (discussing hurdles, including verification, to cybersecurity treaties).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors. Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to\n228. See H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94 (3d ed., 2012) (explaining that “while primary rules are concerned with the actions that individuals must or must not do, these secondary rules are all concerned with the primary rules themselves” and determine, among other things how violation of primary norms can be “conclusively determined”).\n229. See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility. Secondary rules lay out the general conditions for a State’s responsibility, as well as the consequences of violating a primary rule.”); Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 27, at 31 (distinguishing between the primary rules that “define the content of international obligations, [and] the breach of which gives rise to responsibility,” and “the secondary rules of State responsibility”).\n230. Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf. Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 116, at 636 (making the converse point that currently “[t]he legal uncertainty surrounding the attribution process may also tip the balance, at times, toward maintaining silence and ambiguity concerning cyberoperations”); see also infra note 280 and accompanying text (discussing how the proposed evidentiary standard can level the playing field for provision of evidence).\n\ncomply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.” A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n232. See infra note 304 and accompanying text (discussing a new attribution entity as a way to standardize private attributors’ methodologies).\n233. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE CRIMINAL § 111 (4th ed.); see also U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MANUAL § 9–11.101 (2018), https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.101 [https://perma.cc/GFA5-XDPN] (“[T]he grand jury’s principal function is to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that one or more persons committed a certain Federal offense within the venue of the district court.”).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged. The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”\nThe standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme. The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts. A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action\n234. See ADMIN. OFFICE U.S. COURTS, HANDBOOK FOR FEDERAL GRAND JURORS 5, http://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/jury/jury_handbook_grand_jurors.pdf [https://perma.cc/T47N-6NL2] (last visited May 9, 2020) (“[T]he grand jury is not responsible for determining whether the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but only whether there is sufficient evidence of probable cause to justify bringing the accused to trial.”). If the grand jury returns an indictment, the prosecutor then chooses whether to sign it and proceed with the case, which would ultimately be determined based on the usual criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. See WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 233, § 101 (explaining that prosecutors have “ultimate veto power over a grand jury decision to indict”); U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, supra note 233, § 9-27.200–250 (discussing considerations prosecutors must take into account in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution).\n235.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 231–32 (1983) (discussing probable cause and noting that “probable cause is a fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules”). Although the U.S. indictments are among the most detailed attributions, the ICJ, for its part, has discounted the value of indictments in establishing international legal responsibility in other contexts. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 132, § 217 (Feb. 26) (explaining that because “the claims made by the Prosecutor in the indictments are just that—allegations made by one party . . . , as a general proposition the inclusion of charges in an indictment cannot be given weight”).\n236.

In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court. For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.” Other governments use the\n238. Zevallos v. Obama, 793 F.3d 106, 112 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156, 162 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that “if the [Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control]’s actions were not arbitrary and capricious, and were based on substantial evidence, [the court] must affirm” the designation); see also Zevallos, 793 F.3d. at 109–10 (noting that although the case at hand involved the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, the same procedures apply to all designations, including those pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act).\n239. See OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN OVERVIEW 2011, at 59–60 (2011) (providing an overview of “estimative language” used by the intelligence community); see also OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, BACKGROUND TO “ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES AND INTENTIONS IN RECENT US ELECTIONS”: THE ANALYTIC PROCESS AND CYBER INCIDENT ATTRIBUTION 2 (2017) [hereinafter BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES], https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf [https://perma.cc/EK3X-58R6] (“Intelligence Community judgments often include two important elements: judgments of how likely it is that something has happened or will happen (using terms such as ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’) and confidence levels in those judgments (low, moderate, and high) that refer to the evidentiary basis, logic and reasoning, and precedents that underpin the judgments.”). ODNI’s Guide to Cyber Attribution defines “high confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of evidence and context to be beyond a reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative,” and defines “moderate confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of the evidence and context to be clear and convincing, with only circumstantial cases for alternatives.” OFFICE OF THE DIR. OF NAT’L INTELLIGENCE, supra note 38, at 4. Despite echoing the language of legal standards, it is not clear that these standards as used by the intelligence community mean the same thing as the same linguistic formulations used in courts. In any event, the intelligence community assessments are not subject to judicial review.\n240. BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES, supra note 239, at 3 (emphasis added).\nCyberattack Attribution\nsame estimative language. Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions. These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act; such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards\n241. See, e.g., Press Release, U.K. Nat'l Cyber Sec. Centre, supra note 95 (noting that the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre \"assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU was almost certainly responsible\" for the 2016 hack of the DNC and subsequent release of stolen documents).\n242. But see Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that cybercrime charges are \"brought only when the facts and law justify\" them and \"we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt\").\n243. See supra note 161 (discussing requirements for countermeasures).\n244. Cf. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 13 (noting that public attributions \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\").\n\nwould not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.\nAdditionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can. That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law. Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n247. See Eichensehr, supra note 10, at 358 (terming this the “international law step-zero question”); see generally Rebecca Crootof, Regulating New Weapons Technology, in THE IMPACT OF EMERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (Eric Talbot Jensen &amp; Ronald T.P. Alcala eds., forthcoming 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195980 (discussing various factors for determining when new international law is required to regulate new weapons technologies).\nCyberattack Attribution\nFor the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard. For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis. The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n248. See supra notes 173–190 and accompanying text.\n249. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 129, ♦ 209 (Feb. 26) (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n250. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 82. Ultimately, the Manual takes a very on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach. After suggesting that the graver the attack the more evidence will be required, the Manual then notes essentially the opposite logic: states facing severe cyberattacks may be less able to muster robust attribution evidence than states facing less significant attacks. Id.\n251. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81 (“With respect to ex ante uncertainty as to the attribution of cyber operations, . . . States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.”); Egan, supra note 112.\n\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility. Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts, including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante, and accountability for decisions ex post.\nThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may\n252. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 28 (arguing that when details about attribution “are made public, the quality of the attribution is likely to increase” and that publication “may generate new evidence and analysis”).\n253. See generally Frederick Schauer, Giving Reasons, 47 STAN. L. REV. 633, 657 (1995) (discussing the “decision-disciplining function of giving reasons”).\n254. See, e.g., Martin Shapiro, The Giving Reasons Requirement, 1992 U. CHI.

Sunstein, On the Costs and Benefits of Aggressive Judicial Review of Agency Action, 1989 DUKE L.J. 522, 527 (arguing that the “in terroram effect of the prospect of judicial scrutiny” “serves as a powerful ex ante deterrent to lawless or irrational agency behavior”).\n255.

REV. 99, 115 (2008) (“[T]he fundamental value of reason giving is political and legal accountability”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nor may not choose to undertake, unlike the sliding scale approach from the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, which alters the evidence required based on the severity of the attack or anticipated response. The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259]\n256. See supra notes 121–125 and accompanying text.\n257. See Nakashima, supra note 125 (discussing confirmations by Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect).\n258. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 27–28 (describing the 2014 PLA indictment as “exceptionally detailed” despite the fact that it contained “very few forensic details” as compared to the Mandiant APT1 report on the same actors).\n259. See, e.g., Alert TA17–132A, supra note 53 (providing indicators of compromise related to WannaCry and noting that the alert was updated after the U.S. government attributed WannaCry to North Korea); see also Alert TA18–074A, supra note 57 (providing indicators of compromise and other technical details related to Russian government targeting of various critical infrastructure sectors). Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See\n\nDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations. Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true. Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures. For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution—\nROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n. See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution\nand thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above. Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable\n264. See supra text accompanying note 245 (discussing how domestic law provides an evidentiary floor for some mechanisms used to attribute cyberattacks to states).\n265. See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability.\n\ncrosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n266. For discussions of, for example, whether election interference violates the prohibition on intervention, see Ryan Goodman, International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference, JUST SECURITY (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www.justsecurity.org/35999/international-law-response-russian-election-interference [https://perma.cc/M4P3-A58L], and Duncan Hollis, Russia and the DNC Hack: What Future for a Duty of Non-Intervention?, OPINIJOURIS (July 25, 2016), http://opiniojuris.org/2016/07/25/russia-and-the-dnc-hack-a-violation-of-the-duty-of-non-intervention [https://perma.cc/WAP8-7TNZ].\n267. See supra notes 160-161 and accompanying text (discussing countermeasures).\nCyberattack Attribution\ninternational law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law. In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above, setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward. Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration. Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n269. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text.\n270. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text (discussing the iterative process of norm-creation through attributions).\n271. This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace. See Elaine Korzak, *UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?*, DIPLOMAT (July 31, 2017), https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe [https://perma.cc/29T4-QMXK] (discussing disagreement in the 2017 GGE over international law). In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n272. See, e.g., supra notes 258–259 and accompanying text (discussing technical details and government attributions).\n\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation. That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.” States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.” Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance. This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard. Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing\n273. See supra notes 208–211 and accompanying text.\n274. Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 211, at 141.\n275. Id. at 139.\n276. The proposed customary international law rule would instantiate several of the features that Laurence Helfer and Ingrid Wuerth suggest make the formation of custom more likely, including having “powerful states (or groups of like-min[d]ed countries) advance new rules that respond to emerging global problems or seek to overcome distributional differences by promoting rules with compelling normative content.” Helfer &amp; Wuerth, supra note 216, at 609.\n277. U.N. General Assembly resolutions generally require the vote of a “majority of the members present and voting.” U.N.G.A.R.P 85–86, https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/plenary.shtml [https://perma.cc/A5ND-DG38] (defining the voting rules).\nCyberattack Attribution\nthe existence of *opinio juris* for a broad range of states. States could also participate in one of the two ongoing U.N. groups devoted to developing international norms for cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts—both of which may issue reports relevant to customary international law.\nTaken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and *opinio juris* reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed. Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard\n278. See Int'l Law Comm'n, *supra* note 211, at 147–48 (discussing the role of resolutions of international organizations in constituting and reflecting international law, and noting that U.N. General Assembly resolutions deserve “[s]pecial attention” because the Assembly is “a plenary organ of the United Nations with virtually universal participation, that may offer important evidence of the collective opinion of its Members”).\n279. *Group of Governmental Experts*, U.N.

Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law. Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n281. Cf. infra note 304 and accompanying text (noting private attributors’ divergences in methodology).\n282. See, e.g., Christine Chinkin, *Normative Development in the International Legal System*, in *COMMITMENT AND COMPLIANCE: THE ROLE OF NON-BINDING NORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM* 21, 30 (Dinah Shelton ed., 2003) (identifying “[e]mergent hard law” as “principles that are first formulated in non-binding form with the possibility, or even aspiration,” that they will “harden into binding custom through the development of state practice and *opinio juris*” (footnotes omitted)).\nCyberattack Attribution\ntankers and shooting down a U.S. drone. The potential for *lex specialis* to transform into *lex generalis* raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.\nThe next Part turns from the legal standard for cyberattack attributions to questions of institutional design.\n## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.\n283. See, e.g., Jasmin Johurun Nessa, *Self-Defense in International Law: What Level of Evidence?*, JUST SECURITY (July 8, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/64796/self-defense-in-international-law-what-level-of-evidence [https://perma.cc/QLD9-7MX5] (discussing the Iran examples and debates about the standard of evidence required for self defense).\n284. JASON HEALEY ET AL., ATLANTIC COUNCIL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN CYBERSPACE: A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY 10 (2014),\n\nThe Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.” The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,” and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.\nAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors. Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.” Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish. Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.” The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”\nAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal. RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n285.

Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.[300] Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.[301] An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often\n294.

For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.” Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.” It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”\nFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.” This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities. An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them. This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n302. Id. at 20.\n303. Id. at 19.\n304.

At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309]\nA new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some\n308.

This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them). An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution. But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions, the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them, but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n310.

REV. 1061, 1085 (2008) (explaining epistemic deference in the context of courts and noting that “courts defer to other institutions when they believe that those institutions know more than the courts do about some set of issues, such that it makes sense to allow the views of the knowledgeable authority to substitute for the courts’ own judgment”).\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nSecond, decentralization can foster transparency about states' actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors. For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers. Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016. By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim. These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election. Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months, and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018. The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n317. Technology is enabling sophisticated nongovernmental capabilities and greater transparency in other areas previously dominated by governments as well. Consider, for example, independent efforts to monitor nuclear proliferation. See Amy Zegart, The Self-Appointed Spies Who Use Google Earth to Sniff Out Nukes, ATLANTIC (Dec. 6, 2019), https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/new-nuclear-sleuths/602878 [https://perma.cc/EWC6-QVEJ] (discussing the work of “17 major groups or players actively tracking illicit nuclear activities” and arguing that despite some risks, “the democratization of nuclear-threat intelligence is likely to be a boon to the cause of nonproliferation”).\n318.

Indictment, supra note 65.\n\nattribution campaign in October 2018. $^{324}$  If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325. See Finkle, supra note 135 (discussing public praise for Mandiant's APT1 report).\n326. See supra notes 130-132.\n327. See supra note 125 (discussing confirmations of CrowdStrike's attribution by companies and researchers); see also supra note 96 and accompanying text (discussing other governments' confirmations of the DNC attribution).\nCyberattack Attribution\nattempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack. After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible, and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case. To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions. But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases\n. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n. See Kopan, supra note 328.\n. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details).\n. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach, but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions. As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n. See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nplus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc. The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n."

The Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible. # I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION \"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19] See, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who 67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020) As Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”²⁰ In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.²¹ Nonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶ operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . ."

Cyberattack Attribution attribution with other responses means that government attributions run a greater risk of escalation than nongovernmental attributions. Notably, not all cybersecurity companies are willing to make public attributions to governments or think such attributions are a good idea. A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”¹³⁷ Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.¹³⁸ In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.¹³⁹ ## C. The Purposes of Attribution Very often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals. ¹³⁷ Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

REV. 520 (2020) One of the most frequently cited purposes of public attributions is macro-level deterrence.¹⁴⁰ The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”¹⁴¹ U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.¹⁴² The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”¹⁴³ Victim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.¹⁴⁴ The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.¹⁴⁵ Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution. ¹⁴⁰.

Nye, Jr., Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace, INT’L SECURITY, Winter 2016/2017, at 44, 45 (“Deterrence means dissuading someone from doing something by making them believe that the costs to them will exceed their expected benefit.”); see also, e.g., Keitner, supra note 31, at 210 (identifying deterrence as one purpose of U.S. attributions-by-indictment). ¹⁴¹.

Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cybercom Contemplates Information Warfare to Counter Russian Interference in 2020 Election, WASH. POST (Dec. 25, 2019), Cyberattack Attribution Measuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149] https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\")."

This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures. Finally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace."

Cyberattack Attribution 557 Such lack of clarity about states' actions is not unique to cyberattacks,¹⁶³ but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.¹⁶⁴ Publicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵ Development of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third ¹⁶³. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret). ¹⁶⁴. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”). ¹⁶⁵. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy). ¹⁶⁶. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”). ¹⁶⁷.

REV. 520 (2020) party audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.”¹⁶⁸ Translated into the language of customary international law: [P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹ To be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom. Even absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole. The purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part. ¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4. ¹⁶⁹. *Id.* at 11–12. ¹⁷⁰. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace. Cyberattack Attribution ## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION Assuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system. ## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General International law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky. Some support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice. Although the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,¹⁷³ it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.¹⁷⁴ In"

Law Review\n# The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution\nKristen E. Eichensehr\n# ABSTRACT\nAttribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR\nAssistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

REV. 520 (2020)\n# INTRODUCTION\nFiguring out who's doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.¹ Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.² Another is insurance coverage.³ Invoking\n1. Some use the terms “computer network exploitation” and “computer network attack” to denote intrusions aimed at spying and damaging or disruptive intrusions, respectively, but the line between categories blurs in practice. See, e.g., Bruce Schneier, There’s No Real Difference Between Online Espionage and Online Attack, ATLANTIC (Mar. 6, 2014), https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/theres-no-real-difference-between-online-espionage-and-online-attack/284233 [https://perma.cc/3B2Y-K66T]; Kim Zetter, Hacker Lexicon: What Are CNE and CNA?, WIRED (July 6, 2016, 8:00 AM), https://www.wired.com/2016/07/hacker-lexicon-cne-cna [https://perma.cc/6DJZ-2B2N]. I therefore use “cyberattack” throughout the Article in the colloquial sense as an umbrella term for malicious computer or network intrusions. Unless otherwise noted, the term is not meant to indicate that an intrusion is an “attack” for purposes of the international law governing the use of force.\n2. See 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (2018) (defining economic espionage to require theft of a trade secret with the perpetrator “intending or knowing that the offense will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent”).\n3. Yet another context where attribution may matter is cases where individuals sue for harm caused by data breaches. Judges have made assumptions about the identity of hackers—specifically that they are criminals intent on committing fraud—in assessing the risk of harm to plaintiffs for purposes of establishing the injury in fact required for standing. See, e.g., Remijas v. Neiman Marcus Grp., LLC, 794 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding a “substantial risk of harm” sufficient for standing because “[p]resumably, the purpose of the hack is, sooner or later, to make fraudulent charges or assume those consumers’ identities”). For data breaches attributed to government actors, however, judges’ views about the likelihood or nature of potential harm might change. This issue recently came before the D.C. Circuit in a case involving the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack, which a security firm has attributed to China. See infra note 129 and accompanying text. Despite the possible espionage-related motives for the breach, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs’ risk of identity theft was sufficient for standing. In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 56–58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In dissent, Judge Stephen Williams disagreed, discounting the likelihood of identity theft and calling the breach more likely “the handiwork of foreign spies looking to harvest information about millions of federal workers for espionage or kindred purposes having nothing to do with identity theft.” Id. at 76 (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court rejected the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. See Order, In Re U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., Nos. 17-5217 &amp; 17-5232 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 2019) (denying petitions for rehearing en banc).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncoverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.⁴ Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline⁵ to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.⁶ The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,⁷ scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules\n4.

REV. 520 (2020)\nof international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.⁸ But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.⁹ A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.¹⁰ Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.¹¹ This results in a double challenge for\n8.

REV. 1487, 1493 (2017) (highlighting the “substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations”). One of the best treatments of the relationship between attributions and international law is Martha Finnemore &amp; Duncan B. Hollis, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity, EURO. J. INT’L L. (forthcoming 2020) (draft dated Oct. 30, 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347958. Like this Article, Finnemore and Hollis make the point that public attributions (which they call “accusations”) can contribute to the formation of international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Id. at 5. They do not, however, focus on setting an evidentiary standard for attributions, as this Article does, and instead flag the issue as one for future development. Cf. id. at 19 (“As accusations of cyber-operations become more common, we expect demands for documentation to rise, along with efforts to normalize how much substantiation should accompany an accusation.”).\n10. Of course, some modifications are necessary. See, e.g., Kristen E. Eichensehr, Cyberwar and International Law Step Zero, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 357, 375–79 (2015) (discussing areas where cyberspecific law of war rules may be needed).\n11. See, e.g., James A. Green, Fluctuating Evidentiary Standards for Self-Defence in the International Court of Justice, 58 INT’L &amp; COMP. L.Q. 163, 164 (2009) (“One of the most pressing and fundamentally overlooked questions relating to the international legal regulation of self-defence is the standard of evidence to be applied in assessing the lawfulness of such a claim.”); Jules Lobel, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 YALE J.

Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,¹³ it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have\nabstract issues involved in defining relevant international law standards.”); Marco Roscini, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n¹². The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F. Manning, *Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation*, 124 HARV. L. REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted . . . ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n¹³. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted. Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law. But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important. In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.\nThe third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design. To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution \"system,\" such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling\n14.

See infra Part III.\nCyberattack Attribution\ndefense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\"Attribution\" has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \"attribution\" refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.\nSee, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nAs Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”²⁰ In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.²¹\nNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶\noperated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack . . .\n20.

DAVIS II ET AL., STATELESS ATTRIBUTION: TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CYBERSPACE 9–16 (2017), https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2000/RR2081/RAND_RR2081.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UNZ-XK9S]; Lin, supra note 19, at 80–84; and Thomas Rid &amp; Ben Buchanan, Attributing Cyber Attacks, 38 J. STRATEGIC STUD. 4, 14–23 (2015).\n23. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 15 (describing “atomic, behavioural, and computed” indicators of compromise).\n24. See id. at 17–18 (discussing reuse of infrastructure and software as means of attributing attacks).\n25. See id. at 19; see also Lin, supra note 19, at 90 (“[T]he language setting for the keyboard of a particular computer . . . raises the likelihood that a human perpetrator is from a nation in which that language is used.”).\n26. See, e.g., Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 19 (discussing potential use of language indicators in false flag operations). The best-known example of a false flag operation is a 2015 attack on a French television station, TV5Monde. A group claiming to be the “Cyber Caliphate” took credit and posted pro-Islamic State propaganda on the station’s social media accounts, but the attack was later attributed to Russia. See DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 13; see also Gordon Corera, How France’s TV5 Was Almost Destroyed by ‘Russian Hackers’, BBC (Oct. 10, 2016), https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375 [https://perma.cc/JA94-LFMF] (discussing the attack and attribution to Russia).\nCyberattack Attribution\nMoving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines \"attribution\" as \"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27\nWhile technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States\nThe practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon. The first public accusation by the U.S. government\n27.

Clapper told Congress that most hackers \"can no longer assume that their activities will remain undetected. Nor can they assume that if detected, they will be able to conceal their identities. Governmental and private sector security professionals have made significant advances in detecting and attributing cyber intrusions.\"37 In September 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) characterized cyberattack attribution as \"difficult but not impossible.\"38\n33.

REV. 520 (2020)\nThe advances in technical attribution may be matched over time by advances in attackers' ability to mask their identities, creating a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities in which the two sides will alternate having the advantage.³⁹ This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”⁴⁰\nThe United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years.⁴¹ Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal\n[https://perma.cc/D9PZ-D3FD]) (“[T]he increasing number of national security cyber cases . . . reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.”).\n39.

Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals \"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\" including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets. In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference. The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election. Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were \"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack\n48. Exec. Order No. 13,694, 80 Fed. Reg. 18,077, 18,077-78 (Apr. 2, 2015). Sanctions under the Executive Order do not depend on foreign government involvement; the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions for routine cybercrime issues as well. See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Treasury Sanctions Two Individuals for Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities (Dec. 29, 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0693.aspx [https://perma.cc/C2CB-SP6N] (detailing sanctions against two Russians for distribution of malware and associated theft of information). The Treasury Department has also used country-specific sanctions regimes to attribute cyberattacks to foreign governments.

For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\nThe final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases.

For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement,⁶⁰ and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later.⁶¹ Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.⁶²\nThe attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution\nStates should be substantiated.\"¹⁰⁹ But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to \"substantiate\" accusations.¹¹⁰\nSince the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated.¹¹¹ Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained:\n[D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.¹¹²\n¹⁰⁹. *Id.* at 13.\n¹¹⁰.

Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors\nGovernments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years.¹¹⁹ As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.¹²⁰\nIn high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft.¹²¹ Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.¹²²\n¹¹⁸.

REV. 520 (2020)\nNongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways.¹²³ First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information.¹²⁴ The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.¹²⁵\nSecond, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets,¹²⁶ but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.¹²⁷ The closest the United States came to\n¹²³.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society. For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government. It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.\nThird and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers.

To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state.¹³⁵ But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators.¹³⁶ The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”¹³⁷ Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.¹³⁸ In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.¹³⁹\n## C. The Purposes of Attribution\nVery often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.\n¹³⁷ Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

REV. 520 (2020)\nOne of the most frequently cited purposes of public attributions is macro-level deterrence.¹⁴⁰ The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”¹⁴¹ U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.¹⁴² The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”¹⁴³\nVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.¹⁴⁴ The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.¹⁴⁵ Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n¹⁴⁰.

Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cybercom Contemplates Information Warfare to Counter Russian Interference in 2020 Election, WASH. POST (Dec. 25, 2019),\nCyberattack Attribution\nMeasuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities. But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments. Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, \"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\" The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with \"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\" all designed \"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n146.

But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial. Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal. Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence, though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may\n150.

Ministry of Def., supra note 91 (noting that the government publicized the Russian officers involved in order to \"hamper any further attempts by them to operate internationally\").\n151. A similar micro-level deterrence strategy may be influencing reported U.S. operations to alert individual Russian operatives that the United States is aware of their election interference-related actions. See Julian E. Barnes, U.S. Begins First Cyberoperations Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections, N.Y. TIMES (Oct. 23, 2018), https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/russian-hacking-usa-cyber-command.html [https://perma.cc/U9B9-Y5ZY] (reporting that U.S. Cyber Command targeted \"individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work,\" and noting that \"anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government's actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions\"); see also supra note 145 and accompanying text (discussing similar operations related to the 2020 election).\n152. Even commentators skeptical of macro-level deterrence acknowledge the potential micro-level deterrent effect of public attributions. See Goldsmith &amp; Williams, supra note 148 (\"The indictments rarely result in prosecution but do expose the alleged wrongdoers publicly, prevent them from traveling and perhaps embarrass them in certain circles. These costs are not nothing; would-be state-sponsored cyberintruders and their principals surely take them into account\").\nCyberattack Attribution\nbe less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. $^{153}$ The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. $^{154}$ Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. $^{155}$\nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort. Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems. This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS \"contain[ed] indicators of\n153. See, e.g., Nakashima, supra note 150 (discussing the arrest of a Russian hacker in the Netherlands).\n154. Relatedly, governmental and nongovernmental attributors should consider the likely consequences to individual hackers outed in attributions; the consequences imposed by their national governments may be far worse than any by the attributing entity. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 530-31 (highlighting due process and privacy concerns stemming from attributions to particular individuals).\n155. See, e.g., Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that U.S. indictments \"can make it more difficult for states to recruit the manpower and resources for cyber-attacks\"). However, these tactics may backfire. See America's Government Is Putting Foreign Cyber-Spies in the Dock, ECONOMIST (Sept. 13, 2018), https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/13/americas-government-is-putting-foreign-cyber-spies-in-the-dock [https://perma.cc/2CFF-NP7K] (reporting that U.S. government hackers are concerned that U.S. indictments could prompt retaliation, such as arrests of U.S. government hackers).\n156.

See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 17 (\"[A] public attribution statement may encourage victims or other vulnerable populations to bolster network defenses.\"); Hunt, supra note 38 (explaining the U.K. strategy to accompany public attributions with details about \"how [a cyber intrusion] was done, thereby helping the cyber security industry to develop protective measures\"); MANDIANT, supra note 121, at 6 (explaining publication of the APT1 report that attributed intrusions to China on the grounds that \"we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively\").\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncompromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\" and specifically noted that the alert aimed \"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act. But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible. Such an attribution could be done privately, but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n158. Alert TA18-074A, supra note 57.\n159. But see Nye, supra note 140, at 54 (asserting that \"deterrence by denial . . . is indifferent to attribution\").\n160. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 27, at 75 art. 22 (\"The wrongfulness of an act of a State not in conformity with an international obligation towards another State is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\").\n161. See id. at 129 art. 49 para. 1 (\"An injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act.\"); see also Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hung. v. Slovk.), 1997 I.C.J. 7, 55 (Sept. 25) (explaining that for a countermeasure to be lawful \"it must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State\").\n162. See supra notes 144-145 and accompanying text (discussing private attributions).\nCyberattack Attribution\n557\nSuch lack of clarity about states' actions is not unique to cyberattacks,¹⁶³ but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.¹⁶⁴\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵\nDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \"serv[e] as an opening bid\" and can \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster \"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third\n¹⁶³. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n¹⁶⁴. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”).\n¹⁶⁵. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy).\n¹⁶⁶. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”).\n¹⁶⁷.

REV. 520 (2020)\nparty audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.”¹⁶⁸ Translated into the language of customary international law:\n[P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n¹⁶⁹. *Id.* at 11–12.\n¹⁷⁰. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response . . . signal[s] to adversaries . . . that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution\n## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION\nAssuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General\nInternational law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The \"clear and convincing\" standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,¹⁷³ it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.¹⁷⁴ In\n171. Green, supra note 11, at 165 (“[I]nternational law does not have a clear benchmark against which the persuasiveness or reliability of evidence may be gauged for the purposes of attributing responsibility or assessing legal claims.”); Mary Ellen O’Connell, Evidence of Terror, 7 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 19, 21 (2002) (lamenting the lack of “any well-established set of rules governing evidence in international law in general or in the case of self-defence in particular”).\n172. See Green, supra note 11, at 163 (“[T]he evidentiary standards applicable to the law on the use of force, as with international law more generally, remain extremely unclear.”); O’Connell, supra note 171, at 21 (“How much objective evidence is needed before responding with force [in self-defense to an armed attack] is largely an open question.”).\n173.

(“That a litigant seeking to establish a fact bears the burden of proving it is a commonplace, well-established in the Court’s jurisprudence.” (internal citation omitted)).\n174. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 166 (noting that the ICJ “has avoided explicitly articulating a general standard with regard to its decisions” and “has employed different standards, depending upon the dispute before it”); Roscini, supra note 11, at 248 (“The\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nthe 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence.¹⁷⁵ She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.”¹⁷⁶ She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear,¹⁷⁷ noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.”¹⁷⁸ Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”¹⁷⁹\nThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide.¹⁸⁰ The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”¹⁸¹ In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.”¹⁸² Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense\nICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n175.

[to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"¹⁸⁵\nScholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice.¹⁸⁶ Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing \"convincing\" or\n¹⁸³. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals \"implicit standards of evidence,\" and specifically that the Court applies a \"clear and convincing\" standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that \"claims related to jus ad bellum violations . . . have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including \"clear and convincing,\" preponderance, and \"prima facie evidence,\" in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n¹⁸⁴. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\" is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n¹⁸⁵. Green, supra note 11, at 167. Michael Schmitt equates the standard to a state's duty to act reasonably. Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"In essence, it obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n¹⁸⁶. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may \"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n67 UCLA L.

Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had \"clear and compelling information\" that Al Qaeda \"had a central role in the attacks.\"¹⁸⁹ The \"clear and compelling\" phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions.¹⁹⁰ It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.¹⁹¹\nWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.”¹⁹² For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense.¹⁹³ If the most serious international offenses, such as\n187.

The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.”¹⁹⁵ The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”¹⁹⁶\nTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release.¹⁹⁷ Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions.¹⁹⁸ But some in the cybersecurity community publicly\n(Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n¹⁹⁴.

Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”²⁰⁸ These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.²⁰⁹ Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”²¹⁰ ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.²¹¹ In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution\nAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been\naffected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n²⁰⁸.

REV. 520 (2020)\nattacked or identify the perpetrator. But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences. Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views. And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes\n212. Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (\"There is no legal obligation requiring a state . . . to publicly attribute hostile cyber activity that it has suffered in all circumstances.\"); supra notes 140-145 and accompanying text (discussing nonpublic attributions).\n213. Some of these consequences occur within individual governments. Making particular decisions legal as opposed to pure policy, for example, will tend to empower lawyers. See generally JACK L. GOLDSMITH, POWER AND CONSTRAINT: THE ACCOUNTABLE PRESIDENCY AFTER 9/11, at xi-xii (2012) (noting the role of executive branch lawyers in policing U.S. military and intelligence activities in the wake of 9/11). The particular international legal standard proposed in this Article—one requiring disclosure of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of attributions—would also empower parts or departments within governments that favor greater transparency to push back against other departments, likely intelligence agencies, that tend to focus more on maintaining the secrecy of sources and methods. See, e.g., infra note 221 and accompanying text.\n214. Cf. Rebecca Ingber, The Obama War Powers Legacy and the Internal Forces That Entrench Executive Power, 110 AM. J. INT'L L. 680, 684 (2016) (\"[W]hen the administration takes a legal position, it is saying that it is bound to take or not to take a particular action, and bound by some external or fixed source. When the administration takes a policy position, it is saying that it has discretion to act in a variety of ways (within\nCyberattack Attribution\na normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.²¹⁵ States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.²¹⁶\nRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.²¹⁷ And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course,\nthe bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n²¹⁵. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent . . . to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n²¹⁶. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n²¹⁷. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.²¹⁸ This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.²¹⁹ States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.²²⁰\nGiven these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n218. Of course, a perpetrator state might wish to keep knowledge of its tactics confined to as few people or entities as possible and thus prefer that even if a victim state discovers the identity of the attacker, the victim remain silent, rather than making a public attribution. But on the other hand, a perpetrator state might prefer to know what the victim knows, which could come out in the evidence given to support a public attribution. Knowing that certain techniques have been discovered and can be traced to the attacking state may have value in itself. The weighing of these competing values is difficult in the abstract and may change depending on the circumstances of particular activities.\n219. See, e.g., Qihoo 360, The CIA Hacking Group (APT-C-39) Conducts Cyber-Espionage Operation on China's Critical Industries for 11 Years, 360 CORE SECURITY (Mar. 2, 2020), https://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html [https://perma.cc/22FW-SLXS] (accusing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of hacking targets in China). Arguably, Kaspersky has also accused the United States, though not explicitly. See supra note 139 and accompanying text (discussing Kaspersky Lab's attributions to the \"Equation Group,\" widely understood to refer to the NSA); see also Romanosky &amp; Boudreaux, supra note 41, at 27–28 (speculating about possible reasons for low rates of attribution to the U.S. government).\n220. Even a requirement to provide evidence is not a foolproof deterrent. Evidence can be faked. See, e.g., Bobby Chesney &amp; Danielle Citron, Deep Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security, 107 CALIF. L. REV. 1753 (2019) (discussing the pernicious possible effects of deep fake video and audio recordings).\nCyberattack Attribution\n569\ndetail. The most likely explanations do not withstand scrutiny, however, and other incentives should counsel in favor of developing a legal standard.\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.²²¹ Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.²²² If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.²²³ Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”²²⁴ Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence\n221. See Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (noting that “the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information” to support the attribution).\n222. Cf. Ashley S. Deeks, *Predicting Enemies*, 104 VA. L. REV. 1529, 1589–90 (2018) (urging the United States to be transparent about its legal and policy decisions on military use of algorithms in order to shape the direction of international law in the area).\n223. See infra notes 277–278 and accompanying text (discussing U.N. General Assembly resolutions).\n224. See Kristen Eichensehr, *Risky Business: When Governments Do Not Attribute State-Sponsored Cyberattacks*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL.: NET POLITICS BLOG (Oct. 4, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/risky-business-when-governments-do-not-attribute-state-sponsored-cyberattacks [https://perma.cc/QS6L-V857] (proposing the “cyber CSI effect”).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nprosecutors can produce.²²⁵ Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,²²⁶ but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance.²²⁷ If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n225. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler, Viewing CSI and the Threshold of Guilt: Managing Truth and Justice in Reality and Fiction, 115 YALE L.J. 1050, 1052 (2006) (describing the \"CSI effect\" as occurring when \"people who watch the series develop unrealistic expectations about the type of evidence typically available during trials, which, in turn, increases the likelihood that they will have a 'reasonable doubt' about a defendant's guilt\").\n226. See Int'l Law Comm'n, supra note 211, at 130 (noting that assessing the existence of \"a general practice\" for purposes of customary international law \"refers primarily to the practice of States\" and sometimes to \"the practice of international organizations,\" while \"[c]onduct of other actors is not practice that contributes to the formation, or expression, of rules of customary international law, but may be relevant when assessing the practice\" of states). But see id. at 132 (explaining that in some circumstances the conduct of nonstate and noninternational organization entities like corporations \"may have an indirect role in the identification of customary international law, by stimulating or recording the practice and acceptance as law (opinio juris) of States\").\n227. See, e.g., JACK GOLDSMITH, HOOVER INST., CYBERSECURITY TREATIES: A SKEPTICAL VIEW (2011), http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/FutureChallenges_Goldsmith.pdf [https://perma.cc/2DLX-V979] (discussing hurdles, including verification, to cybersecurity treaties).\nCyberattack Attribution\n571\neffects, supporting stability and helping to avoid conflict over cyberspace. Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,²²⁸ but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace—an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.²²⁹ This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.²³⁰\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.²³¹ Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to\n228. See H.L.A. HART, THE CONCEPT OF LAW 94 (3d ed., 2012) (explaining that “while primary rules are concerned with the actions that individuals must or must not do, these secondary rules are all concerned with the primary rules themselves” and determine, among other things how violation of primary norms can be “conclusively determined”).\n229. See, e.g., TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 80 (“Primary rules are those that set forth international law obligations. Breach of them results in State responsibility. Secondary rules lay out the general conditions for a State’s responsibility, as well as the consequences of violating a primary rule.”); Int’l Law Comm’n, supra note 27, at 31 (distinguishing between the primary rules that “define the content of international obligations, [and] the breach of which gives rise to responsibility,” and “the secondary rules of State responsibility”).\n230. Setting an evidentiary standard may differentially affect states, making it more difficult for states that have less sophisticated cyber capabilities to make public attributions. This possibility does not undermine the need for an evidentiary standard, but it does highlight one important role that an international entity for cyberattack attributions could play, namely, ensuring that less sophisticated victims have access to pro bono assistance in investigating cyberattacks. See infra notes 305–307 accompanying text (discussing the role of an international entity in assisting victims).\n231. Cf. Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 116, at 636 (making the converse point that currently “[t]he legal uncertainty surrounding the attribution process may also tip the balance, at times, toward maintaining silence and ambiguity concerning cyberoperations”); see also infra note 280 and accompanying text (discussing how the proposed evidentiary standard can level the playing field for provision of evidence).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncomply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency²³²—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution\nIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law\nSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.”²³³ A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable\n232. See infra note 304 and accompanying text (discussing a new attribution entity as a way to standardize private attributors’ methodologies).\n233. CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE CRIMINAL § 111 (4th ed.); see also U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MANUAL § 9–11.101 (2018), https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.101 [https://perma.cc/GFA5-XDPN] (“[T]he grand jury’s principal function is to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that one or more persons committed a certain Federal offense within the venue of the district court.”).\nCyberattack Attribution\ncause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged.²³⁴ The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”²³⁵\nThe standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme.²³⁶ The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts.²³⁷ A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action\n234.

If the grand jury returns an indictment, the prosecutor then chooses whether to sign it and proceed with the case, which would ultimately be determined based on the usual criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. See WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 233, § 101 (explaining that prosecutors have “ultimate veto power over a grand jury decision to indict”); U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, supra note 233, § 9-27.200–250 (discussing considerations prosecutors must take into account in deciding whether to proceed with a prosecution).\n235.

In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court.²³⁹ For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.”²⁴⁰ Other governments use the\n238.

ODNI’s Guide to Cyber Attribution defines “high confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of evidence and context to be beyond a reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative,” and defines “moderate confidence” as “when analysts judge the totality of the evidence and context to be clear and convincing, with only circumstantial cases for alternatives.” OFFICE OF THE DIR.

BACKGROUND TO ASSESSING RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES, supra note 239, at 3 (emphasis added).\nCyberattack Attribution\nsame estimative language.²⁴¹ Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.²⁴² These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act;²⁴³ such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.²⁴⁴ Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards\n241. See, e.g., Press Release, U.K. Nat'l Cyber Sec. Centre, supra note 95 (noting that the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre \"assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU was almost certainly responsible\" for the 2016 hack of the DNC and subsequent release of stolen documents).\n242. But see Raman, supra note 38 (asserting that cybercrime charges are \"brought only when the facts and law justify\" them and \"we can prove them in a courtroom, using admissible evidence, at proof beyond any reasonable doubt\").\n243. See supra note 161 (discussing requirements for countermeasures).\n244. Cf. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 13 (noting that public attributions \"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\").\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nwould not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.²⁴⁵\nAdditionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.²⁴⁶ That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution\nThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.²⁴⁷ Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n245. See infra notes 248–255 and accompanying text (discussing operation of the proposed evidentiary standard). There is an obvious workaround for instances in which a state seeks to indict or sanction an individual who engages in cyberattacks on behalf of a foreign state: indict or sanction the individual without naming the state. The indicting or sanctioning state could still apply its domestic law to the accused individual when it cannot meet the proposed international law evidentiary standard. This may seem like a formalism, but the distinction is important. Only the acts of states determine customary international law, so without an allegation of state involvement, the indictment or sanctions can be severed from the process of setting primary norms of international law. It remains simply a routine exercise of a state’s law enforcement authority.\n246. See Ingber, supra note 214 and accompanying text.\n247. See Eichensehr, supra note 10, at 358 (terming this the “international law step-zero question”); see generally Rebecca Crootof, Regulating New Weapons Technology, in THE IMPACT OF EMERGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (Eric Talbot Jensen &amp; Ronald T.P. Alcala eds., forthcoming 2019), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195980 (discussing various factors for determining when new international law is required to regulate new weapons technologies).\nCyberattack Attribution\nFor the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.²⁴⁸ For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.²⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”²⁵⁰\nAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.²⁵¹\nMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n248. See supra notes 173–190 and accompanying text.\n249. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosn. &amp; Herz. v. Serb. &amp; Montenegro), Judgment, 2007 I.C.J. 43, 129, ♦ 209 (Feb. 26) (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n250. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 82. Ultimately, the Manual takes a very on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand approach. After suggesting that the graver the attack the more evidence will be required, the Manual then notes essentially the opposite logic: states facing severe cyberattacks may be less able to muster robust attribution evidence than states facing less significant attacks. Id.\n251. See TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81 (“With respect to ex ante uncertainty as to the attribution of cyber operations, . . . States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.”); Egan, supra note 112.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility.²⁵² Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,²⁵³ including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante,²⁵⁴ and accountability for decisions ex post.²⁵⁵\nThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may\n252. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 28 (arguing that when details about attribution “are made public, the quality of the attribution is likely to increase” and that publication “may generate new evidence and analysis”).\n253.

The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use. CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution. Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions. In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.\n256. See supra notes 121–125 and accompanying text.\n257. See Nakashima, supra note 125 (discussing confirmations by Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect).\n258. Cf. Rid &amp; Buchanan, supra note 22, at 27–28 (describing the 2014 PLA indictment as “exceptionally detailed” despite the fact that it contained “very few forensic details” as compared to the Mandiant APT1 report on the same actors).\n259. See, e.g., Alert TA17–132A, supra note 53 (providing indicators of compromise related to WannaCry and noting that the alert was updated after the U.S. government attributed WannaCry to North Korea); see also Alert TA18–074A, supra note 57 (providing indicators of compromise and other technical details related to Russian government targeting of various critical infrastructure sectors). Release of technical details should be done carefully and in such a way as to cause neither undue alarm nor confusion. See\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.²⁶⁰ Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.²⁶¹ A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.²⁶² Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures.²⁶³ For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution—\nROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n²⁶⁰. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n²⁶¹. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n²⁶². See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n²⁶³. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution\nand thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.²⁶⁴ Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.²⁶⁵ If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable\n264. See supra text accompanying note 245 (discussing how domestic law provides an evidentiary floor for some mechanisms used to attribute cyberattacks to states).\n265. See Eichensehr, supra note 110 (discussing the low evidentiary basis needed for private-sector notifications to account holders targeted by state-sponsored actors when the notifications do not identify a particular state). That is not to say that more evidence is undesirable: additional evidence up to or exceeding the level of enabling crosschecking would still serve the systemic purpose of promoting stability.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\ncrosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention. In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures. The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate\n266. For discussions of, for example, whether election interference violates the prohibition on intervention, see Ryan Goodman, International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference, JUST SECURITY (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www.justsecurity.org/35999/international-law-response-russian-election-interference [https://perma.cc/M4P3-A58L], and Duncan Hollis, Russia and the DNC Hack: What Future for a Duty of Non-Intervention?, OPINIJOURIS (July 25, 2016), http://opiniojuris.org/2016/07/25/russia-and-the-dnc-hack-a-violation-of-the-duty-of-non-intervention [https://perma.cc/WAP8-7TNZ].\n267. See supra notes 160-161 and accompanying text (discussing countermeasures).\nCyberattack Attribution\ninternational law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law.²⁶⁸ In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,²⁶⁹ setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.²⁷⁰\nThe process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.²⁷¹ Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.²⁷² Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n268. See, e.g., Ashley Deeks, *An International Legal Framework for Surveillance*, 55 VA. J. INT'L. L. 291, 300–15 (2014) (discussing the reasons for the traditional view that international law either affirmatively permits or at least does not prohibit espionage and why those reasons may be under pressure).\n269. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text.\n270. See supra notes 163–169 and accompanying text (discussing the iterative process of norm-creation through attributions).\n271. This Article focuses on creating an evidentiary standard through the development of norms and customary international law, but the standard could also be set by treaty. The prospects for such a treaty, however, seem dim as no cybersecurity treaties have yet garnered the kind of worldwide participation—that is, participation of both accusers and accused—that would make them most useful, and negotiations at the U.N. GGE previously broke down over issues of the application of international law to cyberspace. See Elaine Korzak, *UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?*, DIPLOMAT (July 31, 2017), https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe [https://perma.cc/29T4-QMXK] (discussing disagreement in the 2017 GGE over international law). In the immediate term, norms and customary international law appear more promising vehicles because states can begin to set state practice and *opinio juris* unilaterally and in smaller groups, and such progress does not require the agreement of other states.\n272. See, e.g., supra notes 258–259 and accompanying text (discussing technical details and government attributions).\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.²⁷³ That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”²⁷⁴ States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”²⁷⁵ Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.²⁷⁶ This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N.

The proposed customary international law rule would instantiate several of the features that Laurence Helfer and Ingrid Wuerth suggest make the formation of custom more likely, including having “powerful states (or groups of like-min[d]ed countries) advance new rules that respond to emerging global problems or seek to overcome distributional differences by promoting rules with compelling normative content.” Helfer &amp; Wuerth, supra note 216, at 609.\n277.

In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.²⁸⁰ Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard\n278.

Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.²⁸² Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining\n281.

DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION\nSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.²⁸⁴\n283. See, e.g., Jasmin Johurun Nessa, *Self-Defense in International Law: What Level of Evidence?*, JUST SECURITY (July 8, 2019), https://www.justsecurity.org/64796/self-defense-in-international-law-what-level-of-evidence [https://perma.cc/QLD9-7MX5] (discussing the Iran examples and debates about the standard of evidence required for self defense).\n284. JASON HEALEY ET AL., ATLANTIC COUNCIL, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN CYBERSPACE: A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY 10 (2014),\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nThe Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.”²⁸⁵ The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,”²⁸⁶ and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.²⁸⁷\nAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.²⁸⁸ Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.”²⁸⁹ Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish.²⁹⁰ Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.”²⁹¹ The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”²⁹²\nAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.²⁹³ RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n285.

Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency. Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution. An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often\n294.

For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.”³⁰² Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.”³⁰³ It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”³⁰⁴\nFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.”³⁰⁵ This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.³⁰⁶ An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.³⁰⁷ This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n302. Id. at 20.\n303. Id. at 19.\n304.

HEALEY ET AL., supra note 284, at 10 (noting that the proposed Council “can help raise the expected attribution for states with lower attribution capacity by leveraging that of advanced cyber powers”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.\nA new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some\n308.

REV. 520 (2020)\ngovernments out may exacerbate the perception that the entity's attributions are politicized or that its choice of cases to investigate is skewed.³¹⁰\nAll of these challenges suggest that while there is value to creating an entity in some form, it should become an additional participant in the current decentralized attribution system—centralization within decentralization as it were. This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).³¹¹ An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.³¹² But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.³¹³\nThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.³¹⁴\nFirst, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,³¹⁵ the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,³¹⁶ but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n310. In a future project, I plan to address how best to structure an international entity to minimize the risks identified here and to maximize the beneficial role such an entity could play in a decentralized attribution system.\n311.

Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.³¹⁷ For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.³¹⁸ Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.³¹⁹ By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim.³²⁰ These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.³²¹ Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,³²² and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.³²³ The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated\n317. Technology is enabling sophisticated nongovernmental capabilities and greater transparency in other areas previously dominated by governments as well.

REV. 520 (2020)\nattribution campaign in October 2018. $^{324}$  If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity. An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above, some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack. It has also resulted in some\n324. See sources cited supra note 95.\n325.

See supra note 125 (discussing confirmations of CrowdStrike's attribution by companies and researchers); see also supra note 96 and accompanying text (discussing other governments' confirmations of the DNC attribution).\nCyberattack Attribution\nattempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.³²⁸ After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,³²⁹ and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.³³⁰ To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.³³¹ But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases\n³²⁸. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n³²⁹.

See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n67 UCLA L. REV. 520 (2020)\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,³³² but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.³³³ As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States),\n³³². See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n³³³.

Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution\nplus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.³³⁴ The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION\nCyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n³³⁴ Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n."

Law Review # The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution Kristen E. Eichensehr # ABSTRACT Attribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards.\nInstead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence.\nThis Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.\n# AUTHOR Assistant Professor, UCLA School of Law.

DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION 587 CONCLUSION 597\n\n# INTRODUCTION\nFiguring out who's doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.¹ Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.² Another is insurance coverage.³ Invoking\n\nCyberattack Attribution coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.⁴ Still other important examples involve cyber-based responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline⁵ to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\nCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.⁶ The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\nNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,⁷ scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules of international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.⁸ But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.⁹ A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non-cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.¹⁰ Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.¹¹ This results in a double challenge for Cyberattack Attribution those deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing *lex generalis* from the non-cyberspace context is hard to do, and *lex specialis* governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized.¹² At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\nAs both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,¹³ it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.\nThis Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.\nFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have abstract issues involved in defining relevant international law standards.”); Marco Roscini, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, 50 TEX. INT’L L.J. 233, 242 (2015) (noting that cyberattack investigations “are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law”). In contrast to this Article’s focus on international law evidentiary standards in general and their relationship to domestic law standards, Roscini focuses narrowly on the evidentiary standards for “inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations” and the International Court of Justice in particular. *Id.* at 242–43.\n¹². The principle that the specific prevails over the general is common among legal systems and well-established as a matter of international law. See, e.g., Int’l Law Comm’n, Rep. on the Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, ¶ 59, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682 (Apr. 13, 2006), https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_l682.pdf [https://perma.cc/ L5LA-82WE] (citing Grotius and explaining that “[t]he idea that special enjoys priority over general has a long pedigree in international jurisprudence”); John F. Manning, *Separation of Powers as Ordinary Interpretation*, 124 HARV. L. REV. 1939, 2012 (2011) (referring to the “deeply rooted... ‘specificity maxim,’” which “holds, quite simply, that ‘the specific governs the general’”).\n¹³. For the most comprehensive attempt to track cyberattacks attributed to states, see *Cyber Operations Tracker*, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN REL., https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations [https://perma.cc/KQG6-E22Y] (last visited May 9, 2020) (collecting “publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005”).\n\nasserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.[14] Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\nThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.[15] But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.[16] In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.[17] The third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.[18] To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution\"system,\"such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling Cyberattack Attribution defense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.\nThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\n# I. THE PRACTICE AND PURPOSES OF ATTRIBUTION\"Attribution\"has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level,\"attribution\"refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.[19] See, e.g., Herbert Lin, Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts, J. INT'L AFF., Winter 2016, at 75, 89 (\"[T]he question of ‘who is responsible?’ can be answered by pointing to a specific machine (or machines), a specific perpetrator acting to set the intrusion into motion, and a specific adversary as the ultimately responsible party.\"); Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyber Attacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 J. CONFLICT &amp; SECURITY L. 229, 233 (2012) (\"What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who As Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”²⁰ In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.²¹ Nonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.²² When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.²³ The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.²⁴ Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,²⁵ but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.²⁶ operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack...\n\nCyberattack Attribution Moving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines\"attribution\"as\"the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.\"27 While technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.\nThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities' views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article's prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\n# A. The Practice of States The practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.[28] The first public accusation by the U.S. government came in 2014, when the United States accused five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) of hacking U.S. companies to steal intellectual property.²⁹ Attributions were almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon until 2017,³⁰ when state-to-state attributions increased significantly.³¹ The move to publicly attribute cyberattacks to governments first required improvements in the technical capacity for attribution.³² In a 2010 Foreign Affairs article, then Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn signaled the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks, writing that “[t]he forensic evidence of a governmental role, but it indicates a possibility.” Associated Press, Estonian Links Moscow to Internet Attack, N.Y. TIMES (May 18, 2007), https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/world/europe/18estonia.html [https://perma.cc/URK3-V89F] (quoting Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo); see also Damien McGuinness, How a Cyber Attack Transformed Estonia, BBC (Apr. 27, 2017), https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415 [https://perma.cc/D3PY-G2EQ] (reporting that “on condition of anonymity,” an Estonian government official “suggested the attack ‘was orchestrated by the Kremlin, and malicious gangs then seized the opportunity to join in’”). Georgian officials have similarly suggested Russian government involvement in DDoS attacks on Georgia in 2008. See Noah Shachtman, Top Georgian Official: Moscow Cyber Attacked Us—We Just Can’t Prove It, WIRED (Mar. 11, 2009), https://www.wired.com/2009/03/georgia-blames [https://perma.cc/4URK-X6SL] (reporting a Georgian government official’s allegation that the Russian government organized the cyberattacks).\n\nCyberattack Attribution work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all.\"33 Scholars at the time echoed the idea that attribution was difficult, if not impossible.34 But U.S. officials soon began to signal that the U.S. government had significantly improved its attribution capabilities. In a 2012 speech, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained that over the prior two years, the Defense Department had\"made significant advances\"in attributing cyberattacks.35 He warned,\"[p]otential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.\"36 In 2015, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper told Congress that most hackers\"can no longer assume that their activities will remain undetected. Nor can they assume that if detected, they will be able to conceal their identities. Governmental and private sector security professionals have made significant advances in detecting and attributing cyber intrusions.\"37 In September 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) characterized cyberattack attribution as\"difficult but not impossible.\"38 The advances in technical attribution may be matched over time by advances in attackers' ability to mask their identities, creating a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities in which the two sides will alternate having the advantage.³⁹ This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”⁴⁰ The United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years.⁴¹ Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal [https://perma.cc/D9PZ-D3FD]) (“[T]he increasing number of national security cyber cases... reflect our increasingly sophisticated ability to attribute this criminal conduct to the individuals and states involved.”).\n\nCyberattack Attribution intellectual property. As has become routine in attributions-by-indictment, the fifty-six-page indictment alleges violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, and computer damage. The indictment also includes charges of economic espionage and trade secret theft, which are typical in cases involving theft of intellectual property. Other indictments have followed. For example, in 2017, a federal grand jury indicted two Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers for directing a hack that compromised 500 million Yahoo accounts. And in early 2020, a federal grand jury indicted four members of China's PLA for the 2017 hack of consumer credit reporting agency Equifax—a breach that compromised the personal information of 145 million U.S. victims. \nThe second mechanism the United States has used for attributions is imposition of economic sanctions. These attributions-by-sanctions fall under the purview of the Treasury Department. Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals\"engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities,\"including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.[48] In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.[49] The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia's intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.[50] Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were\"[i]n response to [North Korea's] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack Cyberattack Attribution targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51 The third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57 The final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing the cyberattack to the North Korean government.⁵⁸ Similarly, DHS and the DNI issued a statement attributing the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Russian government.⁵⁹ Often, such attributions-by-press release are the first in a series of U.S. governmental attributions and responsive actions.\nThe U.S. government frequently deploys more than one mechanism to attribute a particular cyberattack, including rolling out different attribution methods over the course of months or even years. For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement,⁶⁰ and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later.⁶¹ Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attribution-by-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.⁶² The attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement⁶³ with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers.⁶⁴ Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller Cyberattack Attribution presented and a grand jury returned an indictment charging twelve GRU officers with hacking-related offenses,⁶⁵ including conspiring to hack “into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” and conspiring to hack “state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.”⁶⁶ Although the United States has used the statement-sanctions-indictment ordering in several high-profile instances, this ordering is not consistent across attributions. In accusing the Iranian government of involvement in DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions, for example, an indictment came first, and sanctions followed more than a year later.⁶⁷ The practice of governmental public attributions broadened significantly in late 2017 and has increased since then. The impetus for the uptick was a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry. In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard.⁶⁸ The ransomware encrypted data on infected machines, locking victims out of their files unless they paid $300 in Bitcoin.⁶⁹ In the United Kingdom, some hospitals diverted ambulances and patients, and https://home.treasury.gov/index.php/news/press-releases/sm0312 [https://perma.cc/9MXW-EJZG] [hereinafter Russia Sanctions Press Release].\n\nnearly 7000 medical appointments were cancelled.⁷⁰ The attack also hit the Russian Interior Ministry and impacted companies including Spain's Telefonica, France's Renault, and FedEx.⁷¹ Spread via phishing emails, the ransomware reportedly “us[ed] a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons”—a method that was stolen and posted online by a group called the “Shadow Brokers.”⁷² Shortly after the attack, press reports indicated that North Korea was responsible,⁷³ but official attributions came only months later. Britain started the ball rolling, with a government minister telling the BBC in October 2017 that North Korea was responsible, but declining to explain the evidentiary basis of the attribution.⁷⁴ Then, in mid-December, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing WannaCry to North Korea and denouncing the country's actions.⁷⁵ White House Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Cyberattack Attribution Bossert explained in a press briefing that the United States\"do[es] not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners,\"citing the support of allied countries and\"[c]ommercial partners,\"including Microsoft and Facebook, which\"act[ed] on their own initiative... without any direction by the U.S. government or coordination to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers.\"76 After the public attributions, additional actions took months. In June 2018, the United States criminally charged a North Korean citizen, alleged to be a member of\"a government-sponsored hacking team,\"for working for\"a North Korean government front company... to support the [North Korean] government's malicious cyber actions,\"including WannaCry.77 The Treasury Department also sanctioned him in September 2018.78 In 2019, the Treasury Department sanctioned additional North Korean entities for their involvement in WannaCry.79 Four significant coordinated attribution efforts have followed the WannaCry attributions.

The United States released an indictment accusing several GRU agents not just of targeting the OPCW, but also of hacking numerous antidoping agencies, including the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association.93 Russia allegedly targeted these organizations due to their\"role in the investigation or public condemnation of Russia's state-sponsored athlete doping program.\"94 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom confirmed the doping related attributions.95 Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom further piled on by attributing the 2016 DNC hack to the GRU.96 A third coordinated attribution in December 2018 garnered less attention. The U.S. Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals with a decade-long campaign of hacking at the behest of China's Ministry of State Cyberattack Attribution Security, and allied countries simultaneously confirmed the accusations. The indictment alleges that the defendants directly hacked dozens of companies and government agencies to steal sensitive data, and starting in 2014, they also hacked “managed service providers”—companies like cloud providers that store information for other companies—and used their unauthorized access to steal intellectual property and other data from the providers’ clients. According to press reports, the compromised companies include Hewlett Packard Enterprises, IBM, and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which builds nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy. Multiple private cybersecurity firms had also identified and tracked the hackers for years, publishing details about the defendants and their exploits. \nThe fourth major coordinated attribution came in late February 2020 when Georgia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, among others, accused Russia of carrying out significant cyberattacks on October 28, 2019 against websites in Georgia, including sites belonging to the Georgian government, nongovernmental organizations, and media outlets.¹⁰⁴ The accusing states did not provide evidence to support their accusations, which Russia denied.¹⁰⁵ But the U.K. statement was notable for its specificity about the high level of certainty within the U.K. government, noting that “[t]he UK’s National Cyber Security Centre…assess[es] that the GRU was almost certainly (95%+) responsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia in October 2019.”¹⁰⁶ In addition to their practice in carrying out attributions to government actors, states have made some explicit statements regarding attribution-related evidentiary issues. The statement supported by the broadest range of countries came in a 2015 U.N. Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report.¹⁰⁷ The GGE included Brazil, China, India, Russia, the United States, and United Kingdom, among others.¹⁰⁸ All of the states agreed that in the cybersecurity context “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against ¹⁰⁴.

Id.\nCyberattack Attribution States should be substantiated.\"¹⁰⁹ But they did not agree on how much or what kind of evidence would suffice to\"substantiate\"accusations.¹¹⁰ Since the 2015 report, China, Russia, and other countries have continued to push the position that accusations must be substantiated.¹¹¹ Having been on the receiving end of attributions, China and Russia of course have a strong interest in forcing accusing countries to disclose as much information as possible since doing so often reveals sources and methods used by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Moreover, China, Russia, and their allies may calculate that given the cost to sources and methods of substantiating attributions, establishing an evidentiary requirement could tamp down on the number of public attributions overall.\nFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained: [D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice—it is not compelled by international law.¹¹² ¹⁰⁹. *Id.* at 13.\n¹¹⁰.

Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors Governments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years.¹¹⁹ As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.¹²⁰ In high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft.¹²¹ Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.¹²² ¹¹⁸.

The first U.S. government attribution came in October 2016. See Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Press Office, supra note 59.\n\nNongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways.¹²³ First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information.¹²⁴ The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.¹²⁵ Second, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets,¹²⁶ but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.¹²⁷ The closest the United States came to ¹²³.

For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.[130] For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country's government.[131] It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.[132] Third and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers. Many of the attributions focus on the same countries that governmental attributions do, namely China, Iran, North government background check, as well as 1.8 million others, including their spouses and friends\").\n\nKorea, and Russia.¹³³ But others have named different governments, including Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.¹³⁴ Finally, the implications of making an attribution differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors. To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state.¹³⁵ But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators.¹³⁶ The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions. Nongovernmental entities are not responsible for responsive actions and therefore may feel somewhat freer to accuse governments in the first place.

A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”¹³⁷ Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.¹³⁸ In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.¹³⁹ ## C. The Purposes of Attribution Very often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.\n¹³⁷ Ellen Nakashima &amp; Aaron Gregg, *They’re On the Lookout for Malware That Can Kill*, WASH.

For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”¹⁴¹ U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.¹⁴² The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”¹⁴³ Victim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.¹⁴⁴ The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.¹⁴⁵ Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\n¹⁴⁰.

Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cybercom Contemplates Information Warfare to Counter Russian Interference in 2020 Election, WASH. POST (Dec. 25, 2019), Cyberattack Attribution Measuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macro-level deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attribution-by-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.[146] But at the same time, state-sponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.[147] Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft,\"the Justice Department's deterrence-by-indictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.\"[148] The Justice Department's own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.[149] https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-cybercom-contemplates-information-warfare-to-counter-russian-interference-in-the-2020-election/2019/12/25/21bb246e-20e8-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html [https://perma.cc/F6FBGL72] (describing the contemplated operation as messaging to individuals combined with\"a limited cyber-operation that demonstrates the Americans' access to a particular system or account and the capability to inflict a cost,\"all designed\"to warn the target that if the election interference did not cease, there would be consequences\").\n\nExpecting public attributions alone to deter states may be asking too much. But public attributions serve other purposes.\nFirst, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries that have extradition treaties with the indicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.[150] Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.[151] Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,[152] though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may Cyberattack Attribution be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians. The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government. Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options. \nAnother purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.[156] Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.[157] This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS\"contain[ed] indicators of compromise...and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures...used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks\"and specifically noted that the alert aimed\"to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\"158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders' likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.\nA third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasures—actions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.[160] But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.[161] Such an attribution could be done privately,[162] but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states' actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.\nFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\n\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states' actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.¹⁶⁵ Development of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states' application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.¹⁶⁶ As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions\"serv[e] as an opening bid\"and can\"lay out the contours of 'bad behavior' along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\"—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.¹⁶⁷ Public attributions foster\"interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third ¹⁶³. For example, the ICJ complained about the lack of agreement on and accessibility of factual evidence in the Nicaragua case. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14, 38 ¶ 57 (June 27) (noting that “[o]ne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute” because “there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them” and because some of the parties’ conduct occurred in secret).\n¹⁶⁴. See Florian J. Egloff, Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia, 41 CONTEMP. SECURITY POL’Y 55, 56 (2020) (“[P]ublic attributions of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the threat perception of the general public.”).\n¹⁶⁵. See Eichensehr, supra note 119, at 529–30 (discussing how public disclosure of attributions by companies promotes accountability for their accuracy).\n¹⁶⁶. Cf. Lin, supra note 19, at 110–11 (“Determining factual reality—important as it is—is only the beginning of the attribution process from a policy perspective.”).\n¹⁶⁷. Finnemore &amp; Hollis, supra note 9, at 10.\n\nparty audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.”¹⁶⁸ Translated into the language of customary international law: [P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.¹⁶⁹ To be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\nEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.¹⁷⁰ In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole.\nThe purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\n¹⁶⁸. *Id.* at 10–11. Finnemore and Hollis use the term “accusation” to encompass, among other things, what I discuss as public attributions. *Id.* at 4.\n¹⁶⁹. *Id.* at 11–12.\n¹⁷⁰. Goldsmith and Williams have acknowledged that public attributions “might also help generate a broader public understanding about Chinese hacking in the hope of galvanizing support among U.S. allies and the public for a diplomatic push against China.” Goldsmith &amp; Williams, *supra* note 148. They argue that these gains are “offset by the massive benefits reaped” by China. *Id.* But my argument focuses not just on the benefits of possible agreement among allies about application of law to facts. Rather, the factual clarity from public attributions helps to foster stability and to avoid conflict among cyberspace adversaries by making clear how states will apply law to facts and what behaviors they will regard as escalatory. Goldsmith and Williams make a separate point that “[p]ublic attribution via indictments and other mechanism without a material response... signal[s] to adversaries... that the United States is extraordinarily defenseless.” *Id.* Although I am somewhat less pessimistic about the utility of public attributions alone, I generally agree that other actions are necessary. Public attributions are a starting point, not the end point, of beginning to limit hostile activity in cyberspace.\nCyberattack Attribution ## II. THE LAW OF ATTRIBUTION Assuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.\n## A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General International law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.¹⁷¹ The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.¹⁷² For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.\nSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide\"clear and convincing\"evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The\"clear and convincing\"standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.\nAlthough the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,¹⁷³ it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.¹⁷⁴ In the 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ's lack of clarity on standards of evidence.¹⁷⁵ She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.”¹⁷⁶ She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear,¹⁷⁷ noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.”¹⁷⁸ Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is... little to help parties... as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”¹⁷⁹ The ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention &amp; Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide.¹⁸⁰ The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”¹⁸¹ In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.”¹⁸² Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense ICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.\".\n\nCyberattack Attribution in particular, its evidentiary standard appears more broadly applicable, adjusting based on the gravity of the offense claimed.\nWhile acknowledging and criticizing the ICJ's failure to resolve the standard of proof required in use of force cases, scholars have argued that the ICJ's case law supports an implied clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard for self defense.¹⁸³ Such a standard is less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard employed in criminal law, and more than a preponderance of the evidence.¹⁸⁴ In essence, a\"clear and convincing\"standard requires\"the party with the burden of proof... [to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.\"¹⁸⁵ Scholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice.¹⁸⁶ Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing\"convincing\"or ¹⁸³. See, e.g., Green, supra note 11, at 172–73 (arguing that a close reading of the ICJ's decisions in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms reveals\"implicit standards of evidence,\"and specifically that the Court applies a\"clear and convincing\"standard of proof for claims of self defense); O'Connell, supra note 171, at 24 (arguing that the ICJ's Nicaragua decision impliedly required convincing evidence); Roscini, supra note 11, at 249–50 (citing ICJ cases and arguing that\"claims related to jus ad bellum violations... have been treated as requiring 'clear and convincing evidence.'\"). But see Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus ad Bellum Revisited, 56 VIII. L. REV. 569, 594 (2011) (\"[I]nternational law sets no specific evidentiary standard for drawing conclusions as to the originator of an armed attack.\"); Tsagourias, supra note 19, at 235 (\"International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.\"). It is unclear the extent to which an implicit\"clear and convincing\"evidence standard may have been disrupted by the Court's decision in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, 2005 I.C.J. 168 (Dec. 19), which appears to use different evidentiary standards throughout the opinion. See Green, supra note 11, at 174–76 (detailing the ICJ's inconsistent use of evidentiary standards, including\"clear and convincing,\"preponderance, and\"prima facie evidence,\"in the DRC v. Uganda case).\n¹⁸⁴. See, e.g., id. at 167 (explaining the hierarchy of evidentiary standards); Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"Clear and compelling\"is a threshold higher than the preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not) standard used in certain civil and administrative proceedings and lower than criminal law's 'beyond a reasonable doubt.').\n¹⁸⁵. Green, supra note 11, at 167. Michael Schmitt equates the standard to a state's duty to act reasonably. Schmitt, supra note 183, at 595 (\"In essence, it obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.\").\n¹⁸⁶. See Green, supra note 11, at 173–74 (noting the practice of the United States in apparently invoking a clear and convincing standard to justify its use of force in self defense and arguing that the standard may\"be an accurate reflection of an embryonic formalist approach to evidence with regard to self-defence claims more generally\").\n\n'compelling' evidence\"to support forcible responses to terrorist attacks, including bombings of Libya in 1986, Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993, and Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998.¹⁸⁷ Perhaps most significantly, the United States appears to have deployed the clear and convincing standard to justify the use of force in self defense after the 9/11 attacks.¹⁸⁸ In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had\"clear and compelling information\"that Al Qaeda\"had a central role in the attacks.\"¹⁸⁹ The\"clear and compelling\"phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO's collective defense provisions.¹⁹⁰ It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that bloc—regard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.¹⁹¹ While the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility—the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.”¹⁹² For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense.¹⁹³ If the most serious international offenses, such as Cyberattack Attribution armed attacks and genocide, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence,¹⁹⁴ then presumably the standard for lesser wrongs is lower. But how much lower?\nState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.”¹⁹⁵ The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”¹⁹⁶ Turning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release.¹⁹⁷ Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions.¹⁹⁸ But some in the cybersecurity community publicly (Feb. 26) (noting that when a state is accused of genocide “the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation”); see also Netherlands Letter, supra note 115, at 7 (“Under international law there is no fixed standard concerning the burden of proof a state must meet for (legal) attribution, and thus far the International Court of Justice has accepted different standards of proof.”).\n¹⁹⁴. See Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 2007 I.C.J. at 129, ¶ 209 (“[C]laims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”).\n¹⁹⁵. Egan, supra note 112, at 177. The Tallinn Manual provides additional gloss on the meaning of reasonableness: “Reasonableness is always context dependent. It depends on such factors as, inter alia, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.” TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 8, at 81–82.\n¹⁹⁶. Wright, supra note 113.\n¹⁹⁷. Press Release, FBI, supra note 58 (citing as evidence supporting its attribution to North Korea, “similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks” to attacks known to have been carried out by North Korea, as well as “significant overlap between the infrastructure used” in the Sony hack and prior attacks “linked directly to North Korea”).\n¹⁹⁸. See, e.g., Press Release, Philip Hammond, Foreign Sec’y, U.K. Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, Foreign Secretary Responds to FBI Reports Into Cyber Attacks on Sony Pictures (Dec. 19, 2014), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-responds-to-fbi-reports-into-cyber-attacks-on-sony-pictures [https://perma.cc/46BN-RG5P] (“I unequivocally condemn these cyber attacks [on Sony] and am deeply concerned at the findings of the US doubted the attribution, criticizing the U.S. government for providing limited and questionable evidence of North Korea's involvement. In response, the FBI released slightly more detailed evidence, citing operational errors by the hackers that revealed their use of internet protocol addresses used solely by North Korea. \nOther attributions have included more details. Attributions-by-indictment in particular have been quite detailed, as have attributions-by-alert.[202] The WannaCry attributions, initially done through official statements,[203] were less detailed, but a subsequent indictment provided additional information.[204] Among the most detailed attributions to date are those to the GRU in October 2018. There, the Dutch investigation produced significant evidence due to the physical presence of the Russian government operatives in the Netherlands,[205] and the U.S. indictment provided considerable detail, particularly with respect to the targeting of worldwide antidoping organizations.[206] As a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.[207] investigation, which seems to provide further evidence of North Korea's blatant disregard for international norms and obligations.\").\n\nCyberattack Attribution However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom. Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and *opinio juris*—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”²⁰⁸ These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.²⁰⁹ Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”²¹⁰ ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least *some* evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.²¹¹ In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the *opinio juris* required for customary international law.\n## B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution Attribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been affected—either because they possess cyber-operation capabilities that others do not, or because they have been the victim of cyber-operations—international law may actually require the community of States to pay particular attention to their views on the state of customary international law.”). Similarities in the types of evidence cited across different attributions might also suggest practical convergence on the *nature* of evidence required. For example, multiple indictments cite information about hackers’ working hours as evidence of their location. See, e.g., Indictment, *supra* note 29, at 12–13 (discussing how hackers’ activity corresponded to working hours in Shanghai); *id.* at 14 (noting that the defendants “typically engaged in hacking operations during working hours in China”).\n²⁰⁸.

The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\n# 1. Why Legalize?\nAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\nGiven that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.[213] Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.[214] And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes Cyberattack Attribution a normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.²¹⁵ States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.²¹⁶ Relegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.²¹⁷ And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\nTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course, the bounds of the prior legal position) but that it is choosing to act in accordance with this particular policy pronouncement.” (footnote omitted)).\n²¹⁵. See Pierre-Hugues Verdier &amp; Erik Voeten, *Precedent, Compliance, and Change in Customary International Law: An Explanatory Theory*, 108 AM. J. INT’L L. 389, 411 (2014) (“[W]hen a state declares that a CIL rule exists, it signals its intent... to apply the rule consistently and universally and to expect others to do so as well.”).\n²¹⁶. Customary international law’s universality is one of the “design features” that makes it an attractive alternative to both treaties and soft law in certain circumstances. See Laurence R. Helfer &amp; Ingrid B. Wuerth, *Customary International Law: An Instrument Choice Perspective*, 37 MICH. J. INT’L L. 563, 568–72 (2016).\n²¹⁷. For those who might doubt whether a government would credit an attribution without reviewing supporting evidence, consider this statement by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attribution of cyberattacks against Georgia to Russia in February 2020: “@CzechMFA condemns cyberattacks on #Georgia from October 28, 2019. While we do not have the primary forensic evidence in this case, we have no reason to doubt the attribution assessment made by our allies.” Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (@CzechMFA), TWITTER (Feb. 20, 2020, 5:55 AM), https://twitter.com/CzechMFA/status/1230491060150964230?s=20 [https://perma.cc/64VL-WUN]; see supra notes 104-106 (discussing attribution of the attacks to Russia).\n\nestablishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state's failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A's attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B's practice because State A's claim about State B's practice would not be credited.\nFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.²¹⁸ This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.²¹⁹ States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.²²⁰ Given these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in\n\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.²²¹ Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\nSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.²²² If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.²²³ Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”²²⁴ Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.²²⁵ Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties' practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states' expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,²²⁶ but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\nThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states' compliance.²²⁷ If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\nFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic\n\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.²³¹ Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn't be required to comply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency²³²—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\nIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states' behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## 2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution If evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as *lex specialis* on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky *lex generalis* of international law on evidence.\n## a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law Some of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.”²³³ A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable Cyberattack Attribution cause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged.²³⁴ The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”²³⁵ The standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme.²³⁶ The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts.²³⁷ A court reviewing a designation “appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action only if it is ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”²³⁸ One might think that domestic law standards are sufficient to govern attributions. In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments—they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing—so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold. But although the domestic law standards are currently doing some of the work that an international law requirement for evidence-giving would do, they are insufficient.\nEven in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court.²³⁹ For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.”²⁴⁰ Other governments use the Cyberattack Attribution same estimative language.²⁴¹ Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.\nEven if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.²⁴² These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures—responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor's prior wrongful act;²⁴³ such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.\nIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions-by-indictment and attributions-by-sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.²⁴⁴ Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards would not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.²⁴⁵ Additionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other's domestic laws. Domestic legal standards—especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate cross-national agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.²⁴⁶ That is the domain of international law.\n## b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution The turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.²⁴⁷ Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\nWhat then should international law say about evidence to support cyberattack attributions?\n\nCyberattack Attribution For the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense—some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.²⁴⁸ For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ's suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.²⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach..., the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response... because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”²⁵⁰ Adopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between—the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states' use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.²⁵¹ Moreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\n\nTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution's credibility.²⁵² Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states' behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\nMoreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,²⁵³ including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decisionmaking ex ante,²⁵⁴ and accountability for decisions ex post.²⁵⁵ The requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may Cyberattack Attribution or may not choose to undertake, unlike the sliding scale approach from the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, which alters the evidence required based on the severity of the attack or anticipated response. The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state's only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\nCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant's APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.[256] CrowdStrike's attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.[257] Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.[258] In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.[259] Defining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.²⁶⁰ Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement's amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.²⁶¹ A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.²⁶² Thus, the crosschecking standard's amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\nAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution.\nConsider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro-level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures.²⁶³ For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution— ROMANOSKY &amp; BOUDREAUX, supra note 41, at 2 (discussing criticism of the U.S. DHS/FBI Joint Analysis Report entitled “GRIZZLYSTEPPE” on hacking related to the 2016 election).\n²⁶⁰. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (“[T]he difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.”); CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., 21B FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE, EVIDENCE § 5122 (2d ed. 2005) (“Attempts to define this [clear and convincing evidence] standard seem to fall flat. Nonetheless, courts keep trying.” (footnotes omitted)).\n²⁶¹. See, e.g., WRIGHT ET AL., supra note 260, § 5122 (discussing the preponderance of the evidence standard in comparison to other evidentiary standards).\n²⁶². See, e.g., McCormick on EVIDENCE 661 (Kenneth S. Broun et al. eds., 7th ed. 2013) (defining “proof by a preponderance” as “proof which leads the jury to find that the existence of the contested fact is more probable than its nonexistence”).\n²⁶³. See supra notes 140–149 and accompanying text (discussing macro-level deterrence).\nCyberattack Attribution and thus the accused state's wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\nCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.²⁶⁴ Particularly with respect to attributions-by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual's criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\nFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.²⁶⁵ If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\nThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\nSome cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.[266] In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.[267] The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state's subsequent countermeasures.\nFor attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.\nImportantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate Cyberattack Attribution international law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states' domestic law.²⁶⁸ In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a *lex specialis* in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,²⁶⁹ setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.²⁷⁰ The process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.²⁷¹ Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.²⁷² Going forward, *all* governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.\n\nThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.²⁷³ That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”²⁷⁴ States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”²⁷⁵ Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.²⁷⁶ This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\nIn addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard.²⁷⁷ Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing Cyberattack Attribution the existence of *opinio juris* for a broad range of states.²⁷⁸ States could also participate in one of the two ongoing U.N. groups devoted to developing international norms for cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts—both of which may issue reports relevant to customary international law.²⁷⁹ Taken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and *opinio juris* reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state's relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.²⁸⁰ Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\nAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence-giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard practice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet²⁸¹ and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.\n*** The paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary *lex specialis*, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.²⁸² Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially *mandating* evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\nThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The *lex specialis* in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into *lex generalis*, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non-cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining Cyberattack Attribution tankers and shooting down a U.S. drone.²⁸³ The potential for *lex specialis* to transform into *lex generalis* raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.\nThe next Part turns from the legal standard for cyberattack attributions to questions of institutional design.\n## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION Setting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\nThis Part first provides an overview of proposals to centralize attribution in a new international entity and then argues for some underappreciated virtues of preserving a measure of decentralization.\nThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments.\nAt one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.²⁸⁴ The Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.”²⁸⁵ The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,”²⁸⁶ and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.²⁸⁷ At the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.²⁸⁸ Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.”²⁸⁹ Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish.²⁹⁰ Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum...representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.”²⁹¹ The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”²⁹² At the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.²⁹³ RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf [https://perma.cc/GQ6M-JBC2].\n\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nThe proposals to centralize attribution respond to problems with the current, decentralized system. Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.[300] Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies' business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.[301] An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.\nAnother set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often the same threat actors. For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.”³⁰² Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.”³⁰³ It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches… and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”³⁰⁴ Finally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.”³⁰⁵ This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.³⁰⁶ An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.³⁰⁷ This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\n\nCyberattack Attribution The proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model.\nFirst, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that\"attribution is nearly impossible.\"308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\nSecond, an international attribution entity would likely be resource-constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.[309] A new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity's access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some governments out may exacerbate the perception that the entity's attributions are politicized or that its choice of cases to investigate is skewed.³¹⁰ All of these challenges suggest that while there is value to creating an entity in some form, it should become an additional participant in the current decentralized attribution system—centralization within decentralization as it were. This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decisionmaking bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).³¹¹ An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.³¹² But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.³¹³ The decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.³¹⁴ First, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,³¹⁵ the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,³¹⁶ but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed\n\nCyberattack Attribution\n\nSecond, decentralization can foster transparency about states' actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.\nNumerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.³¹⁷ For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.³¹⁸ Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.³¹⁹ By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike's claim.³²⁰ These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.³²¹ Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,³²² and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.³²³ The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated attribution campaign in October 2018. If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.\nThird, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies' marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies' business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.[325] An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.\nDecentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,[326] some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.\nFourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors' competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others—an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.[327] It has also resulted in some Cyberattack Attribution attempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.³²⁸ After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,³²⁹ and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.³³⁰ To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.³³¹ But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.\nAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\nFinally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases ³²⁸. Tal Kopan, U.S.: No Alternate Leads in Sony Hack, POLITICO (Dec. 29, 2014, 7:41 PM), https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/fbi-briefed-on-alternate-sony-hack-theory-113866 [https://perma.cc/6DBV-PY8P]; see also Egloff, supra note 164, at 65–66 (discussing contestation of the Sony hack attribution to North Korea).\n³²⁹. See Kopan, supra note 328.\n³³⁰. See supra note 201 and accompanying text (describing speech by James Comey providing additional details).\n³³¹. See, e.g., CHARNEY ET AL., supra note 289, at 12.\n\nmay be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,³³² but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.\nThe ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.\nAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.³³³ As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), ³³². See, e.g., DAVIS II ET AL., supra note 22, at 19 (arguing that a “standing attribution entit[y]” would be better positioned to track threat actors over time than are “independent investigators coalescing in ad hoc cases”).\n³³³. Cf. Press Release, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, U.S. Dep’t of State, Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats (May 31, 2018), https://www.state.gov/recommendations-to-the-president-on-deterring-adversaries-and-better-protecting-the-american-people-from-cyber-threats [https://perma.cc/34PN-YZGG] (discussing deterrence of cyberattacks and noting that “[p]artner states could, on a voluntary basis, support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken following an incident, and/or actual participation in the imposition of consequences against perpetrator governments”).\nCyberattack Attribution plus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.³³⁴ The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states' behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\nImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\n## CONCLUSION Cyberattack attributions aren't just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states' domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states' actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\n³³⁴ Cf. Wright, supra note 113 (“If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can be more certain of the assessment.”).\nImproving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states' behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.\n."

    "abstract": "Attribution of cyberattacks requires identifying those responsible for bad acts, prominently including states, and accurate attribution is a crucial predicate in contexts as diverse as criminal indictments, insurance coverage disputes, and cyberwar. But the difficult technical side of attribution is just the precursor to highly contested legal and policy questions about when and how to accuse governments of responsibility for cyberattacks. Although politics may largely determine whether attributions are made public, this Article argues that when cyberattacks are publicly attributed to states, such attributions should be governed by legal standards. Instead of blocking the development of evidentiary standards for attribution, as the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are currently doing, states should establish an international law requirement that public attributions must include sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the accusations. This functionally-defined standard harnesses both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to shed light on states' activities in cyberspace, and understanding state practice is a necessary precondition to establishing norms and customary international law to govern state behavior. Moreover, setting a clear evidentiary standard for cyberattack attribution has the potential to clarify currently unsettled general international law rules on evidence. This Article also engages debates about institutional design for attributing cyberattacks. Companies and think tanks have made several recent proposals for the creation of an international entity that would handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, this Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the goals that attributors aim to achieve, namely, strengthening defenses, deterring attacks, and improving stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace.",
