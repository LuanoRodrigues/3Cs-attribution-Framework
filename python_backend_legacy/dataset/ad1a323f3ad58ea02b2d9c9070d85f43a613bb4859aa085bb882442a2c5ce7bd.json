Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\n\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal-\n\n† Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.”¹ These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.”² The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\n\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\n\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\n\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.³\n\n¹ Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n² Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n³ I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here.

In a recent book, Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina bridge the gap between consequentialist and deontological moral theories—which tracks a similar gap between instrumental and non-instrumental logic—by imposing threshold conditions on social welfare functions.⁴ As I explain in greater detail in Part II, by using Zamir and Medina’s deontologically constrained cost-benefit analysis (“constrained CBA”) approach, scholars are better able to explain and understand complex bodies of law that are the product of instrumental and non-instrumental concerns alike.⁵\n\nIn the second half of the paper, I apply the constrained CBA approach to examine the emerging substantive problem of cyberwar. I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n\n### A. Standard Account\n\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.⁶\n\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n\n⁴ See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n\n⁵ Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n\n⁶ This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Enlightened states in an enlightened era recognized the importance of limiting war's primary effects to military targets. Early multilateral statements to this effect emphasized that “the progress of civilization should have the effect of alleviating as much as possible the calamities of war,” accomplished by states placing noncombatants off-limits and seeking only to “weaken the military forces of the enemy.”¹¹ The Lieber Code made clear that “military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge.”¹²\n\nHaving crystallized over the years, these ideas find expression today at all levels of generality in the law of armed conflict. They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects,¹³ prohibiting perfidy,¹⁴ prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants,¹⁵ or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons,¹⁶ to name only a few.\n\ninterests but also humanitarian interests.

These intransgressible principles¹⁷ have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds.¹⁸ The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL.¹⁹ Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\"²⁰ To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants.²¹ Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"²²\n\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism.

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV²⁷), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.”²⁸ In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\n\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n\n²⁴ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n²⁵ The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n²⁶ Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL).

IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\n\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use.²⁹ States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.³⁰\n\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way.

The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest.³⁴ Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.³⁵\n\n## B. Rationalist Account\n\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness).³⁶ Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n\n³² Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n³³ See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n³⁴ Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n³⁵ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n³⁶ See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\n\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying.³⁸ On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"³⁹\n\n³⁷ See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004).

States' obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties, and under certain rules of customary international law, turn in part on whether other parties (or states recognizing the custom) are holding up their end of the bargain.⁴⁰ Reciprocity norms also existed in strong form during the early periods of humanitarian law reform, although it is an open question whether state practice recognizes those norms as viable today.⁴¹ Either way, scholars continue to defend the reciprocity thesis today. As Eric Posner explains,\n\n“states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”⁴²\n\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality.⁴³ The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do.

Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries.⁴⁸ By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect.

UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\n\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis.⁴⁹ In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\n\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant.⁵⁰ It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n\n⁴⁹ See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n\n⁵⁰ See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents.

As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\n\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations.

The Positive Theory\n\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n\n51 Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 43 (cited in note 5) (suggesting that different commentators or analysts will set this threshold breaking-point at different points along the spectrum of consequences).

Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\n\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\n\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n\n55 On the imperfect nature of some customary rules, see Theodor Meron, The Geneva Conventions as Customary Law, 81–2 Am J Intl L 348 (1987).\n\n56 UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 68 (UK Ministry of Defence 2004).

Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\n\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\n\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n\n59 See, for example, James Fearon, Rationalist Explanations for War, 49 Intl Org 379 (1995).\n\n60 For simplicity I assume that in an international armed conflict a state's citizens will prefer the bundle of goods that the state provides to the bundle that the enemy state would provide. I also bracket the question of non-international armed conflicts, see Additional Protocol II, and international armed conflicts involving fights \"against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist régimes,\" Additional Protocol I, Art 1.4. These two latter types of conflicts will usually involve an internal market for public goods where some non-negligible segment of the population prefers insurgents' bundle of goods to the status quo regime's bundle of goods.\n\n61 See Gideon Parchomovsky and Peter Siegelman, Bribes vs. bombs: A Study in Coasean Warfare, 29 Intl Rev of L &amp; Econ 179, 180 (2009), quoting Robert Powell, War as a Commitment Problem, 60 Intl Org 169, 169 (2006) (\"[T]he pie to be divided after the fighting begins is smaller than it was before the war started. This means that there are usually divisions of the larger pie that would have given each belligerent more than it will have after the fighting.

The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\n\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another.

On the other hand, Kevin Narizny has challenged this traditional idea, noting that for ideological reasons domestic political coalitions may see guns and butter not as substitutes but rather as complementary goods.

This objection is largely unconvincing because it collapses first-order preferences for satisfying self-interest with second-order preferences for rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest by introducing absolute or threshold constraints against certain outcomes. Moreover, the objection is methodologically suspect, for it assumes away the existence of endogenous non-instrumental reasons for preferring rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest.\n\n66 See note 8 and accompanying text.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.⁶⁸\n\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.⁶⁹\n\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital.

Optimism biases and other strong preferences (like in-group preferences, which favor fellow countrymen over enemies) may lead battlefield decisionmakers to overestimate the expected value of the risky tail. Such biases may also lead them to maximize short-term military advantage while discounting the risk that such decisions would be detrimental to long-term interests or would violate a threshold constraint.70 By contrast, situation-room decisionmakers are unlikely to be as susceptible to the fog of war; with their macro-level perspective they are perhaps more likely to be risk averse. They are also more likely than their battlefield counterparts to show elasticity with regard to the cost of potential humanitarian casualties, or to prefer threshold constraints against such casualties. All else equal, states' preferences are likely to track the preferences of their situation-room decisionmakers rather than their battlefield decisionmakers, if only because the former group is institutionally closer to, and thus theoretically more in line with, the views of foreign policy elites and international lawyers who interpret treaties and execute the state practice of custom.\n\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n\n70 Consider in this sense rules limiting perfidy, or the debate about “double-tapping” combatants who appear to be dead. See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 327–30 (cited in note 8). Such tactics might maximize short-term battlefield interests, albeit at the expense of longer-term interests (threat of reciprocal perfidy in future armed conflict) or the violation of threshold constraints (killing enemy combatants rather than checking whether they are alive but rendered hors de combat and thus entitled to be detained).\n\n71 See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 302 (cited in note 2) (“[T]he discrimination principle … requires a military force to take losses rather than inflict too much harm on civilians and civilian property … thus increasing the cost of achieving a given objective”). The same can be said about rules against no-quarter declarations, since detaining prisoners is more costly than killing them outright. See id, citing Morrow, 55 Intl Org at 979 (cited in note 46). If double-tapping practices are forms of no-quarter practices, see note 70, then attempts to constrain double-tapping similarly increase short-term battlefield costs but decrease not only longer-term reciprocal costs but also the likelihood that threshold constraints against killing combatants rendered hors de combat.\n\n72 Combined with cost-reduction preferences, see text between notes 61 and 63, these effects may lead states to purchase offensive and defensive capabilities from private military contractors (PMCs), which may be (but are not necessarily) Pareto superior to organized armed\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\n\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure.

Technology in the Laws of War\n\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\n\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\n\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n\n76 See Robert Jervis, Cooperation under the Security Dilemma, 30 World Politics 167, 169 (1978) (describing this spiral model).

Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar.⁷⁹ Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways.⁸⁰ A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\n\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles.

The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n\n⁷⁸ See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n\n⁷⁹ See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n\n⁸⁰ See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”⁸² While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage.⁸³ The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.⁸⁴\n\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems.⁸⁵ I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation.⁸⁶ Consider the fol-\n\n⁸¹ See generally id.

It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n\n⁸⁴ See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare.

The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n\n1. Distinction.\n\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n\n92 Id at 17–21.

Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\n\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n\n96 Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 68 (cited in note 11).

A strong case could be made that the state would have violated the customary prohibition against weapons that cannot discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. If it designed cyber weapons with the goal of targeting civilian systems, the case for state responsibility would be even clearer.\n\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected.¹⁰² However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\n\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,”¹⁰³ would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\n\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n\n¹⁰² Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants.

Dual use targets.\n\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”¹⁰⁵ Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining.¹⁰⁶ For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”¹⁰⁷\n\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.”¹⁰⁸ Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n\n¹⁰⁴ Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n\n¹⁰⁵ Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2).

[like] loss of support for a regime.\"¹⁰⁹ States that substitute toward these latter kinds of effect-based operations thus face tough legal dilemmas about whether the collateral consequences of targeting decisions are proportionate to the military advantage gained. Moreover, they must be careful to tailor the goals of their effects-based operations, since customary IHL rules disapprove states' attempts to use targeting decisions to “‘forc[e] a change in the negotiating attitudes’ of the enemy” or achieve other “political outcome[s].”¹¹⁰\n\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers.¹¹¹ The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack.¹¹² Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems.¹¹³ One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\n\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants.¹¹⁴ States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n\n¹⁰⁹ Id at 60, 62.\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹¹ Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n¹¹² See id.\n¹¹³ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25).

Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁶ But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁷\n\n## 3. Direct participation\n\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”¹¹⁸ As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,”¹¹⁹ the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.”¹²⁰ This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n\n¹¹⁵ Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n\n¹¹⁶ By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n\n¹¹⁷ This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n\n¹¹⁸ Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n\n¹¹⁹ Id at 96.\n\n¹²⁰ Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button,¹²² but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet¹²³ without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces.¹²⁴ Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\n\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.”¹²⁵ In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n\n¹²¹ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n¹²² See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n¹²³ See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n¹²⁴ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n¹²⁵ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat¹²⁸ apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n\n¹²⁶ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n¹²⁷ Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n¹²⁸ See note 25.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal-\n† Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.”¹ These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.”² The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.³\n¹ Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n² Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n³ I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here. See generally Roger Alford and James Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law, in Donald\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n3\nEven bracketing this psychological approach, which is kindred with recent advances in behavioral law and economics, scholars have also developed an economic framework for analyzing non-instrumental constraints on instrumental logic. In a recent book, Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina bridge the gap between consequentialist and deontological moral theories—which tracks a similar gap between instrumental and non-instrumental logic—by imposing threshold conditions on social welfare functions.⁴ As I explain in greater detail in Part II, by using Zamir and Medina’s deontologically constrained cost-benefit analysis (“constrained CBA”) approach, scholars are better able to explain and understand complex bodies of law that are the product of instrumental and non-instrumental concerns alike.⁵\nIn the second half of the paper, I apply the constrained CBA approach to examine the emerging substantive problem of cyberwar. I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n### A. Standard Account\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.⁶\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n⁴ See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n⁵ Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n⁶ This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nNatural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime.

Enlightened states in an enlightened era recognized the importance of limiting war's primary effects to military targets. Early multilateral statements to this effect emphasized that “the progress of civilization should have the effect of alleviating as much as possible the calamities of war,” accomplished by states placing noncombatants off-limits and seeking only to “weaken the military forces of the enemy.”¹¹ The Lieber Code made clear that “military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge.”¹²\nHaving crystallized over the years, these ideas find expression today at all levels of generality in the law of armed conflict. They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects,¹³ prohibiting perfidy,¹⁴ prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants,¹⁵ or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons,¹⁶ to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests.

These intransgressible principles¹⁷ have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds.¹⁸ The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL.¹⁹ Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\"²⁰ To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants.²¹ Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"²²\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants.²³ The principle of dis\n¹⁷ See Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1996 ICJ Rep 226, 257 (reducing the rules of IHL to the two \"intransgressible\" principles of distinction and avoiding unnecessary suffering).\n¹⁸ Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 299 (cited in note 2).

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV²⁷), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.”²⁸ In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n²⁴ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n²⁵ The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n²⁶ Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21). For “rules of the game,” see note 31 and accompanying text.\n²⁷ See Rupert Ticehurst, The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict, 317 Intl Rev of the Red Cross 125 (1997).\n²⁸ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 9 (cited in note 11). But see Eric Posner, *Terrorism and the Laws of War*, 5 Chi J Intl L 423, 427 (2005) (“[T]he ideal of humanitarianism does not explain why some weapons and tactics are outlawed and others are not.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nyears, so has that development process been sensitive to pragmatic concerns about waging effective war. IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use.²⁹ States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.³⁰\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that\n“the law of war allows ... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”³¹\n²⁹ See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105 (Jan-Feb 1973).\n³⁰ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24 (Cornell 1996).

According to the Nuremberg Tribunal’s judgment in the Hostage case, with regard to such rules “[m]ilitary necessity or expediency do not justify a violation.”³² Yet IHL plainly recognizes other circumstances in which military necessity is properly balanced against other interests. Consider how military necessity permits combatants to kill innocent noncombatants if proportionality threshold constraints are met.³³\nUnder the standard account, therefore, IHL rules are designed to serve not only humanitarian but also pragmatic interests. The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest.³⁴ Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.³⁵\n## B. Rationalist Account\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness).³⁶ Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n³² Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n³³ See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n³⁴ Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n³⁵ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n³⁶ See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nhave put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest.³⁷ Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying.³⁸ On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"³⁹\n³⁷ See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004). Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n³⁸ See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n³⁹ Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”). See Solis, *Law of Armed Conflict* at 10 (cited in\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n11\nThe reciprocity thesis has a strong pedigree in the history of international law. States' obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties, and under certain rules of customary international law, turn in part on whether other parties (or states recognizing the custom) are holding up their end of the bargain.⁴⁰ Reciprocity norms also existed in strong form during the early periods of humanitarian law reform, although it is an open question whether state practice recognizes those norms as viable today.⁴¹ Either way, scholars continue to defend the reciprocity thesis today. As Eric Posner explains,\n“states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”⁴²\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality.⁴³ The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game. Other times state practice does not re\nnote 8) (“We obey the law of war if for no other reason than because reciprocity tells us that what goes around comes around...”) (emphasis added). See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation. See Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works 33–38 (Oxford 2008).\n⁴⁰ See Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 370–82 (cited in note 38).\n⁴¹ See id at 417–30.\n⁴² Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). See also Posner, manuscript at *6 (cited in note 38) (“Rules that make states jointly better off in one war but not in another war may be respected in the first war but will not be respected in the second. ... When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n⁴³ Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nsemble such games.⁴⁴ Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.⁴⁵\nIts weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be⁴⁶), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.”⁴⁷ States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries.⁴⁸ By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc\n⁴⁴ See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (Harvard 1994) (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n⁴⁵ See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n⁴⁶ Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem. Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). This is known as the tit-for-tat strategy. Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added). In light of that scholarly tradition, Posner’s adherence to the tit-for-tat posture is puzzling.\n⁴⁷ Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 368 (cited in note 38); id at 431 (“[S]tate practice vindicates the claim that states’ insistence on reciprocity has subsided over time.”).\n⁴⁸ See James Morrow, When Do States Follow the Laws of War? 101 Am Pol Sci Rev 559, 570 (2007) (“States then are more likely to comply with the laws of war when they have internalized those laws in their military training and [military] justice. These mechanisms increase compliance by strengthening reciprocity by reducing noise.”); David Kennedy, Of War and Law 32 (Princeton 2006) (“Military professionals also have desires for law. For starters, they also turn to law to limit the violence of warfare, to ensure some safety, some decency, among professionals on different sides of the conflict.”); Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 10 (cited in note 8) (noting the reciprocity thesis, but noting that “[w]e obey the law of war because it is the law and because it is the honourable path for a nation that holds itself up as a protector of oppressed peoples”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n13\nity thesis means its explanatory force is weaker than what a more complete account might provide.\n## II. UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis.⁴⁹ In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides.

They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* (Oxford 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n51 Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 43 (cited in note 5) (suggesting that different commentators or analysts will set this threshold breaking-point at different points along the spectrum of consequences). While scholars such as Blum have begun to employ threshold deontology in the analysis of IHL rules, this paper appears to be the first to address these rules using constrained CBA.\n52 Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* at 74 (cited in note 4).\n53 See Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 68 (cited in note 5) (“[T]he current system of [international humanitarian law] is neither purely deontological—for it makes numerous concessions in allowing wars to be fought in the first place—nor purely consequentialist—for it prohibits certain actions even when those might produce less suffering in totality.”).\n54 Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 161 (cited in note 11) (“[IHL] imposes a general obligation to accept the surrender of enemy combatants who clearly express an intention do so.”). See Additional Protocol I, Art 40 (forbidding state practice or threats of a no-quarter policy); Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Art 8(2)(b)(xii) (making it a crime to “declar[e] that no quarter will be given”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n15\nlute.” This term covers not only jus cogens norms, but also norms for which opinio juris or state practice generally strikes the balance in favor of humanitarian consideration (but for which persistent objectors or other factors mean they are not “absolute”).55\nOther times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n55 On the imperfect nature of some customary rules, see Theodor Meron, The Geneva Conventions as Customary Law, 81–2 Am J Intl L 348 (1987).\n56 UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 68 (UK Ministry of Defence 2004). See Additional Protocol I, Art 51(8). See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 155 (cited in note 11) (“Customary international law is certainly more rigorous than Additional Protocol I on this point.”).\n57 See Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–68 (cited in note 21). See generally Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 1 (cited in note 5).\n58 Walzer quotes Truman’s Secretary of War as describing the overwhelming consequentialist justification for targeting two Japanese urban centers with atomic weapons: “No man, in our position and subject to our responsibilities, holding in his hand a weapon of such possibilities for … saving [the] lives,” not just of American soldiers dying in the Pacific but the hundreds of thousands of Japanese who would otherwise die in an invasion of the Japanese mainland, “could have failed to use it.” Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 267 (cited in note 21), quoting The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb, Harpers Magazine (Feb 1947), reprinted in Paul Baker, ed, The Atomic Bomb: The Great Decision 21 (1968).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nStates facing an international conflict have a menu of options to choose from. For our purposes the two important options are bargaining and going to war. Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n59 See, for example, James Fearon, Rationalist Explanations for War, 49 Intl Org 379 (1995).\n60 For simplicity I assume that in an international armed conflict a state's citizens will prefer the bundle of goods that the state provides to the bundle that the enemy state would provide. I also bracket the question of non-international armed conflicts, see Additional Protocol II, and international armed conflicts involving fights \"against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist régimes,\" Additional Protocol I, Art 1.4. These two latter types of conflicts will usually involve an internal market for public goods where some non-negligible segment of the population prefers insurgents' bundle of goods to the status quo regime's bundle of goods.\n61 See Gideon Parchomovsky and Peter Siegelman, Bribes vs. bombs: A Study in Coasean Warfare, 29 Intl Rev of L &amp; Econ 179, 180 (2009), quoting Robert Powell, War as a Commitment Problem, 60 Intl Org 169, 169 (2006) (\"[T]he pie to be divided after the fighting begins is smaller than it was before the war started. This means that there are usually divisions of the larger pie that would have given each belligerent more than it will have after the fighting. Fighting, therefore, leads to a Pareto inferior or inefficient outcome.\"). This is not to mention that war may be undesirable for reasons other than Pareto inferiority, including deontological constraints against \"us[ing] force to resist, punish, or prevent [further] violence.\" Jan Narveson, Pacifism: A Philosophical Analysis, 75 Ethics 259, 259 (1965).\n62 See Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 141 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n17\nquences (as when the state substitutes away from welfare expenditures in favor of war expenditures).63 Cost reduction strategies may also manifest on the back end, such as by selecting policies, tactics, and rules of engagement that recoup fixed costs of procurement and maintenance by increasing the marginal military advantage gained when a soldier fires his gun, a pilot drops a bomb, or a unit captures a POW.\nIt is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that\n63 This is the tradeoff between purchasing guns or butter. On the other hand, Kevin Narizny has challenged this traditional idea, noting that for ideological reasons domestic political coalitions may see guns and butter not as substitutes but rather as complementary goods. See Kevin Narizny, *Both Guns and Butter*, or *Neither: Class Interests in the Political Economy of Rearmament*, 97 Am Pol Sci Rev 203 (2003).\n64 See Walzer, *Just and Unjust Wars* at 262 (cited in note 21) (“[S]uch calculations need not be concerned only with the preservation of life. There is much else that we might plausibly want to preserve: the quality of our lives, for example, our civilization and morality, our collective abhorrence of murder, even when it seems, as it always does, to serve some purpose.”).\n65 Some rationalists might object here that a preference for deontological constraints is really just an interest, making the analysis no different from that offered by standard consequentialism. This objection is largely unconvincing because it collapses first-order preferences for satisfying self-interest with second-order preferences for rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest by introducing absolute or threshold constraints against certain outcomes. Moreover, the objection is methodologically suspect, for it assumes away the existence of endogenous non-instrumental reasons for preferring rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest.\n66 See note 8 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nimplement first-order threshold constraints.⁶⁷ Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.⁶⁸\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.⁶⁹\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount\n⁶⁷ See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n⁶⁸ See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n⁶⁹ Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n19\nof uncertainty in the risky tail. Optimism biases and other strong preferences (like in-group preferences, which favor fellow countrymen over enemies) may lead battlefield decisionmakers to overestimate the expected value of the risky tail. Such biases may also lead them to maximize short-term military advantage while discounting the risk that such decisions would be detrimental to long-term interests or would violate a threshold constraint.70 By contrast, situation-room decisionmakers are unlikely to be as susceptible to the fog of war; with their macro-level perspective they are perhaps more likely to be risk averse. They are also more likely than their battlefield counterparts to show elasticity with regard to the cost of potential humanitarian casualties, or to prefer threshold constraints against such casualties. All else equal, states' preferences are likely to track the preferences of their situation-room decisionmakers rather than their battlefield decisionmakers, if only because the former group is institutionally closer to, and thus theoretically more in line with, the views of foreign policy elites and international lawyers who interpret treaties and execute the state practice of custom.\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n70 Consider in this sense rules limiting perfidy, or the debate about “double-tapping” combatants who appear to be dead. See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 327–30 (cited in note 8). Such tactics might maximize short-term battlefield interests, albeit at the expense of longer-term interests (threat of reciprocal perfidy in future armed conflict) or the violation of threshold constraints (killing enemy combatants rather than checking whether they are alive but rendered hors de combat and thus entitled to be detained).\n71 See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 302 (cited in note 2) (“[T]he discrimination principle … requires a military force to take losses rather than inflict too much harm on civilians and civilian property … thus increasing the cost of achieving a given objective”). The same can be said about rules against no-quarter declarations, since detaining prisoners is more costly than killing them outright. See id, citing Morrow, 55 Intl Org at 979 (cited in note 46). If double-tapping practices are forms of no-quarter practices, see note 70, then attempts to constrain double-tapping similarly increase short-term battlefield costs but decrease not only longer-term reciprocal costs but also the likelihood that threshold constraints against killing combatants rendered hors de combat.\n72 Combined with cost-reduction preferences, see text between notes 61 and 63, these effects may lead states to purchase offensive and defensive capabilities from private military contractors (PMCs), which may be (but are not necessarily) Pareto superior to organized armed\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74\nRules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Cornell 2003).\n73 Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 301 (cited in note 2).\n74 Id. For more on the wasteful nature of expenditures, see note 61 and accompanying text.\n75 Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 305 (cited in note 2) (describing rules limiting destructive effects, such as limits on “weapons that cause devastating wounds, on mines and other weapons whose dangerousness persists after the conflict ends, and on weapons that cause significant environmental harm”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n21\n# A. Technology in the Laws of War\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n76 See Robert Jervis, Cooperation under the Security Dilemma, 30 World Politics 167, 169 (1978) (describing this spiral model). See also Charles Glaser, The Security Dilemma Revisited, 50 World Pol 171 (1997); Brian Frederking, Resolving Security Dilemmas: A constructivist explanation of the INF treaty (Ashgate 2000).\n77 Thomas Wingfield, The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace 3 (Aegis 2000). See Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Art 25 (1907), reprinted in Dietrich Schindler and Jiri Toman, eds, The Laws of Armed Conflict 55, 74 (Martinus Nijhoff 4th rev ed 2004). See also Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 67–88 (cited in note 11) (describing attempts to ban, limit, and regulate the use of specific weapons through history); Henckaerts and Doswald-Beck, Volume 1 at 237–98 (cited in note 13) (describing customary international law restrictions on specific weapons).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\naffect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.⁷⁸\nAs the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar.⁷⁹ Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways.⁸⁰ A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n⁷⁸ See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n⁷⁹ See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n⁸⁰ See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n23\ninsecure, opening them to the risk of exploitation or damage by a network owner's adversaries, criminals, or other malefactors.⁸¹\nAs concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”⁸² While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage.⁸³ The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.⁸⁴\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems.⁸⁵ I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation.⁸⁶ Consider the fol-\n⁸¹ See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64 (Brookings 2000).\n⁸² Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n⁸³ See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n⁸⁴ See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n⁸⁵ See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n⁸⁶ Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁸⁷ Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.⁸⁸\nCyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.”⁸⁹ To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all.⁹⁰ (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats.⁹¹ Even when states are able to deter\ntionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n87 See Schaap, 64 Air Force L Rev at 134–35 (cited in note 79).\n88 Id at 135–37.\n89 Compare note 90. I do not mean to suggest that cybercrime and cyberespionage are not serious. Indeed, cyberespionage can set the stage for later network attacks, serving as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where they key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.” Christopher Joyner and Catherine Lotrione, Information Warfare as International Coercion: Elements of a Legal Framework, 12 Eur J Intl L 825, 841 n 60 (2001).

Michael Schmitt has offered a six-part test to determine whether a cyber attack has occurred for jus ad bellum purposes; further discussion of these criteria is outside the scope of this paper. See Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Colum J Transnational L 887, 914–16 (1999) (enumerating these criteria as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy). Compare Wingfield, Information Conflict at 365 (cited in note 77) (offering the simpler conclusion that “[a]most any computer network attack that intentionally causes almost any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is probably … an armed attack”). For more on the difficulty of determining whether an attack has occurred, and who the attacker might be, see David A. Wheeler and Gregory N. Larsen, Techniques for Cyber Attack Attribution (Institute for Defense Analyses Paper P-3792) (October 2003), available online at http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA468859.\n91 The recent vintage of cyberwarfare technology makes it a prototypical “current” threat. For example, the United States’ strategy document on cyberwarfare remains classified.

The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n1. Distinction.\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n92 Id at 17–21.

Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n96 Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 68 (cited in note 11). Recognizing this principle, the International Court of Justice has instructed states \"never [to] use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets.\" Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n97 See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 68, 71 (cited in note 11).\n98 Id at 83-86.\n99 See Holly Porteous, The Stuxnet Worm: Just Another Computer Attack or a Game Changer?

A strong case could be made that the state would have violated the customary prohibition against weapons that cannot discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. If it designed cyber weapons with the goal of targeting civilian systems, the case for state responsibility would be even clearer.\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected.¹⁰² However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,”¹⁰³ would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n¹⁰² Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n¹⁰³ Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nemploy the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants.¹⁰⁴ Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”¹⁰⁵ Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining.¹⁰⁶ For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”¹⁰⁷\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.”¹⁰⁸ Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n¹⁰⁴ Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n¹⁰⁵ Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2). See Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 90 (cited in note 11) (noting this is customary law), citing Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, *Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims* (2005), 45 ILM 396, 418 (2006).\n¹⁰⁶ Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 92–96 (cited in note 11)\n¹⁰⁷ Id at 105.\n¹⁰⁸ Michael Schmitt, *Targeting and Humanitarian Law: Current Issues*, 34 Israel Yearbook on Hum Rts 59, 60 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n29\nand/or displaced second- and third-order consequences of military action ... [like] loss of support for a regime.\"¹⁰⁹ States that substitute toward these latter kinds of effect-based operations thus face tough legal dilemmas about whether the collateral consequences of targeting decisions are proportionate to the military advantage gained. Moreover, they must be careful to tailor the goals of their effects-based operations, since customary IHL rules disapprove states' attempts to use targeting decisions to “‘forc[e] a change in the negotiating attitudes’ of the enemy” or achieve other “political outcome[s].”¹¹⁰\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers.¹¹¹ The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack.¹¹² Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems.¹¹³ One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants.¹¹⁴ States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n¹⁰⁹ Id at 60, 62.\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹¹ Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n¹¹² See id.\n¹¹³ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25). The United States does not recognize as customary law the “negative presumption that would bar attack” in cases of “object[s] normally dedicated to civilian purposes,” in the absence of evidence that it was actually used for military purposes. Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 98 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹⁴ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 197–231 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\npower.”¹¹⁵ If state practice is consistent in this area, Clarke is correct to suggest that a state might try to target nationwide infrastructure (especially communications networks, top-tier internet service providers, and other systems), although given proportionality constraints his analysis still seems overly pessimistic. Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁶ But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁷\n## 3. Direct participation\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”¹¹⁸ As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,”¹¹⁹ the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.”¹²⁰ This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n¹¹⁵ Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n¹¹⁶ By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n¹¹⁷ This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n¹¹⁸ Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n¹¹⁹ Id at 96.\n¹²⁰ Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n31\ntween the activity engaged in and the harm done to the enemy at the time and the place where the activity takes place.”¹²¹\nIn normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button,¹²² but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet¹²³ without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces.¹²⁴ Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.”¹²⁵ In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n¹²¹ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n¹²² See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n¹²³ See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n¹²⁴ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n¹²⁵ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\ntainly would have still taken place).¹²⁶ Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.¹²⁷\nOptimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat¹²⁸ apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n¹²⁶ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n¹²⁷ Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n¹²⁸ See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n33\nanticipated military action. In some contexts balancing and proportionality matter, yet in other contexts “the ends justify the means” arguments fall upon deaf ears. States (and jurists) will continue to propose and to make institutional design choices for the foreseeable future. They are likely to take such constraints into account even when they serve legitimate consequentialist concerns about the necessity of neutralizing active military threats.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal-\n† Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

Thanks to Aziz Huq. This is a working draft; readers’ comments are welcomed at tierney@uchicago.edu.\nTierney\n[2011\nling into two parallel approaches. On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.” These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.” The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.\n Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here.

I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n### A. Standard Account\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nNatural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime. States have settled on a system of rules recognizing not only that war continues to exist as an institution of international society,10 but\ntures.\" Oona Hathaway and Ariel Lavinbuk, Rationalism and Revisionism in International Law, 119 Harv L Rev 1404, 1411 (2006).

They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects, prohibiting perfidy, prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants, or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons, to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests.

These intransgressible principles have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds. The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL. Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\" To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants. Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants.

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.” In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21). For “rules of the game,” see note 31 and accompanying text.\n See Rupert Ticehurst, The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict, 317 Intl Rev of the Red Cross 125 (1997).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 9 (cited in note 11). But see Eric Posner, *Terrorism and the Laws of War*, 5 Chi J Intl L 423, 427 (2005) (“[T]he ideal of humanitarianism does not explain why some weapons and tactics are outlawed and others are not.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nyears, so has that development process been sensitive to pragmatic concerns about waging effective war. IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use. States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that\n“the law of war allows ... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”\n See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105 (Jan-Feb 1973).\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24 (Cornell 1996).

The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest. Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.\n## B. Rationalist Account\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness). Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nhave put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest. Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying. On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"\n See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004). Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”). See Solis, *Law of Armed Conflict* at 10 (cited in\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\n“states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality. The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game. Other times state practice does not re\nnote 8) (“We obey the law of war if for no other reason than because reciprocity tells us that what goes around comes around...”) (emphasis added). See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation. See Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works 33–38 (Oxford 2008).\n See Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 370–82 (cited in note 38).\n See id at 417–30.\n Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). See also Posner, manuscript at *6 (cited in note 38) (“Rules that make states jointly better off in one war but not in another war may be respected in the first war but will not be respected in the second. ... When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nsemble such games. Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.\nIts weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.” States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries. By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc\n See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (Harvard 1994) (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem. Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). This is known as the tit-for-tat strategy. Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added). In light of that scholarly tradition, Posner’s adherence to the tit-for-tat posture is puzzling.\n Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 368 (cited in note 38); id at 431 (“[S]tate practice vindicates the claim that states’ insistence on reciprocity has subsided over time.”).\n See James Morrow, When Do States Follow the Laws of War? 101 Am Pol Sci Rev 559, 570 (2007) (“States then are more likely to comply with the laws of war when they have internalized those laws in their military training and [military] justice. These mechanisms increase compliance by strengthening reciprocity by reducing noise.”); David Kennedy, Of War and Law 32 (Princeton 2006) (“Military professionals also have desires for law. For starters, they also turn to law to limit the violence of warfare, to ensure some safety, some decency, among professionals on different sides of the conflict.”); Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 10 (cited in note 8) (noting the reciprocity thesis, but noting that “[w]e obey the law of war because it is the law and because it is the honourable path for a nation that holds itself up as a protector of oppressed peoples”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\n## II. UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis. In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant. It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents. Thus, consequentialism arguably requires that we harvest the organs of one person to save the lives of two other people, that we torture the baby of a terrorist to force him to reveal information that may save lives, and so forth.”). They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* (Oxford 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nOther times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nStates facing an international conflict have a menu of options to choose from. For our purposes the two important options are bargaining and going to war. Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIt is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nimplement first-order threshold constraints. Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount\n See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74\nRules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Cornell 2003).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\naffect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.\nAs the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar. Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways. A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAs concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage. The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems. I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation. Consider the fol-\n See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64 (Brookings 2000).\n Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.\nCyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.” To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all. (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats. Even when states are able to deter\ntionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nDespite governments' tendency to keep facts about cyberwar attacks secret, not to mention their policies regarding cyberwar, publicly available information reveals several instances where states have engaged in true cyberwar. The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n1. Distinction.\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nfinds expression at lower levels of abstraction, such as in first-order rules banning specific means of warfare. Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected. However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,” would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nemploy the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants. Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.” Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining. For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.” Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2). See Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 90 (cited in note 11) (noting this is customary law), citing Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, *Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims* (2005), 45 ILM 396, 418 (2006).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 92–96 (cited in note 11)\n Id at 105.\n Michael Schmitt, *Targeting and Humanitarian Law: Current Issues*, 34 Israel Yearbook on Hum Rts 59, 60 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers. The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack. Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems. One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants. States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n Id at 60, 62.\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n See id.\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25). The United States does not recognize as customary law the “negative presumption that would bar attack” in cases of “object[s] normally dedicated to civilian purposes,” in the absence of evidence that it was actually used for military purposes. Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 98 (cited in note 11).\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 197–231 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\npower.” If state practice is consistent in this area, Clarke is correct to suggest that a state might try to target nationwide infrastructure (especially communications networks, top-tier internet service providers, and other systems), although given proportionality constraints his analysis still seems overly pessimistic. Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus. But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.\n## 3. Direct participation\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,” the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.” This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 96.\n Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIn normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button, but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces. Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.” In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\ntainly would have still taken place). Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.\nOptimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.” These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.” The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.\n Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here.

I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n### A. Standard Account\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nNatural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime.

They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects, prohibiting perfidy, prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants, or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons, to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests.

These intransgressible principles have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds. The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL. Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\" To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants. Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants.

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.” In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21). For “rules of the game,” see note 31 and accompanying text.\n See Rupert Ticehurst, The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict, 317 Intl Rev of the Red Cross 125 (1997).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 9 (cited in note 11). But see Eric Posner, *Terrorism and the Laws of War*, 5 Chi J Intl L 423, 427 (2005) (“[T]he ideal of humanitarianism does not explain why some weapons and tactics are outlawed and others are not.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nyears, so has that development process been sensitive to pragmatic concerns about waging effective war. IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use. States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that\n“the law of war allows ... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”\n See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105 (Jan-Feb 1973).\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24 (Cornell 1996).

Stephan, Don’t Go Downtown Without Us: The role of aerospace power in joint urban operations, 14 Aerospace Power J 3 (2000).\n Theodor Meron, The Humanization of Humanitarian Law, 94 Am J Intl L 239, 240 (2000).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nUnder the standard account, therefore, IHL rules are designed to serve not only humanitarian but also pragmatic interests. The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest. Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.\n## B. Rationalist Account\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness). Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nhave put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest. Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying. On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"\n See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004). Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”). See Solis, *Law of Armed Conflict* at 10 (cited in\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\n“states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality. The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game. Other times state practice does not re\nnote 8) (“We obey the law of war if for no other reason than because reciprocity tells us that what goes around comes around...”) (emphasis added). See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation. See Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works 33–38 (Oxford 2008).\n See Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 370–82 (cited in note 38).\n See id at 417–30.\n Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). See also Posner, manuscript at *6 (cited in note 38) (“Rules that make states jointly better off in one war but not in another war may be respected in the first war but will not be respected in the second. ... When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nsemble such games. Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.\nIts weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.” States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries. By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc\n See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (Harvard 1994) (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem. Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). This is known as the tit-for-tat strategy. Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added).

UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis. In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant. It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents.

They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* (Oxford 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nOther times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nStates facing an international conflict have a menu of options to choose from. For our purposes the two important options are bargaining and going to war. Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIt is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nimplement first-order threshold constraints. Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount\n See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74\nRules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Cornell 2003).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\naffect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.\nAs the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar. Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways. A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAs concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage. The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems. I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation. Consider the fol-\n See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64 (Brookings 2000).\n Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.\nCyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.” To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all. (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats. Even when states are able to deter\ntionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nDespite governments' tendency to keep facts about cyberwar attacks secret, not to mention their policies regarding cyberwar, publicly available information reveals several instances where states have engaged in true cyberwar. The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n1. Distinction.\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nfinds expression at lower levels of abstraction, such as in first-order rules banning specific means of warfare. Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected. However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,” would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nemploy the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants. Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.” Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining. For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.” Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2). See Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 90 (cited in note 11) (noting this is customary law), citing Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, *Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims* (2005), 45 ILM 396, 418 (2006).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 92–96 (cited in note 11)\n Id at 105.\n Michael Schmitt, *Targeting and Humanitarian Law: Current Issues*, 34 Israel Yearbook on Hum Rts 59, 60 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers. The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack. Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems. One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants. States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n Id at 60, 62.\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n See id.\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25). The United States does not recognize as customary law the “negative presumption that would bar attack” in cases of “object[s] normally dedicated to civilian purposes,” in the absence of evidence that it was actually used for military purposes. Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 98 (cited in note 11).\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 197–231 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\npower.” If state practice is consistent in this area, Clarke is correct to suggest that a state might try to target nationwide infrastructure (especially communications networks, top-tier internet service providers, and other systems), although given proportionality constraints his analysis still seems overly pessimistic. Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus. But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.\n## 3. Direct participation\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,” the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.” This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 96.\n Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIn normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button, but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces. Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.” In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\ntainly would have still taken place). Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.\nOptimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342",

Optimism biases and other strong preferences (like in-group preferences, which favor fellow countrymen over enemies) may lead battlefield decisionmakers to overestimate the expected value of the risky tail. Such biases may also lead them to maximize short-term military advantage while discounting the risk that such decisions would be detrimental to long-term interests or would violate a threshold constraint.70 By contrast, situation-room decisionmakers are unlikely to be as susceptible to the fog of war; with their macro-level perspective they are perhaps more likely to be risk averse. They are also more likely than their battlefield counterparts to show elasticity with regard to the cost of potential humanitarian casualties, or to prefer threshold constraints against such casualties. All else equal, states' preferences are likely to track the preferences of their situation-room decisionmakers rather than their battlefield decisionmakers, if only because the former group is institutionally closer to, and thus theoretically more in line with, the views of foreign policy elites and international lawyers who interpret treaties and execute the state practice of custom.",

Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal-\n† Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

Thanks to Aziz Huq. This is a working draft; readers’ comments are welcomed at tierney@uchicago.edu.\nTierney\n[2011\nling into two parallel approaches. On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.” These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.” The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.\n Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here. See generally Roger Alford and James Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law, in Donald\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIn the second half of the paper, I apply the constrained CBA approach to examine the emerging substantive problem of cyberwar. I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n### A. Standard Account\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nNatural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime. States have settled on a system of rules recognizing not only that war continues to exist as an institution of international society,10 but\ntures.\" Oona Hathaway and Ariel Lavinbuk, Rationalism and Revisionism in International Law, 119 Harv L Rev 1404, 1411 (2006).

They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects, prohibiting perfidy, prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants, or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons, to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests. The law of armed conflict thus serves to protect humanitarian interests when states have already decided to engage in war.\n Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 7–8 (cited in note 5), quoting *Declaration of St. Petersburg*, Nov 29–Dec 11, 1868, reprinted in *Conventions and Declarations Between the Powers Concerning War, Arbitration and Neutrality* 6 (1915). See also Frits Kalshoven and Liesbeth Zegveld, *Constraints on the Waging of War: An Introduction to International Humanitarian Law* 12 (ICRC 2001) (describing IHL as designed to “mitigate the human suffering caused by war”); Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflict* 5 (Cambridge 2d ed 2010) (calling this part of the St Petersburg Declaration “[t]he paramount precept” of the law of international armed conflict).\n Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 10 (cited in note 5), quoting Francis Lieber, *Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field* (“Lieber Code”), Art 16, at 8 (GPO 1898) (1863).

These intransgressible principles have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds. The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL. Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\" To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants. Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants. The principle of dis\n See Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1996 ICJ Rep 226, 257 (reducing the rules of IHL to the two \"intransgressible\" principles of distinction and avoiding unnecessary suffering).\n Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 299 (cited in note 2). But consider Sonia Cardenas, The Geneva Conventions and the Normative Tenor of International Relations, in Sarah Perrigo and Jim Whitman, eds, The Geneva Conventions Under Assault 1 (Pluto Press 2010); Sheldon Cohen, Arms and Judgment: Law, Morality, and the Conduct of War in the Twentieth Century (Westview Press 1989).\n United States v List et al (Hostage Case), 11 Nurem Mil Trials 1230, 1253 (American Tribunal, 1948).\n Additional Protocol I, Article 35(1).\n See Michael Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars 136–37 (Basic Books 3d ed 2000).\n Id at 136 (emphasis in original).\n Compare James Morrow, The Laws of War, Common Conjectures, and Legal Systems in International Politics, reprinted in Beth Simmons, ed, 5 International Law 249, 263 (Sage 2008) (\"[T]he laws of war operate as the codification of a common conjecture within an equilibrium...\"), with Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 39 (cited in note 5) (\"[T]he actions proscribed by IHL rules—torture, the conscription of enemy civilians to one's own armed forces, the direct targeting of civilians, [etc.]—are inherently repugnant, a violation of a moral impera\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAt higher levels of abstraction, by contrast, IHL rules are less explainable as reflecting simple deontological constraints. Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.” In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21). For “rules of the game,” see note 31 and accompanying text.\n See Rupert Ticehurst, The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict, 317 Intl Rev of the Red Cross 125 (1997).\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 9 (cited in note 11). But see Eric Posner, *Terrorism and the Laws of War*, 5 Chi J Intl L 423, 427 (2005) (“[T]he ideal of humanitarianism does not explain why some weapons and tactics are outlawed and others are not.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nyears, so has that development process been sensitive to pragmatic concerns about waging effective war. IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use. States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that\n“the law of war allows ... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”\n See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105 (Jan-Feb 1973).\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24 (Cornell 1996). See also N.A. Schwartz and R.B. Stephan, Don’t Go Downtown Without Us: The role of aerospace power in joint urban operations, 14 Aerospace Power J 3 (2000).\n Theodor Meron, The Humanization of Humanitarian Law, 94 Am J Intl L 239, 240 (2000).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nUnder the standard account, therefore, IHL rules are designed to serve not only humanitarian but also pragmatic interests. The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest. Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.\n## B. Rationalist Account\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness). Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nhave put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest. Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying. On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"\n See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004). Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”).

The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality. The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game.

See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation.

When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nsemble such games. Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.\nIts weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.” States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries. By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc\n See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (Harvard 1994) (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem.

Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added).

UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis. In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant. It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents. Thus, consequentialism arguably requires that we harvest the organs of one person to save the lives of two other people, that we torture the baby of a terrorist to force him to reveal information that may save lives, and so forth.”). They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* (Oxford 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nOther times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nStates facing an international conflict have a menu of options to choose from. For our purposes the two important options are bargaining and going to war. Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIt is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nimplement first-order threshold constraints. Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount\n See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74\nRules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Cornell 2003).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\naffect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.\nAs the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar. Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways. A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nAs concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage. The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems. I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation. Consider the fol-\n See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64 (Brookings 2000).\n Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.\nCyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.” To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all. (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats. Even when states are able to deter\ntionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nDespite governments' tendency to keep facts about cyberwar attacks secret, not to mention their policies regarding cyberwar, publicly available information reveals several instances where states have engaged in true cyberwar. The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n1. Distinction.\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nfinds expression at lower levels of abstraction, such as in first-order rules banning specific means of warfare. Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected. However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,” would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nemploy the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants. Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.” Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining. For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.” Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2). See Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 90 (cited in note 11) (noting this is customary law), citing Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, *Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims* (2005), 45 ILM 396, 418 (2006).\n Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 92–96 (cited in note 11)\n Id at 105.\n Michael Schmitt, *Targeting and Humanitarian Law: Current Issues*, 34 Israel Yearbook on Hum Rts 59, 60 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers. The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack. Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems. One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants. States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n Id at 60, 62.\n Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n See id.\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25). The United States does not recognize as customary law the “negative presumption that would bar attack” in cases of “object[s] normally dedicated to civilian purposes,” in the absence of evidence that it was actually used for military purposes. Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 98 (cited in note 11).\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 197–231 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\npower.” If state practice is consistent in this area, Clarke is correct to suggest that a state might try to target nationwide infrastructure (especially communications networks, top-tier internet service providers, and other systems), although given proportionality constraints his analysis still seems overly pessimistic. Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus. But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.\n## 3. Direct participation\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,” the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.” This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 96.\n Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nIn normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button, but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces. Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.” In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\ntainly would have still taken place). Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.\nOptimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342"

Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal-\n† Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.”¹ These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.”² The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.³\n¹ Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n² Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n³ I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here. See generally Roger Alford and James Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law, in Donald\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n3\nEven bracketing this psychological approach, which is kindred with recent advances in behavioral law and economics, scholars have also developed an economic framework for analyzing non-instrumental constraints on instrumental logic. In a recent book, Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina bridge the gap between consequentialist and deontological moral theories—which tracks a similar gap between instrumental and non-instrumental logic—by imposing threshold conditions on social welfare functions.⁴ As I explain in greater detail in Part II, by using Zamir and Medina’s deontologically constrained cost-benefit analysis (“constrained CBA”) approach, scholars are better able to explain and understand complex bodies of law that are the product of instrumental and non-instrumental concerns alike.⁵\nIn the second half of the paper, I apply the constrained CBA approach to examine the emerging substantive problem of cyberwar. I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR\n### A. Standard Account\nOver centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.⁶\nChildress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n⁴ See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality* (Oxford 2010).\n⁵ Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n⁶ This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nNatural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime.

Although a discussion of jus ad bellum and the recourse to war is outside the scope of this paper, my point here is to note that states and publicists have concluded that war cannot and perhaps should not be outlawed, for sometimes it serves good ends—not just pragmatic state\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n5\nalso that in light of war's continuing existence noncombatants should be spared the risk of harm from war wherever possible. Enlightened states in an enlightened era recognized the importance of limiting war's primary effects to military targets. Early multilateral statements to this effect emphasized that “the progress of civilization should have the effect of alleviating as much as possible the calamities of war,” accomplished by states placing noncombatants off-limits and seeking only to “weaken the military forces of the enemy.”¹¹ The Lieber Code made clear that “military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge.”¹²\nHaving crystallized over the years, these ideas find expression today at all levels of generality in the law of armed conflict. They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects,¹³ prohibiting perfidy,¹⁴ prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants,¹⁵ or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons,¹⁶ to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests.

These intransgressible principles¹⁷ have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this \"feel\" because, as Eric Posner correctly notes, \"it is hard to find a detailed defense\" of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds.¹⁸ The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about \"the complete submission of the enemy\" while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL.¹⁹ Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that \"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\"²⁰ To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants.²¹ Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose), \"no one else is made to be killed.\"²²\nGiven such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants.²³ The principle of dis\n¹⁷ See Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1996 ICJ Rep 226, 257 (reducing the rules of IHL to the two \"intransgressible\" principles of distinction and avoiding unnecessary suffering).\n¹⁸ Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 299 (cited in note 2).

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV²⁷), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.”²⁸ In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over\ntive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n²⁴ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n²⁵ The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n²⁶ Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21).

IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use.²⁹ States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.³⁰\nThese consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that\n“the law of war allows ... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”³¹\n²⁹ See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105 (Jan-Feb 1973).\n³⁰ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24 (Cornell 1996).

According to the Nuremberg Tribunal’s judgment in the Hostage case, with regard to such rules “[m]ilitary necessity or expediency do not justify a violation.”³² Yet IHL plainly recognizes other circumstances in which military necessity is properly balanced against other interests. Consider how military necessity permits combatants to kill innocent noncombatants if proportionality threshold constraints are met.³³\nUnder the standard account, therefore, IHL rules are designed to serve not only humanitarian but also pragmatic interests. The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest.³⁴ Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.³⁵\n## B. Rationalist Account\nThe standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness).³⁶ Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars\n³² Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n³³ See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n³⁴ Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n³⁵ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n³⁶ See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nhave put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest.³⁷ Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying.³⁸ On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely: \"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"³⁹\n³⁷ See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204 (Oxford 2004). Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n³⁸ See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n³⁹ Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”). See Solis, *Law of Armed Conflict* at 10 (cited in\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n11\nThe reciprocity thesis has a strong pedigree in the history of international law. States' obligations under bilateral and multilateral treaties, and under certain rules of customary international law, turn in part on whether other parties (or states recognizing the custom) are holding up their end of the bargain.⁴⁰ Reciprocity norms also existed in strong form during the early periods of humanitarian law reform, although it is an open question whether state practice recognizes those norms as viable today.⁴¹ Either way, scholars continue to defend the reciprocity thesis today. As Eric Posner explains,\n“states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”⁴²\nThe reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality.⁴³ The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game. Other times state practice does not re\nnote 8) (“We obey the law of war if for no other reason than because reciprocity tells us that what goes around comes around...”) (emphasis added). See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation. See Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works 33–38 (Oxford 2008).\n⁴⁰ See Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 370–82 (cited in note 38).\n⁴¹ See id at 417–30.\n⁴² Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). See also Posner, manuscript at *6 (cited in note 38) (“Rules that make states jointly better off in one war but not in another war may be respected in the first war but will not be respected in the second. ... When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n⁴³ Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nsemble such games.⁴⁴ Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.⁴⁵\nIts weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be⁴⁶), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.”⁴⁷ States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries.⁴⁸ By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc\n⁴⁴ See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (Harvard 1994) (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n⁴⁵ See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n⁴⁶ Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem. Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). This is known as the tit-for-tat strategy. Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added). In light of that scholarly tradition, Posner’s adherence to the tit-for-tat posture is puzzling.\n⁴⁷ Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 368 (cited in note 38); id at 431 (“[S]tate practice vindicates the claim that states’ insistence on reciprocity has subsided over time.”).\n⁴⁸ See James Morrow, When Do States Follow the Laws of War? 101 Am Pol Sci Rev 559, 570 (2007) (“States then are more likely to comply with the laws of war when they have internalized those laws in their military training and [military] justice. These mechanisms increase compliance by strengthening reciprocity by reducing noise.”); David Kennedy, Of War and Law 32 (Princeton 2006) (“Military professionals also have desires for law. For starters, they also turn to law to limit the violence of warfare, to ensure some safety, some decency, among professionals on different sides of the conflict.”); Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 10 (cited in note 8) (noting the reciprocity thesis, but noting that “[w]e obey the law of war because it is the law and because it is the honourable path for a nation that holds itself up as a protector of oppressed peoples”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n13\nity thesis means its explanatory force is weaker than what a more complete account might provide.\n## II. UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis.⁴⁹ In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant.⁵⁰ It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n⁴⁹ See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n⁵⁰ See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents. Thus, consequentialism arguably requires that we harvest the organs of one person to save the lives of two other people, that we torture the baby of a terrorist to force him to reveal information that may save lives, and so forth.”). They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* (Oxford 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n51 Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 43 (cited in note 5) (suggesting that different commentators or analysts will set this threshold breaking-point at different points along the spectrum of consequences). While scholars such as Blum have begun to employ threshold deontology in the analysis of IHL rules, this paper appears to be the first to address these rules using constrained CBA.\n52 Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* at 74 (cited in note 4).\n53 See Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 68 (cited in note 5) (“[T]he current system of [international humanitarian law] is neither purely deontological—for it makes numerous concessions in allowing wars to be fought in the first place—nor purely consequentialist—for it prohibits certain actions even when those might produce less suffering in totality.”).\n54 Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 161 (cited in note 11) (“[IHL] imposes a general obligation to accept the surrender of enemy combatants who clearly express an intention do so.”). See Additional Protocol I, Art 40 (forbidding state practice or threats of a no-quarter policy); Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Art 8(2)(b)(xii) (making it a crime to “declar[e] that no quarter will be given”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n15\nlute.” This term covers not only jus cogens norms, but also norms for which opinio juris or state practice generally strikes the balance in favor of humanitarian consideration (but for which persistent objectors or other factors mean they are not “absolute”).55\nOther times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58\nEach of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n55 On the imperfect nature of some customary rules, see Theodor Meron, The Geneva Conventions as Customary Law, 81–2 Am J Intl L 348 (1987).\n56 UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 68 (UK Ministry of Defence 2004).

Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61\nWhen rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62\nCost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n59 See, for example, James Fearon, Rationalist Explanations for War, 49 Intl Org 379 (1995).\n60 For simplicity I assume that in an international armed conflict a state's citizens will prefer the bundle of goods that the state provides to the bundle that the enemy state would provide. I also bracket the question of non-international armed conflicts, see Additional Protocol II, and international armed conflicts involving fights \"against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist régimes,\" Additional Protocol I, Art 1.4. These two latter types of conflicts will usually involve an internal market for public goods where some non-negligible segment of the population prefers insurgents' bundle of goods to the status quo regime's bundle of goods.\n61 See Gideon Parchomovsky and Peter Siegelman, Bribes vs. bombs: A Study in Coasean Warfare, 29 Intl Rev of L &amp; Econ 179, 180 (2009), quoting Robert Powell, War as a Commitment Problem, 60 Intl Org 169, 169 (2006) (\"[T]he pie to be divided after the fighting begins is smaller than it was before the war started. This means that there are usually divisions of the larger pie that would have given each belligerent more than it will have after the fighting. Fighting, therefore, leads to a Pareto inferior or inefficient outcome.\"). This is not to mention that war may be undesirable for reasons other than Pareto inferiority, including deontological constraints against \"us[ing] force to resist, punish, or prevent [further] violence.\" Jan Narveson, Pacifism: A Philosophical Analysis, 75 Ethics 259, 259 (1965).\n62 See Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 141 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n17\nquences (as when the state substitutes away from welfare expenditures in favor of war expenditures).63 Cost reduction strategies may also manifest on the back end, such as by selecting policies, tactics, and rules of engagement that recoup fixed costs of procurement and maintenance by increasing the marginal military advantage gained when a soldier fires his gun, a pilot drops a bomb, or a unit captures a POW.\nIt is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64\nThe constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that\n63 This is the tradeoff between purchasing guns or butter. On the other hand, Kevin Narizny has challenged this traditional idea, noting that for ideological reasons domestic political coalitions may see guns and butter not as substitutes but rather as complementary goods. See Kevin Narizny, *Both Guns and Butter*, or *Neither: Class Interests in the Political Economy of Rearmament*, 97 Am Pol Sci Rev 203 (2003).\n64 See Walzer, *Just and Unjust Wars* at 262 (cited in note 21) (“[S]uch calculations need not be concerned only with the preservation of life. There is much else that we might plausibly want to preserve: the quality of our lives, for example, our civilization and morality, our collective abhorrence of murder, even when it seems, as it always does, to serve some purpose.”).\n65 Some rationalists might object here that a preference for deontological constraints is really just an interest, making the analysis no different from that offered by standard consequentialism. This objection is largely unconvincing because it collapses first-order preferences for satisfying self-interest with second-order preferences for rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest by introducing absolute or threshold constraints against certain outcomes. Moreover, the objection is methodologically suspect, for it assumes away the existence of endogenous non-instrumental reasons for preferring rules that constrain pursuit of self-interest.\n66 See note 8 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nimplement first-order threshold constraints.⁶⁷ Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.⁶⁸\nStates will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.⁶⁹\nThird, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount\n⁶⁷ See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n⁶⁸ See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n⁶⁹ Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n19\nof uncertainty in the risky tail. Optimism biases and other strong preferences (like in-group preferences, which favor fellow countrymen over enemies) may lead battlefield decisionmakers to overestimate the expected value of the risky tail. Such biases may also lead them to maximize short-term military advantage while discounting the risk that such decisions would be detrimental to long-term interests or would violate a threshold constraint.70 By contrast, situation-room decisionmakers are unlikely to be as susceptible to the fog of war; with their macro-level perspective they are perhaps more likely to be risk averse. They are also more likely than their battlefield counterparts to show elasticity with regard to the cost of potential humanitarian casualties, or to prefer threshold constraints against such casualties. All else equal, states' preferences are likely to track the preferences of their situation-room decisionmakers rather than their battlefield decisionmakers, if only because the former group is institutionally closer to, and thus theoretically more in line with, the views of foreign policy elites and international lawyers who interpret treaties and execute the state practice of custom.\nAmong equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener\n70 Consider in this sense rules limiting perfidy, or the debate about “double-tapping” combatants who appear to be dead. See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 327–30 (cited in note 8). Such tactics might maximize short-term battlefield interests, albeit at the expense of longer-term interests (threat of reciprocal perfidy in future armed conflict) or the violation of threshold constraints (killing enemy combatants rather than checking whether they are alive but rendered hors de combat and thus entitled to be detained).\n71 See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 302 (cited in note 2) (“[T]he discrimination principle … requires a military force to take losses rather than inflict too much harm on civilians and civilian property … thus increasing the cost of achieving a given objective”). The same can be said about rules against no-quarter declarations, since detaining prisoners is more costly than killing them outright. See id, citing Morrow, 55 Intl Org at 979 (cited in note 46). If double-tapping practices are forms of no-quarter practices, see note 70, then attempts to constrain double-tapping similarly increase short-term battlefield costs but decrease not only longer-term reciprocal costs but also the likelihood that threshold constraints against killing combatants rendered hors de combat.\n72 Combined with cost-reduction preferences, see text between notes 61 and 63, these effects may lead states to purchase offensive and defensive capabilities from private military contractors (PMCs), which may be (but are not necessarily) Pareto superior to organized armed\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74\nRules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE\nThe constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Cornell 2003).\n73 Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 301 (cited in note 2).\n74 Id. For more on the wasteful nature of expenditures, see note 61 and accompanying text.\n75 Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 305 (cited in note 2) (describing rules limiting destructive effects, such as limits on “weapons that cause devastating wounds, on mines and other weapons whose dangerousness persists after the conflict ends, and on weapons that cause significant environmental harm”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n21\n# A. Technology in the Laws of War\nParties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to \"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they\n76 See Robert Jervis, Cooperation under the Security Dilemma, 30 World Politics 167, 169 (1978) (describing this spiral model). See also Charles Glaser, The Security Dilemma Revisited, 50 World Pol 171 (1997); Brian Frederking, Resolving Security Dilemmas: A constructivist explanation of the INF treaty (Ashgate 2000).\n77 Thomas Wingfield, The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace 3 (Aegis 2000).

See also Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 67–88 (cited in note 11) (describing attempts to ban, limit, and regulate the use of specific weapons through history); Henckaerts and Doswald-Beck, Volume 1 at 237–98 (cited in note 13) (describing customary international law restrictions on specific weapons).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\naffect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.⁷⁸\nAs the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar.⁷⁹ Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways.⁸⁰ A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar\nDevelopments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be\n⁷⁸ See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n⁷⁹ See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War* (Ecco 2010). I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n⁸⁰ See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n23\ninsecure, opening them to the risk of exploitation or damage by a network owner's adversaries, criminals, or other malefactors.⁸¹\nAs concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”⁸² While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage.⁸³ The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.⁸⁴\nThese means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems.⁸⁵ I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation.⁸⁶ Consider the fol-\n⁸¹ See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64 (Brookings 2000).\n⁸² Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n⁸³ See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179 (MIT 2010).\n⁸⁴ See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n⁸⁵ See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n⁸⁶ Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁸⁷ Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.⁸⁸\nCyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.”⁸⁹ To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all.⁹⁰ (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats.⁹¹ Even when states are able to deter\ntionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n87 See Schaap, 64 Air Force L Rev at 134–35 (cited in note 79).\n88 Id at 135–37.\n89 Compare note 90. I do not mean to suggest that cybercrime and cyberespionage are not serious. Indeed, cyberespionage can set the stage for later network attacks, serving as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where they key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.” Christopher Joyner and Catherine Lotrione, Information Warfare as International Coercion: Elements of a Legal Framework, 12 Eur J Intl L 825, 841 n 60 (2001).

Michael Schmitt has offered a six-part test to determine whether a cyber attack has occurred for jus ad bellum purposes; further discussion of these criteria is outside the scope of this paper. See Michael N. Schmitt, Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework, 37 Colum J Transnational L 887, 914–16 (1999) (enumerating these criteria as severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, and presumptive legitimacy). Compare Wingfield, Information Conflict at 365 (cited in note 77) (offering the simpler conclusion that “[a]most any computer network attack that intentionally causes almost any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is probably … an armed attack”). For more on the difficulty of determining whether an attack has occurred, and who the attacker might be, see David A. Wheeler and Gregory N. Larsen, Techniques for Cyber Attack Attribution (Institute for Defense Analyses Paper P-3792) (October 2003), available online at http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA468859.\n91 The recent vintage of cyberwarfare technology makes it a prototypical “current” threat. For example, the United States’ strategy document on cyberwarfare remains classified. Clarke, Cyber War at 95 (cited in note 79) (describing PDD-54).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n25\nmine that a cyberwar attack has occurred, if they decline to respond with kinetic weapons, observers outside the government and military might never learn that an attack has occurred.\nDespite governments' tendency to keep facts about cyberwar attacks secret, not to mention their policies regarding cyberwar, publicly available information reveals several instances where states have engaged in true cyberwar. The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately \"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\" a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including \"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that \"volunteers ... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n1. Distinction.\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that \"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also\n92 Id at 17–21. See Schaap, 64 Air Force L Rev at 143–47 (cited in note 79).\n93 Clarke, Cyber War at 20 (cited in note 79).\n94 Id.\n95 Additional Protocol I, Art 57(3).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nfinds expression at lower levels of abstraction, such as in first-order rules banning specific means of warfare. Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98\nCyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by \"smart\" bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to\n96 Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 68 (cited in note 11).

A strong case could be made that the state would have violated the customary prohibition against weapons that cannot discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. If it designed cyber weapons with the goal of targeting civilian systems, the case for state responsibility would be even clearer.\nThe other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected.¹⁰² However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,”¹⁰³ would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not\nputers. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n¹⁰² Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n¹⁰³ Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nemploy the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants.¹⁰⁴ Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”¹⁰⁵ Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining.¹⁰⁶ For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”¹⁰⁷\nRules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.”¹⁰⁸ Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed\n¹⁰⁴ Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n¹⁰⁵ Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2). See Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 90 (cited in note 11) (noting this is customary law), citing Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission, *Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims* (2005), 45 ILM 396, 418 (2006).\n¹⁰⁶ Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 92–96 (cited in note 11)\n¹⁰⁷ Id at 105.\n¹⁰⁸ Michael Schmitt, *Targeting and Humanitarian Law: Current Issues*, 34 Israel Yearbook on Hum Rts 59, 60 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n29\nand/or displaced second- and third-order consequences of military action ... [like] loss of support for a regime.\"¹⁰⁹ States that substitute toward these latter kinds of effect-based operations thus face tough legal dilemmas about whether the collateral consequences of targeting decisions are proportionate to the military advantage gained. Moreover, they must be careful to tailor the goals of their effects-based operations, since customary IHL rules disapprove states' attempts to use targeting decisions to “‘forc[e] a change in the negotiating attitudes’ of the enemy” or achieve other “political outcome[s].”¹¹⁰\nCyberwar poses risks to civilian objects as collateral consequences of the interconnectedness of military and civilian networks and systems. In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers.¹¹¹ The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack.¹¹² Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems.¹¹³ One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants.¹¹⁴ States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without\n¹⁰⁹ Id at 60, 62.\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹¹ Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n¹¹² See id.\n¹¹³ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25). The United States does not recognize as customary law the “negative presumption that would bar attack” in cases of “object[s] normally dedicated to civilian purposes,” in the absence of evidence that it was actually used for military purposes. Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 98 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹⁴ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 197–231 (cited in note 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\npower.”¹¹⁵ If state practice is consistent in this area, Clarke is correct to suggest that a state might try to target nationwide infrastructure (especially communications networks, top-tier internet service providers, and other systems), although given proportionality constraints his analysis still seems overly pessimistic. Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁶ But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁷\n## 3. Direct participation\nThe final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack ... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”¹¹⁸ As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,”¹¹⁹ the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.”¹²⁰ This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be\n¹¹⁵ Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n¹¹⁶ By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n¹¹⁷ This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n¹¹⁸ Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n¹¹⁹ Id at 96.\n¹²⁰ Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n31\ntween the activity engaged in and the harm done to the enemy at the time and the place where the activity takes place.”¹²¹\nIn normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button,¹²² but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet¹²³ without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces.¹²⁴ Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.”¹²⁵ In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer-\n¹²¹ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679 (ICRC 1987).\n¹²² See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n¹²³ See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n¹²⁴ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n¹²⁵ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\ntainly would have still taken place).¹²⁶ Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.¹²⁷\nOptimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat¹²⁸ apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION\nThreshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some\n¹²⁶ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n¹²⁷ Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n¹²⁸ See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\n2011]\nThreshold Constraints and Laws of War\n33\nanticipated military action. In some contexts balancing and proportionality matter, yet in other contexts “the ends justify the means” arguments fall upon deaf ears. States (and jurists) will continue to propose and to make institutional design choices for the foreseeable future. They are likely to take such constraints into account even when they serve legitimate consequentialist concerns about the necessity of neutralizing active military threats.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342"

Yet only in recent modernity have states focused on a set of *jus in bello* rules, allowing them to crystallize into a complex framework of inter-dependent textual and customary law. As currently understood, the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), have two main problems.\nOne problem is theoretical. IHL rules forge a balance between deontological humanitarian concerns on one hand, and consequentialist military-advantage concerns on the other hand. Yet the literature provides inadequate theoretical foundations for the balances these rules make at a structural level. IHL theories can be described as fal- † Law clerk designate to Judge Mary M.

This is a working draft; readers’ comments are welcomed at tierney@uchicago.edu.\nTierney [2011 ling into two parallel approaches. On one hand, the standard account holds that humanitarian law “impose[s] some limits, however ineffective, to a complete reversion to anarchy by the establishment of minimum standards on the conduct of war.”¹ These scholars’ methodology, however, is ad hoc and unsatisfying. On the other hand, the rationalist or economic account posits that such laws—and state practice—are merely epiphenomenal of states’ interests; on this account the rules are “behavioral regularities rather than constraints on self-interested behavior.”² The economic account provides methodological rigor but discounts the deontological constraints that inhere in formal doctrine and state practice.\nThe second problem is substantive. As I show below, IHL rules balance a variety of concerns, including moral constraints against killing noncombatants, attempts to minimize battlefield uncertainty, and states’ preferences for rules and tactics that reduce the costs of executing wars. In an age where technological advancements are rapidly changing the menu of tactical options from which states may choose in carrying out armed conflict, IHL rules will need to be reconsidered to determine whether they fit the emerging and operational opportunities and threats posed by cyberwarfare.\nIn this paper, I address each of these problems.\nRegarding the first problem, I explain the standard and rationalist (economic) accounts of IHL rules, then explain how these accounts cannot alone account for the diversity of rules and principles observed in the formal doctrine and in state practice. I then seek a synthesis of the two strands of IHL scholarship, arguing that states’ revealed preference for norms fleshing out those “minimum standards” can not be brushed aside as mere “behavioral regularities.” To be sure, many of these minimum standards are the result of purely instrumental coordination, since all belligerents are better off with full compliance under conditions of transparency and effective enforcement. But recognizing that states sometimes act for non-instrumental reasons supplements rather than falsifies claims that states act rationally under other circumstances. By relying on psychological theories of moral cognition, which explain how people justify their decisions about whether to follow one or another mutually inconsistent behavioral prescriptions, it is possible to talk about instrumental and non-instrumental rationales in the same breath.³ ¹ Georg Schwarzenberger, 2 International Law: As Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 10 (Stevens &amp; Sons 1968).\n² Eric Posner, A Theory of the Laws of War, 70 U Chi L Rev 297, 309 (2003).\n³ I have defended this position in other work and will allude to it only briefly here. See generally Roger Alford and James Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law, in Donald Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War In the second half of the paper, I apply the constrained CBA approach to examine the emerging substantive problem of cyberwar. I shift focus from the theoretical to the substantive by showing how the concerns identified in the first part of the paper can and should influence institutional design considerations, especially under conditions of uncertainty about future battlefield situations. I aim to explore how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\n## I. MODELING THE LAWS OF WAR ### A. Standard Account Over centuries, social practices and wars have had constitutive effects on each other. The emergence of the modern nation-state—relatively recent in human history—was to some extent itself a measure to reduce the violence endemic to pre-social anarchy. States found untrammeled violence endemic in the anarchy of the battlefield, too, and micro-scale civilizing processes occurred there through the constitutive interplay of state practice and emerging norms of warfare.⁶ Childress and Roger Alford, eds, *The Role of Ethics in International Law* (Cambridge, forthcoming 2011).\n⁴ See generally Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina, *Law, Economics, and Morality*.\n⁵ Some scholars have already made steps toward bridging the gap between deontological and consequentialist accounts of IHL. For example, Gabriella Blum has recognized that the humanitarian purposes served by rules presently recognized as absolute may sometimes be better served by recognizing a “humanitarian necessity” exception that would permit derogation under limited circumstances. See Gabriella Blum, *The Laws of War and the “Lesser Evil,”* 35 Yale J Intl L 1 (2010).\n⁶ This is a constructivist explanation for how the laws of war developed. “Constructivism asks how norms evolve and how identities are constituted, analyzing … the role of identity in shaping political action and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and struc Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 Natural lawyers, theologians, and just war theorists were among the first actors to shape these norms in late antiquity and early modernity.7 More recently, norm entrepreneurs ranging from international lawyers and statesmen negotiating at peace conferences, to pacifist activists and the International Committee for the Red Cross, have been crucial in shepherding that constitutive process.8 The history and development of humanitarian law are of course far more complicated than suggested here,9 but this brief sketch suffices for present purposes.\nThese civilizing processes reflect the emergence of shared ideas about what kinds of risks or harms states would tolerate during wartime. States have settled on a system of rules recognizing not only that war continues to exist as an institution of international society,10 but tures.\"Oona Hathaway and Ariel Lavinbuk, Rationalism and Revisionism in International Law, 119 Harv L Rev 1404, 1411 (2006).

They appear in the core humanitarian law principles of distinction, military necessity, and proportionality, insofar as those rules seek to protect noncombatants against accidental or unnecessary exposure to the harms inherent to war. They also find expression in specific rules prohibiting intentional targeting of civilians and civilian objects,¹³ prohibiting perfidy,¹⁴ prohibiting torture or summary execution of detained combatants,¹⁵ or prohibiting certain kinds of weapons,¹⁶ to name only a few.\ninterests but also humanitarian interests. The law of armed conflict thus serves to protect humanitarian interests when states have already decided to engage in war.\n¹¹ Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 7–8 (cited in note 5), quoting *Declaration of St. Petersburg*, Nov 29–Dec 11, 1868, reprinted in *Conventions and Declarations Between the Powers Concerning War, Arbitration and Neutrality* 6 (1915).

These intransgressible principles¹⁷ have the feel of deontological constraints against war's means. I say they have this\"feel\"because, as Eric Posner correctly notes,\"it is hard to find a detailed defense\"of these intransgressible principles on deontological grounds.¹⁸ The details of the defense appear piecemeal from a formalist reading of the doctrine and commentary, as well as from a functionalist reading of what states seek to accomplish in setting limits on the means of war. The position that military necessity permits means of effectively bringing about\"the complete submission of the enemy\"while minimizing the costs of war is not absolute; the set of possible means is limited by the requirement that such means be consistent with IHL.¹⁹ Indeed, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions exhorts that\"the right of the Parties to [an international armed] conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.\"²⁰ To that end, the few theorists who have addressed deontological ethics during wartime (like Michael Walzer) have emphasized the rights-centric nature of IHL rules, especially with regard to noncombatants.²¹ Even accepting that sometimes states will resort to war and that sometimes combatants will be killed (for this is their purpose),\"no one else is made to be killed.\"²² Given such constraints, it does not make much sense to describe or try to understand these rules solely in the language of consequentialism. They are not merely the solutions to cooperation games between adversarial states in which each state determines that on balance (and under conditions of transparency and full compliance) all are made better off by sparing noncombatants.²³ The principle of dis ¹⁷ See Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 1996 ICJ Rep 226, 257 (reducing the rules of IHL to the two\"intransgressible\"principles of distinction and avoiding unnecessary suffering).\n¹⁸ Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 299 (cited in note 2).

Yoram Dinstein has suggested that while “‘principles of humanity’ and ‘the dictates of public conscience’ may foster the evolution of” the law of armed conflict (as in their inclusion in the Martens Clause in the Preamble to Hague Convention IV²⁷), “they do not constitute additional standards for judging the legality of means or methods of warfare.”²⁸ In addition to the moral concerns that motivated policymakers, military officers, and norm entrepreneurs to shape and reform IHL over tive in the Kantian sense, independent of any cost-benefit calculation in any particular instance.”) (emphasis added).\n²⁴ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 8 (cited in note 11), quoting Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, 1996 ICJ Rep at 257 (cited in note 17).\n²⁵ The standard (consequentialist) account of IHL rules can explain the difference between combatants and noncombatants in the normal case—that is, where the noncombatant is not directly participating in hostilities. The former may be legitimately targeted because in theory they remain a threat even when off duty, while the latter may not be targeted directly because in theory they are not a threat. Of course, noncombatants may be targeted when they directly participate in hostilities, even if (in a strict sense) they remain a threat to the adversary after they may no longer be targeted. See Additional Protocol II, Art 13(3); Ian Henderson, The Contemporary Law of Targeting: Military Objectives, Proportionality, and Precautions in Attack under Additional Protocol I 95–98 (Martinus Nijhoff 2008) (describing rules providing that “[a] civilian loses [her] protection from attack only for such time as [she] take[s] a direct part in hostilities”). The constrained CBA account described in Part II.A recognizes that good reasons to question whether soldiers may legitimately be killed when they pose no threat. Under such circumstances the military advantage to be had by killing the combatant does not satisfy the threshold constraint against killing persons (even if they are soldiers). Gabriella Blum has articulated this argument well. See Gabriella Blum, The Dispensable Lives of Soldiers, 2 J Leg Analysis 115 (2010).\n²⁶ Except to the extent that they are specifically encoded in lex scripta or customary law, deontological constraints on conduct in international armed conflict are the stuff of philosophy and ethics, not law. See Blum, Laws of War, 35 Yale J Intl L at 38–53 (cited in note 5) (noting the disconnect between philosophers and lawyers on the role that such constraints play in IHL). For a good discussion of the ethics of jus ad bellum as well as jus in bello, see generally Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars (cited in note 21). For “rules of the game,” see note 31 and accompanying text.\n²⁷ See Rupert Ticehurst, The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict, 317 Intl Rev of the Red Cross 125 (1997).\n²⁸ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 9 (cited in note 11). But see Eric Posner, *Terrorism and the Laws of War*, 5 Chi J Intl L 423, 427 (2005) (“[T]he ideal of humanitarianism does not explain why some weapons and tactics are outlawed and others are not.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 years, so has that development process been sensitive to pragmatic concerns about waging effective war. IHL rules are designed not only to protect noncombatants and protected persons, but also detainees placed hors de combat and to a limited extent active combatants.\nDespite the seeming inconsistency between protections for combatants on one hand, and on the other hand the prosecution of an armed conflict that puts those combatants at risk of capture, injury, or death, IHL rules can also be justified on pragmatic grounds. States might agree ex ante that certain unduly harsh battlefield practices—such as no-quarter rules, or norms permitting the use of weapons that inflict unnecessary suffering—are particularly undesirable because they destroy morale among one's own troops notwithstanding the expected military advantage to be gained from their use.²⁹ States might also agree that targeting civilian populations through indiscriminate urban carpet-bombing campaigns, perhaps in an attempt to undercut civilian resolve and popular support for the war, is undesirable because it emboldens and entrenches the enemy.³⁰ These consequentialist rationales for IHL rules would differ in kind from the deontological (humanitarian) rationales for the same rules, but both kinds of rationales would cut in the same way. In other cases the rationales cut in different directions, sometimes in dispositive ways: IHL has rules in which consequentialist logic governs, and rules in which deontological logic governs. Consider one scholar's observation that “the law of war allows... the killing and wounding of innocent human beings not directly participating in an armed conflict, such as civilian victims of lawful collateral damage. As long as rules of the game are observed, it is permissible [in armed conflict] to cause suffering, deprivation of freedom, and death.”³¹ ²⁹ See, for example, Solis, Law of Armed Conflict at 9 (cited in note 8), citing Jordan J. Paust, letter, 25 Naval War College Rev 105.\n³⁰ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 125–26 (cited in note 11) (criticizing the “morale-shattering” strategies adopted during World War II). See also Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 251–69 (cited in note 21). Robert Pape has shown that the strategic logic underlying military attacks against civilian populations is deeply flawed, for the effects are often opposite what the attacker intended: “The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain—civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government—does not stand up.” Robert Pape, Bombing to Win 24. See also N.A.

The perspective from which commentators and practitioners approach the problem of armed conflict is likely to manifest as a thumb on the scale in favor of one or the other interest.³⁴ Such differences in perspective are also likely to cause disagreements about the content of specific contentious rules. In light of such disagreements, it is remarkable that commentators and practitioners generally agree that international humanitarian law encompasses both humanitarian and pragmatic interests.³⁵ ## B. Rationalist Account The standard account can be contrasted with what is best described as the economic or rationalist account of IHL. Despite the substantial attention rationalist scholars have paid to diverse areas of international law, they have paid surprisingly little attention to the rules governing armed conflict. This is surprising because at least certain rules plainly embody what international relations scholars call the logic of consequences (as compared to the logic of appropriateness).³⁶ Here, I briefly recount the primary arguments rationalist scholars ³² Hostage Case, 11 Nurem Mil Trials at 1256.\n³³ See, for example, Additional Protocol I, Art 51(5)(b); Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 6 (cited in note 11).\n³⁴ Military analysts are likely to focus on the pragmatic interests that IHL protects, while scholars and activists are perhaps more likely to focus on the humanitarian interests.\n³⁵ See Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 5 (cited in note 11) (“While the outlines of the compromise vary from one LOIAC [law of international armed conflict] norm to another, it can be categorically stated that no part of LOIAC overlooks military requirements, just as no part of LOIAC loses sight of humanitarian considerations.”); Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars at 135 (cited in note 21) (focusing on the rights of noncombatants, arguing that “when soldiers respect these [rules], they are not acting kindly or gently or magnanimously; they are acting justly,” but recognizing that consequences matter, as in proportionality calculations).\n³⁶ See, for example, Harald Müller, Arguing, Bargaining and all that: Communicative Action, Rationalist Theory and the Logic of Appropriateness in International Relations, 10 Eur J Intl Rel 395 (2004).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 have put forward in explaining and accounting for IHL rules, then show why such arguments are seriously flawed.\nThe rationalist turn in international law scholarship assumes states are egoistic unitary actors that maximize their self-interest.³⁷ Put simply, states are likely to violate international law where the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits. It is an open and closely contested question whether (or to what extent) rationalist accounts are better able to explain doctrine and state practice than other international-law perspectives (such as legal process, liberal, or constructivist theories). In this paper I accept the methodological framework of rationalist approaches in attempting a synthesis between economic and standard accounts of IHL. But accepting that states sometimes act consistent with rationalist predictions (following the logic of consequences) is not to deny that states sometimes act inconsistent with those predictions (following the logic of appropriateness). Even if rationalist explanations are sometimes underinclusive, other times the explanations are robust and show good fit with state practice.\nRationality assumptions undercut whatever force moral concerns may have, for rules are designed as instrumental means of serving states' strategic, material, and other interests. In other words, scholars within the rationalist tradition define the goals in terms of the interests that given rules serve, and costs and benefits that accrue from compliance with those rules. They emphasize the role that reciprocity plays in ensuring compliance, since rational states will not bear the costs of complying with the laws of war if they do not gain the benefits because the enemy is not complying.³⁸ On this account, IHL rules developed first because states were rationally interested in ensuring that their noncombatant citizens were not targeted and that their combatant soldiers were not treated inhumanely:\"The concern for others was merely the reciprocal price to pay.\"³⁹ ³⁷ See Jack Goldsmith and Eric Posner, *The Limits of International Law* 185–204. Here, I use the term “rationalist” interchangeably with the term “economic,” although as Part II.A shows, it is possible to engage in economic analysis without being a pure consequentialist.\n³⁸ See, for example, Sean Watts, *Reciprocity and the Law of War*, 50 Harv Intl L J 365, 366 (2009) (“Few would consider practicable a legal regime that required one side to ‘fight with one hand tied behind its back’ while its enemy exercised free reign.”); Eric Posner, *Human Rights, the Laws of War, and Reciprocity* *4 (manuscript, Sept 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1693974 (“If the other state uses harsh tactics, then the first state is put at a disadvantage if it does not use them. Yet both states are better off if they both refrain from using harsh tactics than if they both use harsh tactics.”); Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–30 (cited in note 28); Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 311 (cited in note 2).\n³⁹ Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 52 (cited in note 5) (“The laws of war were originally developed not out of any humanitarian concern for ‘the other,’ but out of a self-interested concern for one’s own soldiers and nationals.”). See Solis, *Law of Armed Conflict* at 10 (cited in Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War “states can implicitly agree on joint limits on the use of force as long as the limits make both states better off, each state can credibly threaten to retaliate against the other state for violating the limits, and each state cares enough about the future. The strategic problem is similar to the prisoner’s dilemma, and the solution is the same: mutual threats of retaliation.”⁴² The reciprocity thesis thus provides an appealingly parsimonious, if otherwise imperfect, view of first-order IHL rules—at least when stated at a very abstract level of generality.⁴³ The parsimony of simple models makes them useful, if blunt, tools for understanding and explaining what “states” do. When states are taking simple interests into account, with no exogenous moral constraints (or when such constraints have been assumed away for methodological or other reasons), state practice sometimes resembles an iterated prisoner’s dilemma or some similar game. Other times state practice does not re note 8) (“We obey the law of war if for no other reason than because reciprocity tells us that what goes around comes around...”) (emphasis added). See also Shane Darcy, The Evolution of the Law of Belligerent Reprisals, 175 Mil L Rev 184 (2004) (showing the preponderance of reciprocity-driven state practice before the adoption of the first law-of-war codes). Even within a rationalist framework it would be underinclusive to focus only on reciprocity, since the threat of retaliation for, and the reputational costs incurred as a result of, noncompliance are also important factors in a rationalist explanation. See Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works 33–38.\n⁴⁰ See Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 370–82 (cited in note 38).\n⁴¹ See id at 417–30.\n⁴² Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). See also Posner, manuscript at *6 (cited in note 38) (“Rules that make states jointly better off in one war but not in another war may be respected in the first war but will not be respected in the second.... When the conditions of reciprocity fail—as the war nears its end, when one belligerent does not have sufficient institutional structure—the laws of war will not be respected.”). Nor on this argument should they be respected, at least with regard to al-Qaeda terrorists, who do not themselves abide the laws of war. See, for example, Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 433 (cited in note 28) (“[T]he US cannot expect to gain any benefits from al Qaeda by treating al Qaeda prisoners in a humane manner given al Qaeda’s demonstrated ferocity in its treatment of enemy civilians.”).\n⁴³ Consider Posner, manuscript at *22 (cited in note 38) (noting that “[t]he logic of reciprocity can be understood using simple game theoretical models, which show that it is the key to self-enforcement in the repeated bilateral prisoner’s dilemma.”) (emphasis added).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 semble such games.⁴⁴ Moreover, their simplicity makes them inadequate for understanding the moral constraints that humanitarian law places on battlefield decisions, or the value-laden moral decisions that military officers and soldiers must make in determining, for example, whether or not to follow orders purporting to require the soldier to commit a war crime.⁴⁵ Its weakness is not its internal validity (whatever that may be⁴⁶), but rather its poor external validity with respect to state practice and the emerging consensus about whether and under what circumstances states may choose not to comply. Even some of the reciprocity thesis’s most vocal proponents admit, “states have recently shown a willingness to adapt the principle to changing conceptions of humanity in warfare.”⁴⁷ States recognize that the nonderogable nature of jus cogens norms does not permit them to defect merely because their adversaries defect. Similarly, the trends that raised states’ attention to the problems of suffering in wartime also helped shape and constitute the identity of modern professional militaries.⁴⁸ By assumption the reciprocity thesis discounts the role that ideas—here, soldiers’ professional identity—can play in channeling and constraining the menu of options from which a state might choose if its adversary were to defect. In short, the rationalist account’s heavy reliance on the reciproc ⁴⁴ See Douglas Baird, Robert Gertner &amp; Randal Picker, Game Theory and the Law 186 (suggesting that analysis of repeated games must be based on a model that “reflects such things as the uncertainty in the length of the game and in the payoffs that the players receive”) (emphasis added).\n⁴⁵ See Alford and Tierney, Moral Reasoning in International Law (cited in note 3).\n⁴⁶ Posner’s theory presents a positive as well as normative account for why “mutual threats of retaliation” are the solution to the IHL reciprocity problem. Posner, 5 Chi J Intl L at 427–28 (cited in note 28) (emphasis added). This is known as the tit-for-tat strategy. Scholars have long questioned whether players are made better off by adopting tit-for-tat reciprocity/retaliation postures in iterated games. See Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books 1984); Tony Ashworth, Trench Warfare 1914–1918: The Live and Let Live System (1980). Consider James D. Morrow, The Institutional Features of the Prisoners of War Treaties, 55 Intl Org 971, 975 (2001) (“Tit-for-tat responses to noisy signals of noncompliance] can lead to feuds of reciprocal punishments triggered by outside influences rather than to a defection from the agreement.”) (emphasis added). In light of that scholarly tradition, Posner’s adherence to the tit-for-tat posture is puzzling.\n⁴⁷ Watts, 50 Harv Intl L J at 368 (cited in note 38); id at 431 (“[S]tate practice vindicates the claim that states’ insistence on reciprocity has subsided over time.”).\n⁴⁸ See James Morrow, When Do States Follow the Laws of War? 101 Am Pol Sci Rev 559, 570 (2007) (“States then are more likely to comply with the laws of war when they have internalized those laws in their military training and [military] justice.

UPDATING THE ECONOMIC MODEL\n## A. Constrained Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe standard and rationalist accounts of IHL rules have their respective virtues. On one hand, the standard account shows good fit with state practice and doctrine, recognizing that deontological and consequentialist considerations have exerted real influence in the institutional evolution and substantive content of IHL rules. On the other hand, compared to the standard account, rationalist accounts generally provide superior methodological rigor. Yet such accounts have paid surprisingly little attention to the structure and content of IHL rules, and their focus on reciprocity is underinclusive.\nIt is possible to bridge the gap between the rationalist and standard accounts, taking advantage of the methodological advantages of the former and the substantive accuracy of the latter. Eyal Zamir and Barak Medina have proposed a new technique for incorporating threshold conditions from deontological reasoning into consequentialist analysis.⁴⁹ In the remainder of this paper, I employ their constrained CBA technique as a lens through which to analyze the interplay between humanitarian and pragmatic considerations in the design of IHL rules. In this draft I only briefly explain their approach before turning to a discussion of substantive IHL rules and the rules' implications under conditions of technological change and the emergence of cyberwarfare. I do so for space reasons, and in so doing I assume the reader at this preliminary stage is familiar with Zamir and Medina's thesis.\nConstrained CBA is a tool that recognizes the methodological advantages that economic analysis provides. It also recognizes the risk that pure consequentialist analysis, and pure deontological analysis, can lead to normative outcomes that many find morally repugnant.⁵⁰ It employs threshold deontology, a middle-ground framework for ana-\n⁴⁹ See generally Zamir and Medina, *Law, Economics and Morality* (cited in note 4).\n⁵⁰ See *id* at 19–20 (“Consequentialism does not recognize the moral rights of people over their body, labor, and talents.

They also reject Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule’s economic analysis of domestic counterterrorism policies, suggesting that the front-end “consequentialist underpinnings” and the back-end “implications” of their argument are both “unacceptable.” *Id* at 134, citing Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, *Terror in the Balance: Security, Liberty and the Courts* .\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342\nTierney\n[2011\nlyzing moral problems that gives credence to both kinds of concerns. As Gabriella Blum explains, the “threshold deontology” [position] acknowledges that some extreme points, one cannot avoid some consequentialist analysis that would require a departure from the absolute prescription.”51 Zamir and Medina import threshold deontology into mainstream economic analysis of law by providing the theoretical foundation and simple mathematical method for modeling dilemmas in which “the good outcomes of a certain act or a rule are sufficiently large to override a deontological constraint.”52\nConstrained CBA’s power as an analytical framework comes from its congruence with, and recognition of, both deontological and consequentialist concerns. The standard account described in Part I.A correctly understands that IHL rules reflect both kinds of concerns.53 Constrained CBA is the foundation on which scholars can undertake economic analysis of IHL rules while remaining sensitive to humanitarian as well as welfare-maximization considerations. Scope reasons have limited the extent to which I have been able to lay out the assumptions and details of Zamir and Medina’s theory. Moreover, I have assumed that readers of this draft have read their book. In a later draft, I will further expand this section.\n## B. The Positive Theory\nThe treaty and customary law of armed conflict reflect both kinds of concerns in different situations, in different ways, at different levels of abstraction, and at different points in the decision process. Sometimes humanitarian considerations form the core reason for an IHL rule or norm and are thus encoded from the outset in the balance the rule or norm strikes against military necessity. Consider the rule prohibiting armies from refusing quarter to enemy combatants rendered hors de combat.54 For simplicity I call these rules and norms “abso\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War Other times humanitarian considerations must be considered in light of the facts—leaving military officers, soldiers, or legal advisors to determine whether the consequences of acting (or not acting) are enough to satisfy a threshold constraint. Consider the rule permitting states to kill noncombatants who the enemy has illegally used as human shields if “the incidental loss or damage was proportionate to the military advantage expected.”56 These can be called “fact-sensitive” rules.\nStill other times the consequences will be so overwhelming in magnitude that countervailing humanitarian considerations effectively drop out of the calculus. Consider in this sense Michael Walzer’s defense of extreme measures taken in extreme emergencies or Gabriella Blum’s proposal for a “humanitarian necessity” exception to otherwise seemingly absolute IHL rules.57 Whatever the formal state of treaty or customary law, such necessity exceptions (following Blum) probably state practice, however (fortunately) rare that practice and such exceptions may be.58 Each of these kinds of situations can be modeled in qualitative as well as quantitative economic terms. In this paper I bracket any attempt to construct the formal model, but expect to return to the problem in future work. For now, the rest of this Part unfolds in two parts. First, I explain the structure of IHL in light of the incentives states have to purchase and provide military power. Second, I situate the purposes of IHL rules in light of this structure and these incentives, illustrating this analysis with examples selected from various first-order IHL rules.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 States facing an international conflict have a menu of options to choose from. For our purposes the two important options are bargaining and going to war. Under the traditional rationalist explanations, states will choose war when the net gains expected from doing so outweigh the net gains expected from continued bargaining.59 Should a state choose war, it will expend resources—war capital—in the run-up and execution of war. In the usual case, expenditures will come from the state treasury and will be spread across the population; by preparing, maintaining, and deploying defensive and offensive capabilities, states provide classic public goods.60 These goods are often very bad, however: war is a wasteful and inefficient use of resources.61 When rational states choose to go to war, they will also choose strategies and tactics that reduce the costs of doing so. Expenditures on the war effort will include not just fixed costs of procuring, supplying, and maintaining durable military hardware, but also the costs of maintaining the military bureaucracy, recruiting and retaining soldiers, and purchasing consumable goods such as butter for the mess hall or bombs for the airplanes. Soldiers can also be understood as consumable goods—at least as a historical matter. Technological and other structural changes in warfare have not only made the soldier less fungible, but also reduced the military necessity for treating the soldier as wholly consumable.62 Cost reduction strategies may manifest on the front end—constraining states' ability to make expenditures for those goods—as a consequence of political pressure. This is especially likely to be true where the decision to go to war has non-neutral distributive consequence.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War It is through these back-end concerns that states have come to converge on the treaty and customary IHL rules that govern, constrain, and channel the military benefits and collateral costs associated with given battlefield decisions. The rationalist account thus predicts that ex ante, states will prefer rules that prevent them from making such short-term decisions by binding them to serving longer-term interests such as bolstering force morale, reputation, and moral integrity, or reducing the likelihood of retaliation in future armed conflicts.64 The constrained CBA account takes threshold constraints into account and adds three additional predictions about states' ex ante preferences for these self-binding rules. First, states will settle and have settled upon absolute rules (like the rule against no-quarter declarations, or the rule against torture) when stakeholders and citizens register their respective preferences for deontological constraints.65 They will also prefer absolute rules where the march of civilization has forged a strong consensus view in favor of such constraints.66 If sufficiently entrenched, normative beliefs can have endogenous non-instrumental effects on how people select from a menu of options. Social taboos are one example, and deeply held religious views are another. Since people act more like threshold deontologists than pure consequentialists or pure deontologists, they will support rules that Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 implement first-order threshold constraints.⁶⁷ Through their human agents, states will thus similarly support rules that set deontological thresholds against certain battlefield practices.\nSecond, states-as-threshold-deontologists will balance the threshold constraint against the consequences. Sometimes states will use rule-utilitarian logic and strike the balance in advance; other times states will use act-utilitarian logic and permit decisionmakers to strike the balance on the battlefield or in a situation room. States will take other aspects of consequences into account as well: for instance, states will prefer rules that allow and facilitate risk shifting. Uncertainty increases the risk of harm to noncombatants, and efforts to reduce uncertainty shifts some quantum of this risk away from noncombatants to combatants.⁶⁸ States will thus prefer strong, clear rules where uncertainty about the military advantage to be gained from given conduct is very low or approaching zero. These rules are absolute and exceptional, respectively, based on the magnitude and direction of the military advantage. When the military advantage is very low and very certain, the consequences will be insufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. The result will be an absolute rule, a prediction seen in practice (as in the norm against killing civilians when there is no discernable military advantage). By contrast, when the military advantage is very high and very certain, the consequences will be so overwhelming that they will be easily sufficient to trigger the deontological threshold. State practice in equilibrium is likely to reflect states' beliefs that deontological thresholds are serious (for otherwise state practice would show constant defection), but not absolute. The result in these cases will likely be a necessity-exception rule, tracking Blum's proposal for a limited category of humanitarian necessity.⁶⁹ Third, and closely related, states will prefer tactics that maximize the military advantage expected to accrue from the marginal expenditure of war capital. Unfortunately for states—candidly, for everyone involved—battlefield uncertainty and the fog of war increase the risky tail of that expected military advantage. Expected advantage is necessarily speculative, and states will prefer rules that reduce the amount ⁶⁷ See generally Alford and Tierney, *Moral Reasoning* (cited in note 3); James Tierney, *Sovereign Power, Human Rights, and Hypocrisy Costs* (manuscript 2009), online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1482406.\n⁶⁸ See, for example, Blum, *Laws of War*, 35 Yale J Intl L at 46 (cited in note 5) (“Shifting the costs of uncertainty onto the potential attacker would encourage the attacker to be more careful in pursuing only those cases in which the humanitarian tradeoff is more certain.”).\n⁶⁹ Such rules will also track limited state practice in exceptional cases, such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See notes 57–58 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War Among equally effective tactics, states will chose less costly options. This is what makes self-binding rules somewhat counterintuitive, since such rules increase the costs associated with executing armed conflict.71 This counterintuitive result can be understood as a way to constrain the speculative military-advantage returns from the marginal expenditure of war capital. States can expend capital for war and other uses. As Posner has suggested, as military technology increases in efficiency, it has income effects and substitution effects on states' preferences for different bundles of investment in war and other uses.72 “[W]ith greater efficiency, the predatory returns gener Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 ated by an additional dollar invested in military capital will be greater than the share of productive returns generated by an additional dollar invested in productive capacity.”73 Since expenditure of war capital is wasteful, states will prefer IHL rules that constrain “the efficiency of military technology,” since such rules will channel states toward investing in non-war goods.74 Rules limiting efficiency are not the same as rules limiting destructiveness, in part because the former are measured relative to military advantage while the latter are absolute. In Posner’s view, destructive weapons have beneficial deterrence effects but harmful effects on “productive capital, defined broadly to include the human capital of civilians and of soldiers after they are demobilized.”75 Such effects are surely costly. But to the extent that destructive weapons increase the likelihood that those who pose no threat—such as non-combatants, or combatants rendered hors de combat—will be killed, they are also that much more likely to violate threshold constraints against killing such persons.\n## III. THE SPECIAL CASE OF CYBERWARFARE The constrained CBA account set out in the previous Part can help explain a wide range of treaty and customary IHL rules. Uncertainty, risk-shifting, threshold-constraint concerns, and cost-reduction preferences play important roles in shaping IHL rules, which in turn constrain and channel the tactical options states can select in carrying out armed conflict. In this part I shift focus by showing how these same concerns exert institutional-design effects when we are uncertain about what future battlefield situations will look like. I shift from explaining and understanding IHL rules as they currently exist, to explaining and understanding how states might seek to change those rules in light of anticipated (and even unknown) changes in battlefield technology.\nforces in terms of their efficiency—their ability to provide a greater quantum of military advantage for a given marginal war-capital expenditure. To the extent that states abide prohibitions on mercenaries, PMCs are good but imperfect substitutes for organized armed forces. Even so, states regularly turn to PMCs to serve logistical support and security functions. See Peter D. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War Parties to an armed conflict rarely experience technological parity with one another. Some armed conflicts occur because parties attempt to achieve technological parity. A state may learn that an adversary has developed new means of warfare that are more destructive or more efficient than previous means. In light of uncertainty about the adversary's intentions—whether purely defensive or also offensive—a rational state will seek to close the technological gap. This creates an unraveling or spiraling effect known as the security dilemma, in which both parties' attempts to close the gap make all worse off.76 To the extent that security dilemmas are a function of asymmetrical endowments of new technologies between potential adversaries, states may recognize that they will be jointly better off if they can ban or limit the use of such technologies.\nThese joint gains come in two types. First, there are classical gains to be had from limiting wasteful expenditure on arms races, as well as from reducing the risk of costs associated with damage—in particular, both direct military damage and collateral noncombatant damage. Second, there are gains to be had from reducing the uncertainty inherent to new technologies. This uncertainty includes not only the amount of suffering inflicted on combatants relative to the military advantage gained, but also the magnitude or even threshold presence of damage inflicted on noncombatants and noncombatant objects. Recall from earlier that uncertainty increases the risk that threshold constraints may be violated. All else equal, norm entrepreneurs are likely to advocate for, and states are likely to adopt, rules that reduce the risk of inadvertently violating a threshold constraint.\nSuch concerns have driven states to adopt these rules. In practice, however, they have had limited success in doing so. For example, before World War I, states unsuccessfully tried to place outright bans on aerial bombardment of undefended towns, then sought to\"regulat[e] the military potential by restricting [bombardment's] use under the law of armed conflict.\"77 Such limits will be difficult to achieve if they Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 affect states differently on account of technological asymmetries—arms gaps—at the time the treaty or custom is being developed.⁷⁸ As the world becomes increasingly networked in an absolute sense, relative technological asymmetries are likely to continue to grow, especially between more and less developed states. Such asymmetries mean that states are unlikely to converge on rules that limit the use of computer network attacks (CNAs)—an anticipated and emerging revolution in military means that commentators have unfortunately dubbed cyberwar.⁷⁹ Perhaps this is a good thing, for as commentators like Richard Clarke have warned, attempts to ban cyberwar are likely to tie the United States’ strategic hands in unsatisfying ways.⁸⁰ A century after states failed in banning and regulating aerial bombardment, problems of technological development and technological asymmetries will continue to puzzle policymakers, military officials, and lawyers. If the cyberwar threat is real and not overblown—a condition that is not necessarily satisfied—states will have to develop IHL rules that can account for the new means of networked warfare, and the uncertainty these means bring with regard to collateral consequences for noncombatants.\n## B. The Problems of Cyberwar Developments in telecommunications networks and computer systems have revolutionized modern life. They sharply reduce transaction costs in the public (business and government) as well as private spheres by allowing near-instantaneous transmission of information across thousands of miles. Interconnectedness is a virtue, but it is also a vice. If users are unsophisticated, they may open themselves to exploitation or to data or identity theft—without even knowing it. The infrastructure of the networks and systems themselves may also be ⁷⁸ See Posner, 70 U Chi L Rev at 310 (cited in note 2).\n⁷⁹ See Richard Clarke, *Cyber War*. I say this term is unfortunate because the term makes the threat posed by computer network attacks sound unserious—the stuff of science fiction rather than military reality. The question of definitions is sometimes important, since words like “warfare,” “attacks,” and “operations” frame the debate and can color our preferences about these issues. Compare Clay Wilson, *Information Operations and Cyberwar: Capabilities and Related Policy Issues* 5 (Congressional Research Service No RL31787, Sept 14, 2006), available online at http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31787.pdf (defining computer network attacks as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks”), with Maj. Arie J. Schaap, *Cyber Warfare Operations: Development and Use under International Law*, 64 Air Force L Rev 121, 125 (2009) (preferring the term computer network operations, defined as “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state”). For consistency with the literature, however, I use the term cyberwar in this paper.\n⁸⁰ See, for example, Clarke, *Cyber War* at 223–55 (cited in note 79).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War As concerning as these latter threats may be, it is important to distinguish them from cyberwar. Clarke defined the term to mean “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks fro the purposes of causing damage or disruption.”⁸² While we might quibble with this definition at the margins (such as its exclusion of cyber attacks in non-international armed conflicts), for our purposes it suffices to distinguish means of warfare from means of satisfying other illegitimate ends, such as theft or espionage.⁸³ The distinction also reflects the ends that network and systems exploitation are intended to serve: cyberwar is a means for engaging in armed conflict—whether as a prelude, supplement, or complement to it.⁸⁴ These means are more advanced and investment-intensive than might be apparent at first glance. Network systems and computer programs are far more complicated today than during the Reagan administration, when the film War Games suggested that computer networks were so vulnerable that a suburban teenager might casually stumble across a way to exploit nuclear missile launch systems.⁸⁵ I do not mean to say that networks do not remain vulnerable today to penetration and exploitation, but rather that the groups interested in doing so must be able and willing to incur substantial costs developing and implementing complex means of exploitation.⁸⁶ Consider the fol- ⁸¹ See generally id. See also Michael O’Hanlon, *Technological Change and the Future of Warfare* 61–64.\n⁸² Clarke, *Cyber War* at 6 (cited in note 79). This term and its definition are not inevitable. Consider note 79.\n⁸³ See Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 350–59 (cited in note 77) (exploring the differences between cyberwar attacks and computer network espionage). It is important not to over-emphasize what proportion of network and systems exploitation can be attributed to armed conflict as compared to other motivating reasons. Focusing on cyberwar to the exclusion of other international cooperation and coordination problems involving the internet “dramatically shapes policy perspectives. It militarizes what are mostly civil problems, and subordinates the protection of people and households to the protection of vaguely defined national interests conceived in terms of rarified interstate rivalries.” Milton Mueller, *Networks and States: The Global Politics of Internet Governance* 179.\n⁸⁴ See, for example, Blum, 2 J Leg Analysis at 142 (cited in note 25) (explaining that technological changes have reduced the need to kill soldiers to achieve military advantage, since other means, such as “cyber attacks on economic and utilities infrastructure,” can serve as substitutes); Wingfield, *Information Conflict* at 22 (cited in note 77) (“The technology of cyberspace adds new meaning to over-the-horizon warfare. Execution of an organized, large-scale attack can anonymously begin with distant key commands on a computer keyboard.”) (emphasis added).\n⁸⁵ See Clarke, *Cyber War* at 179 (cited in note 79).\n⁸⁶ Concerns about the consequences of cyberterrorism and non-international armed conflict are thus likely overblown. See id at 135 (calling cyberterrorism a “red herring”). If such attacks occurred at all, they would likely remain local in scope, but not inflict the scale of na Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 lowing illustrative (not exhaustive) examples. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to overwhelm a network “with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁸⁷ Viruses worms, and logic bombs can be planted surgically in systems, and can be designed to spread to unrelated computers (with scope and speed of replication limited only by the attributes of the systems they exploit). They can facilitate the “corruption or destruction” of data, and in the case of Trojan Horses can shift some amount of control over a network or system to the device’s designer.⁸⁸ Cyberwar is a largely untested means of warfare. There are few confirmed and documented instances of cyberwar, as distinguished from “cyberespionage” or “cybercrime.”⁸⁹ To the extent that sophisticated states might camouflage their cyberwar operations, covering their tracks, target states would find it difficult to determine whether an attack has occurred at all.⁹⁰ (Of course, should they so determine, we should expect them to respond as if they were attacked with kinetic weapons.) In addition to this front-end problem, there is a back-end problem: states tend to control (and keep classified) information about current military threats.⁹¹ Even when states are able to deter tionwide network vulnerability that commentators like Clarke find troubling about the potential for international cyberwar.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War Despite governments' tendency to keep facts about cyberwar attacks secret, not to mention their policies regarding cyberwar, publicly available information reveals several instances where states have engaged in true cyberwar. The first best example occurred the day before Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. In a move ultimately\"linked to the Russian intelligence apparatus,\"a vast network of computers launched coordinated attacks against government websites, national infrastructure, and the routers that linked Georgian internet service providers at the borders to service providers in other countries.92 Besides the tangible economic costs of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgian networks and systems—including\"an automated response at most of the foreign banks, which shut down connections to the Georgian banking sector\"93—the fog of war introduced other potential costs in the electronic battlefield. Clarke reports that\"volunteers... downloaded hacker software from several anti-Georgia websites [and] could join the cyber war by clicking on a button.\"94 This illustrates one of the four most serious concerns about cyberwar, at least from the perspective of those concerned with IHL rules: cyberwar substantially lowers the barriers for noncombatants to participate directly in hostilities. In the remainder of this paper, I present three major problems that arise in cyberwar operations: distinction, dual use targets, and direct participation. I include a brief discussion of the optimal IHL rules to deal with each cyberwar problem.\n\nThe major premise of IHL rules recognizes a difference between combatants and noncombatants, defined both in terms of their status and their conduct. Distinction rules recognize that, where noncombatants have not directly participated in hostilities, they may not be targeted in the same way as combatants. These principles underlie second-order decision rules, such as Additional Protocol I's admonition that\"when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\"95 These principles also Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 finds expression at lower levels of abstraction, such as in first-order rules banning specific means of warfare. Due to the weapons' nature, the state that deploys such weapons cannot limit their use only to combatants and military targets due to the nature of the weapons.96 Absolute rules, such as those that prohibit booby-trapping attractive objects like toys, food, or valuable consumer goods,97 recognize that military advantage to be gained from such means is per se insufficient to satisfy a threshold constraint against killing a noncombatant. Some balancing rules, by contrast, permit states to stockpile nuclear weapons because of their beneficial deterrence effects.98 Cyber weapons have the potential to be smarter than kinetic weapons. Innovative technological solutions to the distinction problem can permit states to target military personnel and objects with greater specificity than permitted even by\"smart\"bombs. Facts remain unclear surrounding the cyber attack on a computer system at an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, including whether the attack might be attributable to the Israeli government.99 Assuming the attack would be attributable, the incident is a good example of how cyber weapons can be designed to pinpoint a particular military object and selectively attack the software supporting that object. As in this case (or in the case of the supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, software that controls public utility infrastructure100) software controls real-world hardware devices, and attacks on the software can have devastating real-world consequences for those hardware systems. Once cyber weapon developers are able to understand the system architecture and program logic of their target objects—through cyber espionage or other means—states need only turn to further investment in human capital and technological solutions to develop weapons that exploit the features of target systems while avoiding civilian systems as much as possible.101 A state's failure to Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War The other side of the distinction principle imposes obligations on combatants to identify themselves. Signaling rules, such as the requirements that combatants wear a fixed emblem and carry their arms openly, reduce the uncertainty an adversary faces in targeting a group. Such rules ensure that threshold constraints against killing noncombatants are respected.¹⁰² However difficult it may be to determine whether kinetic attacks come from combatants or noncombatants who are directly participating in hostilities, the task is more difficult in cyber attacks.\nEven with techniques for tracing network traffic back to the systems from which they originated, sophisticated states seeking deniability (for *jus ad bellum* reasons) are likely to make investments in methods of obscuring the source of the attack. The attribution of cyber attacks can be a lengthy process, so investments made in routing network attacks through various countries, for example, will help buy an attacking state some time. Moreover, attribution processes may prove ultimately unsuccessful. States will thus face uncertainty about whether a cyber attack has come from another state, individuals affiliated with that state, or a group of unaffiliated individuals. This uncertainty is akin to the uncertainty experienced by the target of an attack by a camouflaged sniper. An optimal distinction rule for cyber attacks, like the distinction rule permitting camouflage as a “ruse of war,”¹⁰³ would permit cyber combatants to hide their superficial identity, as long as the attacking state’s identity could be ascertained upon close inspection of the weapon’s source code or the fingerprint of network traffic. At minimum, it would permit such ruses as long as the attacking state took advantage of features of network and system architecture that permitted it to hide its identity. The state could not puters. This exploitation of civilian objects seems a *de minimis* harm, and would probably be justified under proportionality principles anyway. See Part III.B.2.\n¹⁰² Query the extent to which this is true in light of the criticism that the distinction rules are effectively unenforceable because even those who violate emblem and open-carry requirements are still entitled to protections equivalent to POW protections. See Additional Protocol I, Art 44. Because these rules create incentives for combatants to hide their status, they shift some quantum of risk from combatants back onto noncombatants. Consider Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 50 (cited in note 11).\n¹⁰³ Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 44 (cited in note 11).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 employ the ruse by sourcing attacking traffic from civilian internet service providers or taking other steps to make the attack appear to have come from noncombatants.¹⁰⁴ Such a rule would reduce the uncertainty inherent to attributing network attack, thus shifting risk of retaliatory network attacks from noncombatants to combatants.\n## 2. Dual use targets.\nIHL rules are designed to limit military operations to targets calculated to achieve military advantage. The customary law expressed in Additional Protocol I limits states to attacks against military objectives, understood as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”¹⁰⁵ Commentators have extensively debated the appropriate interpretation of this provision, ranging from questions like how to assess definite military advantage to whether to characterize objectives as war-fighting or war-sustaining.¹⁰⁶ For our purposes, cyberwar targeting decisions are least problematic when they attack systems like the Iranian uranium enrichment facility, and most problematic when they attack dual use systems, which “serv[e] both the military and the civilian population of the enemy.”¹⁰⁷ Rules that permit attacks on dual use targets increase the risk of harm to civilians, while rules limiting attacks made primarily civilian-morale purposes decrease the risk of harm to civilians by introducing threshold constraints against such harms. Changes in technological means of warfare and the strategic orientation of modern armed forces have opened new debates about the appropriateness of targeting dual use targets. In previous eras, military strategy was oriented toward attrition, in which “the enemy is defeated by progressively weakening its military forces.”¹⁰⁸ Today, the strategy has shifted toward “immediate, first-order consequences” as well as “the delayed ¹⁰⁴ Compare the customary rule that camouflage is acceptable “as long as the combatants merely exploit the topographical conditions: the physical as distinct from the demographic landscape of civilians.” Id, citing Denise Bindschedler-Robert, *A Reconsideration of the Law of Armed Conflicts*, in *Report of the Conference on Contemporary Problems of the Law of Armed Conflict*, 1969 1, 43 (Carnegie Endowment 1971).\n¹⁰⁵ Additional Protocol I, Art 52(2).

In some of the more alarmist portions of his work, Richard Clarke envisions a nightmare scenario in which a foreign state launches pervasive nationwide attacks against critical infrastructure such as power grids, air traffic control systems, and financial data centers.¹¹¹ The interconnectedness of military and civilian systems—for example, the interpenetration of military air communications with civilian air traffic control systems, or military reliance on the main power grid—make those infrastructural systems legitimate targets of attack.¹¹² Recent customary-law decisions are clear on this point, at least with regard to power plants and power grids, as long as the military uses such systems.¹¹³ One way of protecting noncombatants from attacks on dual use networks, then, is to segregate military uses from civilian systems and networks—a suggestion that may be gaining traction in policy circles.\nSuch attacks will inevitably impose substantial costs on noncombatants who also use such systems. These are balancing rules, however, not absolute rules; they authorize battlefield decisions to determine whether the expected definite military advantage would satisfy a proportionality calculus with regard to the harm expected to accrue to noncombatants.¹¹⁴ States have attacked power plants, such as during the first Gulf War, even when doing so “rendered sewage plants in many civilian areas inoperable and left many hospitals without ¹⁰⁹ Id at 60, 62.\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, Conduct of Hostilities at 93 (cited in note 11).\n¹¹¹ Clarke, Cyber War at 65–68 (cited in note 79).\n¹¹² See id.\n¹¹³ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 125–46 (cited in note 25).

Nonetheless, such attacks might render air traffic control systems inoperable and might cripple the national economy, and such harms would have to be taken into account in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁶ But especially where such systems are insecure and vulnerable to cheap exploitation, states are likely to be tempted to target these systems, whatever the actual balance in the proportionality calculus.¹¹⁷ ## 3. Direct participation The final problem cyberwar operations poses for IHL rules concerns the ease with which civilians may participate in attacks. IHL rules protect noncombatants by default on account of their status, but also recognize that noncombatants can “lose[] their protection from attack... for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”¹¹⁸ As the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia explained, in language that “was not overruled on appeal,”¹¹⁹ the inquiry into whether a civilian has directly participated in hostilities (and thus becomes a legitimate subject of targeting) is a pragmatic, fact-sensitive question that “ascertain[s] whether, in each individual’s circumstances, that person was actively involved in hostilities at the relevant time.”¹²⁰ This balancing rule permits states to determine whether a noncombatant’s acts had “a direct causal relationship be ¹¹⁵ Id at 141 (citation omitted).\n¹¹⁶ By contrast, the state could not target war-sustaining “military” objectives such as the national market or economic infrastructure if they have an insufficiently “proximate nexus to ‘war fighting.’” Dinstein, *Conduct of Hostilities* at 96 (cited in note 11). Despite suggestions that certain conditions might make the national economy have a sufficient proximate nexus to permit targeting against it, those conditions have not been articulated clearly, and “the better conclusion” is that mere economic objectives may not be targeted. See Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 144 (cited in note 25). Consider, in this sense, the argument that economic targeting (for morale reasons) is self-defeating in practice. See note 30.\n¹¹⁷ This is especially true if they are relatively inelastic to the level of enforcement or retaliation for violating IHL prohibitions on targeting, or they are willing to discount the likelihood of serious cyber and kinetic attacks in response to the nationwide infrastructural cyber attack.\n¹¹⁸ Henderson, *Contemporary Law of Targeting* at 95 (cited in note 25).\n¹¹⁹ Id at 96.\n¹²⁰ Id, quoting *Prosecutor v Tadic* ¶ 616 (Trial Chamber), Case No IT-94-1 (ICTY May 7, 1997).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War In normal kinetic armed conflicts, civilians who take up arms against another party to the conflict are classical examples of those who directly participate in hostilities. In cyberwar attacks, the analysis is more cloudy, for civilians can be recruited into the service of cyber attackers without even knowing it. Noncombatants were invited to participate in the denial of service attacks on Georgian systems by downloading software and pressing a button,¹²² but we might imagine that a virus or worm might recruit noncombatants’ computers as elements of a “zombie” botnet¹²³ without any notice or steps taken by the computer’s operator. Threshold constraints currently prohibit targeting civilians who do not undertake “acts which by their nature and purpose are intended to cause actual harm” to the adversary’s forces.¹²⁴ Such intent-based rules should continue to protect civilians who inadvertently participate in cyberwar operations. Granted, such rules will give states incentives to recruit unwitting nationals (or even citizens of third states) to carry out distributed network attacks, thus increasing the risk that attacks will be more extensive, serious, and costly. On the other hand, such rules will continue to serve threshold constraints against targeting civilians.\nCivilians are protected by another rule in this context. The direct-participation standard requires not only “‘but for’ causation” but also “causal proximity to the foreseeable consequences of the act.”¹²⁵ In distributed network attacks, for example, no single civilian participant can be claimed to have but for causation, since that participant’s marginal contribution to the attack is vanishingly small. By contrast, the civilian who undertakes the substantial investments necessary to develop efficient and destructive offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, then carries out an attack, is more akin to the person who takes up arms than to the truck driver who merely serves the war effort (and without whose participation the harm to the adversary almost cer- ¹²¹ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 100 (cited in note 25), quoting Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmerman, eds, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 1679.\n¹²² See text accompanying notes 92–94.\n¹²³ See Clarke, Cyber War at 14–15, 24–25 (cited in note 79).\n¹²⁴ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101 (cited in note 25), quoting Sandoz, Swinarski, and Zimmerman, Commentary at 1942 (cited in note 121).\n¹²⁵ Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 103 (cited in note 25), quoting Michael Schmitt, ‘Direct participation in hostilities’ and 21st century armed conflict 508 (2004) (manuscript), available online at http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/humanrights/HUMR5503/h09/undervisningsmateriale/schmitt_direct_participation_in_hostlities.pdf.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 Tierney [2011 tainly would have still taken place).¹²⁶ Similarly, the civilian who works at a research university or is otherwise a contractor seeking to develop pure technical means of penetrating networks might be “participating” in cyberwar in an abstract, attenuated sense, but the causal proximity will continue to be insufficient to cause the contractor to lose protection.¹²⁷ Optimal cyberwarfare rules will thus continue to track the current rules that govern direct participation in hostilities in kinetic attacks. The only serious difference between optimal cyberwar rules and status quo rules involves the responses states can make to civilians who directly participate in cyber attacks. Even if civilians might be targeted during the time their computer systems were participating in distributed denial of service attacks, or during the time that their computer continued to host a virus or worm, the scope of “targeting” would have to be limited. Rules about direct participation are special cases of the default rule that there are threshold constraints against killing civilians. Where a civilian directly participates in hostilities, he becomes a military threat that may be neutralized, including with lethal force. The same reasons why Gabriella Blum identifies threshold constraints against killing soldiers who pose no active threat¹²⁸ apply with equal force in the direct participation context here. In short, civilians participating in network attacks might become the legitimate targets of states’ countermeasures, limited to technological means of neutralizing the threat posed by the computer system. Retaliatory denial of service attacks that would knock out the civilian’s access to network systems would satisfy military necessity considerations without reaching the absurd result that a civilian might be subject to a targeted killing for clicking a button on software.\n## CONCLUSION Threshold constraints matter to states, policymakers, military leaders, international norm entrepreneurs, and others. They find expression in a wide variety of customary and treaty-based IHL rules. Theories that privilege either a utilitarian or deontological rationale for IHL rules thus risk making serious category errors. By recognizing that some rules follow a logic of consequences and others follow a logic of appropriateness, scholars and practitioners are able in turn to make more nuanced arguments about the legality (or not) of some ¹²⁶ See Henderson, Contemporary Law of Targeting at 101–04 (cited in note 25).\n¹²⁷ Id at 106–09 (describing the rules governing scientists, researchers, and contractors).\n¹²⁸ See note 25.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342 2011] Threshold Constraints and Laws of War Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1762342"
