Introduction\nCurrent news headlines are full of claims of cyber incidents that cross national borders, in that they supposedly originate from inside one country and have effects in another.¹ These cyber incidents may or may not implicate State agents. For example, consider two recent claims. In the first example, many cyber researchers now claim that Russia provided cyber tools and access to Russian nationals to conduct cyber operations against Estonia in response to the proposed movement of a memorial.² In the second example, the United States claims that private individuals within China are invading US government and civilian networks and stealing intellectual property protected by law.³\n---\n* Associate Professor, Brigham Young University Law School.

To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes\nAs illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions,⁴ applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁵ and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.⁶\n4 UNGA Res 2625 (XXV) Declaration on Friendly Relations, 24 October 1970; UNGA Res 40/9, 6 November 1985.\n5 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v. India), Judgment on Jurisdiction of the Court, 21 June 2000, <www.icj-cij.org 119=\"\" 8088.pdf=\"\" 119=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">.\n6 Ibid., at para. 54.\n72</www.icj-cij.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14]\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and\n13 Lauterpacht, supra note 9, p. 102.\n14 UN Charter, Article 37; ibid., p. 99.\n15 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v.

The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods.²¹ In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*²² (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration²³ and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ.²⁴ Here, the\n20 J.

Reports* 18.\n75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.²⁵ This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts.²⁶ This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.²⁷\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm.²⁸ The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n25 *Ibid.*, at p. 22.\n26 *Tehran Hostages* case, paras. 67–68.\n27 *Trail Smelter* arbitration (US v. Canada), supra note 23, p. 1963. According to the Tribunal, “under the principles of international law ... no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence ...” (at p. 1965).\n28 *Corfu Channel* (UK v. Albania), supra note 24.\n76\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntain.²⁹ Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness.³⁰ A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n29 *Ibid.*\n30 *Brunnée, supra note 22.*\n77\nEric Talbot Jensen\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness.³¹ The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.³²\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups.³³ If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction³⁴ over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n31 M. N. Schmitt (ed.), *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Cambridge University Press, 2013) p.27.\n32 Ibid.\n33 D. E.

See Restatement on Foreign Relations, secs. 401–403.\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention,³⁵ many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.³⁶\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring.³⁷ It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*³⁸ and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration,³⁹ the *Corfu Channel* case,⁴⁰ and the *Pulp Mills* case.⁴¹ Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is\n35 Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime (2004), <www.coe.int c=\"\" default_en.asp=\"\" default_en.asp=\"\" economiccrime=\"\" dghl=\"\" coperation=\"\" t=\"\">, visited on 30 March 2014.\n36 For example, the “I love you” virus in 2000 did not allow the offender to be extradited to the US under the grounds of dual criminality.

In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43]\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44]\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n42 R. Jennings and A. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim's International Law*, Vol. I, 9th edition, Part I, p. 549, footnote 4.\n43 US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, para. 63.\n44 ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, commentary to Article 3, para. (11).\n45 Ibid.\n80\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State.⁴⁶ Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”.⁴⁷ Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State.⁴⁸ This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights.⁴⁹ While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”.⁵⁰ Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.⁵¹\n46 D.

For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States.⁵² The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result.⁵³ Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost”⁵⁴ to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.⁵⁵\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness.⁵⁶ Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.⁵⁷\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law.⁵⁸ While it was not included as a standard for\n⁵² *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n⁵³ *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n⁵⁴ *Ibid.*\n⁵⁵ Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch.

Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.⁶⁷\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n59 Commentary to Article 2 of the International Law Commission, Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N.Doc A/RES/56/83 (12 Dec. 2001).\n60 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n61 Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, para. 29; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Principle 21, 1972; Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, Principle 2, 1992.\n62 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n63 In the Alabama arbitration of 1872 between the United States and the United Kingdom, due diligence was defined as “a failure to use, for the prevention of an act which the government was bound to endeavour to prevent, such care as governments ordinarily employ in their domestic concerns, and may reasonably be expected to exert in matters of international interest and obligation.” (Case Presented on the Part of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty in Papers relating to Foreign Relations of the United States 1872 (United States Government Printing Office Washington 1872) part 2 vol I, 412; Koivurova, supra note 49.\n64 ILC Draft Articles, Article 3(10).\n65 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n66 UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Articles 4, 5; Koivurova, supra note 49.\n67 Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, at p. 420.\n83\nEric Talbot Jensen\nsteps towards achieving that result.⁶⁸ In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.⁶⁹\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.”⁷⁰ In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence.⁷¹ An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability.⁷² It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”.⁷³ For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm.⁷⁴ For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n68 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n69 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n70 ITLOS’s Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area; UNCLOS, Article 139.\n71 Nicaragua judgment, supra note 7, para. 157.\n72 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n73 Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, at p. 394.\n74 International Law Commission Commentary to Article 3 of the Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm; ITLOS’ Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n75 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, p. 549.\n76 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n77 UNCLOS Article 4, para. 4.\n78 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, pp. 550–551.\n79 Ibid., p. 549\n85\nEric Talbot Jensen\ndeterrence against similar future activities. $^{80}$  In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n80 Ibid., p. 509.\n81 1958 High Seas Convention.\n82 UNCLOS, Articles 27(4), 39(3)(a), 56(2) 58(3), 60(3), 66(3)(a), 79(5), 87(2), 142(1) 148, 161(4), 162(2)(d), 163(2), 167(2), 234, 267; appendix II, Article 2(1); appendix IV, Articles 51(1)-(2).\n83 Outer Space Treaty, Article IX.\n84 Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project, (Hungary/Slovakia), 1997 I.C.J. 7 (25 Sept. 1997) (Judgment).\n85 General Assembly Resolution 1803 on Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, GA Res. 1803 (XVII) / 17 UN GAOR Supp. (No.17) at 15 / UN Doc.

There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights.⁸⁸ With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”.⁸⁹ This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.⁹⁰\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines.⁹¹ Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests.⁹² States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State.⁹³ Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation.⁹⁴ Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n88 C.

For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”.⁹⁵ This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle.⁹⁶ While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n⁹⁵ 4 UNCLOS Commentary, para. 267.3(b).\n⁹⁶ Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n88\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nthe Stockholm⁹⁷ and Rio Declarations.⁹⁸ It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements.⁹⁹ Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm,¹⁰⁰ other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).¹⁰¹ No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general.¹⁰² Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law.¹⁰³ And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.¹⁰⁴\nThe principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n97 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Stockholm, June 1972.\n98 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Rio de Janiero, June 1992.\n99 World Charter for Nature 1982; Montreal Protocol 1987; Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development in ECE Region 1990; Ministerial Declaration of 3rd International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea; Bamako Convention 1991; 1992 UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes; Rio Declaration 1992; UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992; Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 1993; UN Fish Stocks Agreement 1995; Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; and Stockholm Convention 2000.\n100 See Nuclear Tests case, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion where he states the precautionary principle is an emerging norm of customary international law.\n101 See Schöder, supra note 86, paras. 119–120.\n102 Nuclear Test cases 1995, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion, para. 21.\n103 EC-Hormones Case (EU v. US 1998), NZ v. France (Nuclear Tests cases 1995), Southern Bluefin Tuna Cases (ITLOS, Aus v. Jap 1999), Pulp Mill Case, supra note 41.\n104 O. McIntyre and T. Mosedale, ‘The Precautionary Principle as a Norm of Customary International Law’, 9 J. of Envtl. Law 221 (1997); see Schröder, supra note 86.\n89\nEric Talbot Jensen\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n105 ‘Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle’, Science &amp; Environmental Health Network, 26 January 1988, <www.sehn.org wing.html=\"\">, visited on 22 March 2014.\n106 Crawford, supra note 18, p.358.\n107 Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n108 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n109 ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n110 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n111 EC Treaty, Article 174.</www.sehn.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.¹¹²\nBecause cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33.¹¹³ The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case,¹¹⁴ and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹¹⁵ and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.¹¹⁶\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.¹¹⁷\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk,¹¹⁸ the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n¹¹² ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n¹¹³ UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n¹¹⁴ *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n¹¹⁵ UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n¹¹⁶ UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n¹¹⁷ R.

Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other”¹²³ and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents.¹²⁴ Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.¹²⁵\n## 8. Conclusion\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development.\n119 UN Charter, Article 1(3).\n120 Antarctica Treaty, Articles 2, 3.\n121 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 27 Jan. 1967, 18 U.S.T. 2410, T.I.A.S.

To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes\nAs illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions, applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.\n\n72</www.icj-cij.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n\n73</www.globalresearch.ca></www.icj-cij.org>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nState’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14]\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and\n\nbetween Georgia and Russia, appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods. In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ. Here, the\n\n75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts. This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm. The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n\ntain. Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness. A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness. The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups. If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention, many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring. It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration, the *Corfu Channel* case, and the *Pulp Mills* case. Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is\n\n79</www.coe.int>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nan emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43]\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44]\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State. Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”. Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State. This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights. While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”. Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.\n\nSimilarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States. The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result. Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness. Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law. While it was not included as a standard for\n *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n *Ibid.*\n Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch. II, Articles 34–37.\n Brunnée, *supra* note 22.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 49.\n Koivurova, *ibid.*; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n\nState responsibility, the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations. Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.\nDue diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”. The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.\nThe duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n\nsteps towards achieving that result. In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.” In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence. An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability. It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”. For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm. For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n\ndeterrence against similar future activities. $^{80}$  In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n\nregard becomes customary international law, it would be binding as a standard on all States. There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights. With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”. This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines. Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests. States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State. Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation. Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n\ndue regard for the rights of other States. For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”. This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle. While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n\n Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n\nthe Stockholm and Rio Declarations. It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements. Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm, other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general. Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law. And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.\nThe principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.\nBecause cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33. The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case, and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk, the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n R. Wolfrum, ‘Cooperation, International Law of’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (2010).\n UN Charter, Articles 1(1), 33.\nEric Talbot Jensen\nian character; the rights and duties of States with respect to Antarctica, Outer Space and the Seabed, among others.\nThe obligation to cooperate with respect to cyber incidents is enshrined in the European Cyber Crime Convention which has 41 State parties and an additional 11 signatory States. Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other” and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents. Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.\n## 8. Conclusion\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development.",

    "### 1. Introduction": "Current news headlines are full of claims of cyber incidents that cross national borders, in that they supposedly originate from inside one country and have effects in another.¹ These cyber incidents may or may not implicate State agents. For example, consider two recent claims. In the first example, many cyber researchers now claim that Russia provided cyber tools and access to Russian nationals to conduct cyber operations against Estonia in response to the proposed movement of a memorial.² In the second example, the United States claims that private individuals within China are invading US government and civilian networks and stealing intellectual property protected by law.³\n---\n* Associate Professor, Brigham Young University Law School. The author would like to thank Brooke Robinson for her excellent research and review assistance.\nEric Talbot Jensen Both of these claims, and other recent claims, draw attention to State obligations with respect to cyber activities. To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully.

    "## 2. Cyber Disputes As illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.": "Articles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions,⁴ applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁵ and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.⁶ 72</www.icj-cij.org> State Obligations in Cyber Operations Due to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9 Note that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12 The remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that 73</www.globalresearch.ca></www.icj-cij.org> Eric Talbot Jensen State’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14] Whatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and between Georgia and Russia,²⁰ appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods.²¹ In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.",
    "## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure The previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.": "This rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*²² (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration²³ and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ.²⁴ Here, the 75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com> Eric Talbot Jensen Court stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.²⁵ This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts.²⁶ This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.²⁷ There are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm.²⁸ The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost certain.²⁹ Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness.³⁰ A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so will often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness.³¹ The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.³² The nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups.³³ If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction³⁴ over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com> State Obligations in Cyber Operations For parties to the European Cybercrime Convention,³⁵ many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.³⁶ If a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring.³⁷ It is to this question that this article will turn next.",
    "## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent In order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.": "This duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*³⁸ and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration,³⁹ the *Corfu Channel* case,⁴⁰ and the *Pulp Mills* case.⁴¹ Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is 79</www.coe.int> Eric Talbot Jensen an emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43] The costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44] In assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise to harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State.⁴⁶ Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”.⁴⁷ Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State.⁴⁸ This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights.⁴⁹ While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”.⁵⁰ Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.⁵¹ Similarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States.⁵² The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result.⁵³ Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost”⁵⁴ to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.⁵⁵ In applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness.⁵⁶ Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.⁵⁷ To the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law.⁵⁸ While it was not included as a standard for ⁵² *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n⁵³ *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n⁵⁴ *Ibid.* ⁵⁵ Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch. II, Articles 34–37.\n⁵⁶ Brunnée, *supra* note 22.\n⁵⁷ Koivurova, *supra* note 49.\n⁵⁸ Koivurova, *ibid.*; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\nState responsibility,⁵⁹ the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations.⁶⁰ Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law⁶¹ and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.⁶² Due diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance.⁶³ Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”.⁶⁴ The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.⁶⁵ In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.⁶⁶ The duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.⁶⁷ As with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary steps towards achieving that result.⁶⁸ In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.⁶⁹ This was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.”⁷⁰ In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence.⁷¹ An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability.⁷² It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”.⁷³ For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm.⁷⁴ For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns State Obligations in Cyber Operations and operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77 This same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79 In some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of deterrence against similar future activities. In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.",
    "# 5. Due Regard In addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.": "This emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources and the environment, including during times of armed conflict. To the extent that the principle of due regard becomes customary international law, it would be binding as a standard on all States. There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights.⁸⁸ With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”.⁸⁹ This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.⁹⁰ There is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines.⁹¹ Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests.⁹² States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State.⁹³ Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation.⁹⁴ Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\ndue regard for the rights of other States. For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”.⁹⁵ This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.",
    "## 6. Precautionary Principle Another emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle.⁹⁶ While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.": "This obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in ⁹⁵ 4 UNCLOS Commentary, para. 267.3(b).\n⁹⁶ Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\nthe Stockholm⁹⁷ and Rio Declarations.⁹⁸ It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements.⁹⁹ Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm,¹⁰⁰ other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).¹⁰¹ No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general.¹⁰² Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law.¹⁰³ And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.¹⁰⁴ The principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105 As a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106\"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107 The precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is\"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be: proportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109 States have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111\"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten State Obligations in Cyber Operations tially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.¹¹² Because cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.",
    "## 7. International Cooperation Finally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.": "This obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33.¹¹³ The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case,¹¹⁴ and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹¹⁵ and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.¹¹⁶ For the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.¹¹⁷ In addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk,¹¹⁸ the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar- ¹¹² ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n¹¹³ UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n¹¹⁴ *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n¹¹⁵ UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n¹¹⁶ UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n¹¹⁷ R. Wolfrum, ‘Cooperation, International Law of’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (2010).\n¹¹⁸ UN Charter, Articles 1(1), 33.\nEric Talbot Jensen ian character;¹¹⁹ the rights and duties of States with respect to Antarctica,¹²⁰ Outer Space¹²¹ and the Seabed,¹²² among others.\nThe obligation to cooperate with respect to cyber incidents is enshrined in the European Cyber Crime Convention which has 41 State parties and an additional 11 signatory States. Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other”¹²³ and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents.¹²⁴ Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.¹²⁵ ## 8. Conclusion The law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development."

Introduction\nCurrent news headlines are full of claims of cyber incidents that cross national borders, in that they supposedly originate from inside one country and have effects in another. These cyber incidents may or may not implicate State agents. For example, consider two recent claims. In the first example, many cyber researchers now claim that Russia provided cyber tools and access to Russian nationals to conduct cyber operations against Estonia in response to the proposed movement of a memorial. In the second example, the United States claims that private individuals within China are invading US government and civilian networks and stealing intellectual property protected by law.\n---\n* Associate Professor, Brigham Young University Law School.

To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes\nAs illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions, applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.\n\n72</www.icj-cij.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n\n73</www.globalresearch.ca></www.icj-cij.org>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nState’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14]\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and\n\nbetween Georgia and Russia, appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods. In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ. Here, the\n\n75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts. This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm. The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n\ntain. Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness. A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness. The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups. If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention, many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring. It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration, the *Corfu Channel* case, and the *Pulp Mills* case. Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is\n\n79</www.coe.int>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nan emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43]\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44]\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State. Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”. Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State. This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights. While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”. Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.\n\nSimilarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States. The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result. Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness. Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law. While it was not included as a standard for\n *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n *Ibid.*\n Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch. II, Articles 34–37.\n Brunnée, *supra* note 22.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 49.\n Koivurova, *ibid.*; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n\nState responsibility, the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations. Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.\nDue diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”. The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.\nThe duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n\nsteps towards achieving that result. In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.” In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence. An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability. It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”. For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm. For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n\ndeterrence against similar future activities. $^{80}$  In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n\nregard becomes customary international law, it would be binding as a standard on all States. There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights. With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”. This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines. Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests. States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State. Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation. Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n\ndue regard for the rights of other States. For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”. This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle. While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n\n Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n\nthe Stockholm and Rio Declarations. It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements. Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm, other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general. Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law. And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.\nThe principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.\nBecause cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33. The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case, and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk, the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n R. Wolfrum, ‘Cooperation, International Law of’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (2010).\n UN Charter, Articles 1(1), 33.\nEric Talbot Jensen\nian character; the rights and duties of States with respect to Antarctica, Outer Space and the Seabed, among others.\nThe obligation to cooperate with respect to cyber incidents is enshrined in the European Cyber Crime Convention which has 41 State parties and an additional 11 signatory States. Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other” and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents. Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.\n## 8. Conclusion\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development.",

Introduction\nCurrent news headlines are full of claims of cyber incidents that cross national borders, in that they supposedly originate from inside one country and have effects in another. These cyber incidents may or may not implicate State agents. For example, consider two recent claims. In the first example, many cyber researchers now claim that Russia provided cyber tools and access to Russian nationals to conduct cyber operations against Estonia in response to the proposed movement of a memorial. In the second example, the United States claims that private individuals within China are invading US government and civilian networks and stealing intellectual property protected by law.\n---\n* Associate Professor, Brigham Young University Law School.

To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes\nAs illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions, applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.\n\n72</www.icj-cij.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n\n73</www.globalresearch.ca></www.icj-cij.org>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nState’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14]\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and\n\nbetween Georgia and Russia, appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods. In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ. Here, the\n\n75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”. This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts. This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm. The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n\ntain. Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness. A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness. The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups. If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention, many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring. It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas* and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration, the *Corfu Channel* case, and the *Pulp Mills* case. Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is\n\n79</www.coe.int>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nan emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43]\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44]\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State. Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”. Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State. This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights. While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”. Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.\n\nSimilarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States. The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result. Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness. Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law. While it was not included as a standard for\n *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n *Ibid.*\n Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch. II, Articles 34–37.\n Brunnée, *supra* note 22.\n Koivurova, *supra* note 49.\n Koivurova, *ibid.*; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n\nState responsibility, the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations. Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.\nDue diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”. The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.\nThe duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n\nsteps towards achieving that result. In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.” In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence. An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability. It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”. For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm. For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n\ndeterrence against similar future activities. $^{80}$  In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n\nregard becomes customary international law, it would be binding as a standard on all States. There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights. With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”. This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines. Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests. States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State. Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation. Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n\ndue regard for the rights of other States. For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”. This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle. While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n\n Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n\nthe Stockholm and Rio Declarations. It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements. Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm, other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general. Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law. And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.\nThe principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.\nBecause cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33. The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case, and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk, the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n R. Wolfrum, ‘Cooperation, International Law of’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (2010).\n UN Charter, Articles 1(1), 33.\nEric Talbot Jensen\nian character; the rights and duties of States with respect to Antarctica, Outer Space and the Seabed, among others.\nThe obligation to cooperate with respect to cyber incidents is enshrined in the European Cyber Crime Convention which has 41 State parties and an additional 11 signatory States. Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other” and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents. Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.\n## 8. Conclusion\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development."

To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes\nAs illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions,⁴ applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁵ and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.⁶\n4 UNGA Res 2625 (XXV) Declaration on Friendly Relations, 24 October 1970; UNGA Res 40/9, 6 November 1985.\n5 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v. India), Judgment on Jurisdiction of the Court, 21 June 2000, <www.icj-cij.org 119=\"\" 8088.pdf=\"\" 119=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">.\n6 Ibid., at para. 54.\n72</www.icj-cij.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33. However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith. This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”. All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim. Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia, and\n13 Lauterpacht, supra note 9, p. 102.\n14 UN Charter, Article 37; ibid., p. 99.\n15 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v.

The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods.²¹ In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*²² (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration²³ and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ.²⁴ Here, the\n20 J.

Reports* 18.\n75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com>\nEric Talbot Jensen\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.²⁵ This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts.²⁶ This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.²⁷\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm.²⁸ The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n25 *Ibid.*, at p. 22.\n26 *Tehran Hostages* case, paras. 67–68.\n27 *Trail Smelter* arbitration (US v. Canada), supra note 23, p. 1963. According to the Tribunal, “under the principles of international law ... no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury ... in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence ...” (at p. 1965).\n28 *Corfu Channel* (UK v. Albania), supra note 24.\n76\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntain.²⁹ Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness.³⁰ A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n29 *Ibid.*\n30 *Brunnée, supra note 22.*\n77\nEric Talbot Jensen\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness.³¹ The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.³²\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups.³³ If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction³⁴ over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n31 M. N. Schmitt (ed.), *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (Cambridge University Press, 2013) p.27.\n32 Ibid.\n33 D. E.

See Restatement on Foreign Relations, secs. 401–403.\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention,³⁵ many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.³⁶\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring.³⁷ It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*³⁸ and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration,³⁹ the *Corfu Channel* case,⁴⁰ and the *Pulp Mills* case.⁴¹ Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is\n35 Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime (2004), <www.coe.int c=\"\" default_en.asp=\"\" default_en.asp=\"\" economiccrime=\"\" dghl=\"\" coperation=\"\" t=\"\">, visited on 30 March 2014.\n36 For example, the “I love you” virus in 2000 did not allow the offender to be extradited to the US under the grounds of dual criminality.

In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”, that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm. The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n42 R. Jennings and A. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim's International Law*, Vol. I, 9th edition, Part I, p. 549, footnote 4.\n43 US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, para. 63.\n44 ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, commentary to Article 3, para. (11).\n45 Ibid.\n80\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State.⁴⁶ Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”.⁴⁷ Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State.⁴⁸ This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights.⁴⁹ While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”.⁵⁰ Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.⁵¹\n46 D.

Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States.⁵² The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result.⁵³ Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost”⁵⁴ to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.⁵⁵\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness.⁵⁶ Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.⁵⁷\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law.⁵⁸ While it was not included as a standard for\n⁵² *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n⁵³ *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n⁵⁴ *Ibid.*\n⁵⁵ Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch.

Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.⁶⁷\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n59 Commentary to Article 2 of the International Law Commission, Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N.Doc A/RES/56/83 (12 Dec. 2001).\n60 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n61 Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, para. 29; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Principle 21, 1972; Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, Principle 2, 1992.\n62 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n63 In the Alabama arbitration of 1872 between the United States and the United Kingdom, due diligence was defined as “a failure to use, for the prevention of an act which the government was bound to endeavour to prevent, such care as governments ordinarily employ in their domestic concerns, and may reasonably be expected to exert in matters of international interest and obligation.” (Case Presented on the Part of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty in Papers relating to Foreign Relations of the United States 1872 (United States Government Printing Office Washington 1872) part 2 vol I, 412; Koivurova, supra note 49.\n64 ILC Draft Articles, Article 3(10).\n65 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n66 UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Articles 4, 5; Koivurova, supra note 49.\n67 Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, at p. 420.\n83\nEric Talbot Jensen\nsteps towards achieving that result.⁶⁸ In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.⁶⁹\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.”⁷⁰ In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence.⁷¹ An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability.⁷² It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”.⁷³ For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm.⁷⁴ For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n68 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n69 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n70 ITLOS’s Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area; UNCLOS, Article 139.\n71 Nicaragua judgment, supra note 7, para. 157.\n72 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n73 Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, at p. 394.\n74 International Law Commission Commentary to Article 3 of the Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm; ITLOS’ Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n75 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, p. 549.\n76 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n77 UNCLOS Article 4, para. 4.\n78 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, pp. 550–551.\n79 Ibid., p. 549\n85\nEric Talbot Jensen\ndeterrence against similar future activities. $^{80}$  In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n80 Ibid., p. 509.\n81 1958 High Seas Convention.\n82 UNCLOS, Articles 27(4), 39(3)(a), 56(2) 58(3), 60(3), 66(3)(a), 79(5), 87(2), 142(1) 148, 161(4), 162(2)(d), 163(2), 167(2), 234, 267; appendix II, Article 2(1); appendix IV, Articles 51(1)-(2).\n83 Outer Space Treaty, Article IX.\n84 Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project, (Hungary/Slovakia), 1997 I.C.J. 7 (25 Sept. 1997) (Judgment).\n85 General Assembly Resolution 1803 on Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, GA Res. 1803 (XVII) / 17 UN GAOR Supp. (No.17) at 15 / UN Doc.

There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights.⁸⁸ With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”.⁸⁹ This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.⁹⁰\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines.⁹¹ Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests.⁹² States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State.⁹³ Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation.⁹⁴ Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n88 C.

For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”.⁹⁵ This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle.⁹⁶ While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n⁹⁵ 4 UNCLOS Commentary, para. 267.3(b).\n⁹⁶ Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n88\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\nthe Stockholm⁹⁷ and Rio Declarations.⁹⁸ It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements.⁹⁹ Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm,¹⁰⁰ other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).¹⁰¹ No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general.¹⁰² Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law.¹⁰³ And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.¹⁰⁴\nThe principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n97 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Stockholm, June 1972.\n98 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Rio de Janiero, June 1992.\n99 World Charter for Nature 1982; Montreal Protocol 1987; Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development in ECE Region 1990; Ministerial Declaration of 3rd International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea; Bamako Convention 1991; 1992 UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes; Rio Declaration 1992; UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992; Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 1993; UN Fish Stocks Agreement 1995; Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; and Stockholm Convention 2000.\n100 See Nuclear Tests case, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion where he states the precautionary principle is an emerging norm of customary international law.\n101 See Schöder, supra note 86, paras. 119–120.\n102 Nuclear Test cases 1995, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion, para. 21.\n103 EC-Hormones Case (EU v. US 1998), NZ v. France (Nuclear Tests cases 1995), Southern Bluefin Tuna Cases (ITLOS, Aus v. Jap 1999), Pulp Mill Case, supra note 41.\n104 O. McIntyre and T. Mosedale, ‘The Precautionary Principle as a Norm of Customary International Law’, 9 J. of Envtl. Law 221 (1997); see Schröder, supra note 86.\n89\nEric Talbot Jensen\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n105 ‘Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle’, Science &amp; Environmental Health Network, 26 January 1988, <www.sehn.org wing.html=\"\">, visited on 22 March 2014.\n106 Crawford, supra note 18, p.358.\n107 Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n108 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n109 ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n110 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n111 EC Treaty, Article 174.</www.sehn.org>\nState Obligations in Cyber Operations\ntially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.¹¹²\nBecause cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33.¹¹³ The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case,¹¹⁴ and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹¹⁵ and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.¹¹⁶\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.¹¹⁷\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk,¹¹⁸ the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n¹¹² ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n¹¹³ UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n¹¹⁴ *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n¹¹⁵ UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n¹¹⁶ UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n¹¹⁷ R.

Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other”¹²³ and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents.¹²⁴ Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.¹²⁵\n## 8. Conclusion\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development.\n119 UN Charter, Article 1(3).\n120 Antarctica Treaty, Articles 2, 3.\n121 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 27 Jan. 1967, 18 U.S.T. 2410, T.I.A.S.

Introduction\nCurrent news headlines are full of claims of cyber incidents that cross national borders, in that they supposedly originate from inside one country and have effects in another.¹ These cyber incidents may or may not implicate State agents. For example, consider two recent claims. In the first example, many cyber researchers now claim that Russia provided cyber tools and access to Russian nationals to conduct cyber operations against Estonia in response to the proposed movement of a memorial.² In the second example, the United States claims that private individuals within China are invading US government and civilian networks and stealing intellectual property protected by law.³\n---\n* Associate Professor, Brigham Young University Law School. The author would like to thank Brooke Robinson for her excellent research and review assistance.\n\nEric Talbot Jensen Both of these claims, and other recent claims, draw attention to State obligations with respect to cyber activities. To what extent must these nations resolve their dispute peacefully? Must nations control their cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is not used to harm others? Are Russia and China responsible for the actions of individuals within their territory?\nThis article will argue that States must solve their cyber disputes peacefully, and that they have an emerging duty of due diligence to monitor their networks in order to prevent them from being used to cause transboundary harm to other nations and in some cases, to other non-State actors.\nPart 2 will introduce the issue of cyber disputes generally and discuss the international obligation to resolve disputes peacefully. Part 3 will argue that a State cannot knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. Part 4 will discuss a State's emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence. Part 5 will argue that a State must act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities. Part 6 will analyse the precautionary principle and its impact on transboundary cyber harm. Part 7 will discuss the international law obligation to cooperate in response to cyber harm. The article will conclude in Part 8.\n## 2. Cyber Disputes As illustrated briefly above, cyber disputes are a common occurrence between nations. No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions,⁴ applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁵ and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.⁶ 72</www.icj-cij.org> State Obligations in Cyber Operations Due to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9 Note that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12 The remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that 73</www.globalresearch.ca></www.icj-cij.org> Eric Talbot Jensen State’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14] Whatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and between Georgia and Russia,²⁰ appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods.²¹ In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure The previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*²² (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration²³ and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ.²⁴ Here, the 75</www.cnycentral.com></www.foxnews.com> Eric Talbot Jensen Court stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.²⁵ This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts.²⁶ This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.²⁷ There are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm.²⁸ The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost certain.²⁹ Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness.³⁰ A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so will often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness.³¹ The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.³² The nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups.³³ If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction³⁴ over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n\n78</www.foreignpolicy.com> State Obligations in Cyber Operations For parties to the European Cybercrime Convention,³⁵ many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.³⁶ If a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring.³⁷ It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent In order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*³⁸ and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration,³⁹ the *Corfu Channel* case,⁴⁰ and the *Pulp Mills* case.⁴¹ Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law. To the extent that it is 79</www.coe.int> Eric Talbot Jensen an emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43] The costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44] In assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise to harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State.⁴⁶ Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”.⁴⁷ Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State.⁴⁸ This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights.⁴⁹ While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”.⁵⁰ Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.⁵¹ Similarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States.⁵² The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result.⁵³ Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost”⁵⁴ to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.⁵⁵ In applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness.⁵⁶ Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.⁵⁷ To the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law.⁵⁸ While it was not included as a standard for ⁵² *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n⁵³ *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n⁵⁴ *Ibid.* ⁵⁵ Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch. II, Articles 34–37.\n⁵⁶ Brunnée, *supra* note 22.\n⁵⁷ Koivurova, *supra* note 49.\n⁵⁸ Koivurova, *ibid.*; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n\nState responsibility,⁵⁹ the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations.⁶⁰ Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law⁶¹ and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.⁶² Due diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance.⁶³ Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”.⁶⁴ The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.⁶⁵ In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.⁶⁶ The duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.⁶⁷ As with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary steps towards achieving that result.⁶⁸ In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.⁶⁹ This was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.”⁷⁰ In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence.⁷¹ An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability.⁷² It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”.⁷³ For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm.⁷⁴ For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns State Obligations in Cyber Operations and operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77 This same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79 In some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of deterrence against similar future activities. In the cyber context, the passing of laws against harmful cyber activities and the subsequent prosecution of cyber hacktivists who conduct transboundary cyber harm will support a State's claim of due diligence, provided the State also monitors its networks in an effort to find wrongdoers who it can then prosecute.\nThis duty to monitor and prevent, and its accompanying standard of due diligence is not yet a principle of customary international law with respect to cyber activities by States. However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n# 5. Due Regard In addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources and the environment, including during times of armed conflict. To the extent that the principle of due regard becomes customary international law, it would be binding as a standard on all States. There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights.⁸⁸ With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”.⁸⁹ This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.⁹⁰ There is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines.⁹¹ Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests.⁹² States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State.⁹³ Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation.⁹⁴ Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n\ndue regard for the rights of other States. For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”.⁹⁵ This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n## 6. Precautionary Principle Another emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle.⁹⁶ While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in ⁹⁵ 4 UNCLOS Commentary, para. 267.3(b).\n⁹⁶ Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n\nthe Stockholm⁹⁷ and Rio Declarations.⁹⁸ It has been incorporated in numerous international agreements.⁹⁹ Though the ICJ has been hesitant to declare it as a customary norm,¹⁰⁰ other tribunals have done so, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).¹⁰¹ No major international courts or tribunals have explicitly rejected the principle as customary international law, and recent cases indicate more support for the principle in general.¹⁰² Further, the majority of States participating in international proceedings concerning the principle claim that it is customary international law.¹⁰³ And the majority of scholars confirm the likelihood that it has reached the level of customary international law, at least with respect to the environment.¹⁰⁴ The principle will at least apply to State parties of various international agreements where the principle has been adopted. It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105 As a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106\"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107 The precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is\"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be: proportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109 States have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111\"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten State Obligations in Cyber Operations tially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen for the Community”.¹¹² Because cyber activities are susceptible to scientific uncertainty and risk, they are likely to be the target of future applications of the precautionary principle. Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n## 7. International Cooperation Finally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33.¹¹³ The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case,¹¹⁴ and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹¹⁵ and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.¹¹⁶ For the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.¹¹⁷ In addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk,¹¹⁸ the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar- ¹¹² ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n¹¹³ UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n¹¹⁴ *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n¹¹⁵ UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n¹¹⁶ UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n¹¹⁷ R.

Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other”¹²³ and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents.¹²⁴ Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.¹²⁵ ## 8. Conclusion The law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development."

No cyber dispute has yet resulted in armed conflict, but that is no guarantee for the future. Since it appears that cyber disputes will continue and potentially increase in quantity and significance, it is important to analyse the international law concerning dispute resolution and how that body of law might handle cyber disputes.\n\nArticles 2(3), 2(4) and 33–38 of the United Nations (UN) Charter form the current legal paradigm for international dispute resolution. The guiding principle to be gleaned from these references is that States have an obligation to resolve their disputes peacefully. This same principle has been stated in multiple General Assembly statements and resolutions,⁴ applied in numerous decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁵ and has been duplicated in many bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties.⁶\n\n4 UNGA Res 2625 (XXV) Declaration on Friendly Relations, 24 October 1970; UNGA Res 40/9, 6 November 1985.\n\n5 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v.

    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nDue to the universal application of the UN Charter (all States are Parties to the UN Charter), the obligation to solve disputes peacefully is accepted not only as a matter of binding treaty obligation, but also as a matter of customary international law that governs the relationships of all States.7 This legal obligation does not apply to purely internal disputes,8 but a dispute which endangers international peace and security is no longer considered an internal dispute.9\n\nNote that this obligation to resolve disputes peacefully is not an obligation to solve all disputes. The only disputes which must be resolved are those which endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.10 Historically, there have not been purely cyber disputes which States have accepted as fitting into this obligation. Difficulties with timely attribution have limited the capacity to recognise cyber conflicts that might have reached this level. For example, the Flame malware was allegedly created and executed by the United States as an information gathering tool.11 If the countries which were targeted by the malware had been able to attribute the malware in a timely manner, this situation might have developed into a dispute that threatened international peace and security. If so, the States involved would have had a legal obligation to resolve the dispute peacefully.\n\nThere is no obligation to resolve disputes that do not threaten international peace and security. States may choose to attempt to resolve such a dispute, or not. However, if attempts to settle that dispute are made, those methods must be peaceful and comply with the requirements of Article 33 et seq.\n\nArticle 33 obliges all States to seek alternate methods of dispute resolution to the use of force. “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.”12\n\nThe remaining article in Chapter VI of the UN Charter outlines other methodologies for peaceful resolution of disputes, including the role that the Security Council might play in that. However, though States are obliged under international law to settle certain disputes peacefully, the choice of means whereby they settle the dispute is a matter of decision for the State. Article 33 lists a number of options that\n\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nState’s might choose but is not meant to be exclusive. States are free to elect whatever methods they prefer, as long as they are peaceful methods.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement to use the methods proposed in Article 33 does not mean that such methods must all be exhausted or that lengthy attempts are required. For example, an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a resolution, however brief, will technically meet the requirement of Article 33.[13] However, an unsuccessful attempt does not fulfil the State’s obligation. The obligation to settle disputes peacefully is an on-going obligation that does not extinguish because various attempts have failed. If States fail to resolve their dispute by peaceful means, and determine that no further attempts will be useful, they must take the dispute to the Security Council for resolution.[14]\n\nWhatever means a State may choose to settle an international dispute, it must act in good faith.[15] This principle is both a treaty obligation and a customary obligation. The treaty obligation comes from the UN Charter which requires “[a]ll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter”.[16] All States, as parties to the UN Charter, have embraced this obligation.\n\nThe customary norm stems from Roman Law and Christian Law doctrine[17] and has its roots in the maxim “pacta sunt servanda” which requires States to comply with their obligations in good faith. There has never been a case in which an international court or tribunal has challenged the validity of this maxim.[18] Good faith is a broad but fundamental principle in international law.\n\nIf the cyber dispute between States is based on actions that fall below the use of force threshold, but still unlawful under international law, the obligation to resolve a dispute peacefully does not preclude a State from responding to cyber activities with lawful means such as countermeasures. These measures can be taken in conjunction with the settlement methods listed in Article 33, or other peaceful means of dispute settlement. Alternatively, if the State is a target of cyber actions that amount to an armed attack in violation of Article 51, that State may respond in self-defence without consideration of using only peaceful means of dispute resolution.\n\nMore frequently in today’s world, States are the victims of cyber activities from non-State actors. For example, the cyber incidents between Estonia and Russia,[19] and\n\n13 Lauterpacht, supra note 9, p. 102.\n14 UN Charter, Article 37; ibid., p. 99.\n15 Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 10 August 1999 (Pakistan v.

    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nbetween Georgia and Russia,²⁰ appear to have been orchestrated by civilian hacktivists. The application of the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter is unclear with respect to non-State actors in a “below the threshold” dispute with a State. There is no consensus that the obligations of Article 2(3) apply to States in their dealings with non-State actors.\n\nThere is no requirement in international law to respond to a cyber dispute that is not a use of force or an armed attack by using cyber methods.²¹ In conjunction with other peaceful settlement methods, States may also resort to both cyber and non-cyber responses as long as they do not rise to the level of a use of force or violate international law.\n\nRegardless of the source of the dispute, States have an obligation to solve all disputes which might threaten international peace and security peacefully. Even those disputes which are not a risk to international peace and security must be solved peacefully if a State elects to solve it. The rest of this article will discuss existing and emerging duties that support this obligation.\n\n## 3. Controlling Cyber Infrastructure\n\nThe previous part of this article introduced the fact that many States are mere transit States for the harm that originates in some other State’s territory, whether generated by another State or a non-State actor. What responsibility, if any, does the transit State have in that case? The international law principle simply says that a State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States.\n\nThis rule is based on a long line of customary international law beginning with the maxim *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*²² (use your own property in such a manner as not to injure that of another) and continuing through such pronouncements as the Trail Smelter arbitration²³ and the Corfu Channel case of the ICJ.²⁴ Here, the\n\n20 J.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nCourt stated that a State may not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States”.²⁵ This principle of law is customary in nature and applies to all States.\n\nIn other words, States are required under international law to take appropriate steps to protect the rights of other States from harmful acts.²⁶ This obligation applies not only to criminal acts harmful to other States, but also, for example, to activities that inflict serious damage, or have the potential to inflict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the territorial sovereignty of the target State.²⁷\n\nThere are generally two categories of cyber infrastructure for which a State is responsible: (i) any cyber infrastructure (governmental or not in nature) located on a State’s own territory; and (ii) cyber infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This requirement to not allow its infrastructure to be used to harm another is the duty of the State, irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State. In other words, a State is not excused because they did not generate the harm. When States have knowledge of the harmful acts, they have a duty to stop them.\n\nThis standard clearly applies when the State has actual knowledge of the acts in question. Knowledge is imputed to the State if State organs, such as its intelligence or law enforcement agencies, know of the harm emanating from its cyber infrastructure. For example, if State A operates a Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, that monitors networks and network traffic going into and out of State A, and the CERT becomes aware of malicious activity that is causing harm to State B, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that harm. Similarly, if State A receives credible information (perhaps from victim State B) that a harmful cyber activity is underway from its territory, State A is deemed to have knowledge of that cyber activity.\n\nHowever, there may be times when a State may not have actual knowledge but perhaps should have had knowledge, given the circumstances of the situation. It is unclear under international law whether States have the same duty with only constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge.\n\nIn the Corfu Channel case, the Court held Albania liable for the harm to England because the Court concluded that Albania “must have known” about the emplacement of the mines that caused the harm.²⁸ The “must have known” standard is clearly higher than a “should have known” standard and makes it harder to argue for something short of actual knowledge or information so clear that knowledge is almost cer-\n\n25 *Ibid.*, at p. 22.\n\n26 *Tehran Hostages* case, paras. 67–68.\n\n27 *Trail Smelter* arbitration (US v.

Albania), supra note 24.\n\n76",
    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\ntain.²⁹ Therefore, regardless of monitoring or other efforts, if the State does not know about the harm coming from its infrastructure, international law is not clear as to the responsibility of the State for harmful activities to other States. For example, if State A operates a CERT but that CERT does not detect the malicious activity emanating from its infrastructure, it is unclear if State A has failed in their duty.\n\nDespite the seemingly comprehensive nature of this obligation, international law also allows that some harmful acts must be tolerated in the spirit of good neighbourliness.³⁰ A State is only obligated to take reasonable measures to prevent or stop harmful activities. If the harm is slight and the requirements of remediation would be great, the victim State may be required to tolerate the harm, at least temporarily. To illustrate the point, consider this example. Assume State A knows that its infrastructure is being used to deface a government website in State B, but shutting down that server will cause serious disruption of emergency services to a large city within State A, it is likely unreasonable for State B to expect State A to shut down the server.\n\nThe duty of a State to control its cyber infrastructure is complicated by several factors. These include: 1) the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character; 2) the nature of data that transits over cyber infrastructure; 3) the non-directable nature of transit of cyber data over cyber infrastructure; and 4) the numerous actors that send data over cyber infrastructure over whom the State exercises little or no control. These factors deserve more detailed attention.\n\nThe nature of cyber acts must be considered in assessing the implementation of a State’s duty to control its infrastructure. Because an adverse or unlawful act may be sent instantaneously from within its territory over its cyber infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for a State to prevent such an act. For example, the first time a State may discover a cyber act initiating from its cyber infrastructure is when the victim State notifies it of the incident. Indeed, the nature of cyber acts have caused States to often respond to such activities reactively under criminal law, either prosecuting their own citizens under domestic law or seeking extradition of citizens from another State. Despite the difficulties with identifying harmful cyber activities, once a State has knowledge of the incident, it must take steps to control its cyber infrastructure.\n\nEven when monitoring is effective and potentially harmful, or unlawful cyber acts are discovered before their initiation, the compressed time and space characteristics of cyber harm may make it infeasible for a State to prevent injury to another State that comes from its cyber infrastructure. For example, State A may know that a harmful cyber operation is being prepared and will be launched from its territory against State B. However, because it has not identified the attack’s exact signature and timing, the only effective option may be to isolate the network that will be used in the attack from the internet, assuming the specific network is known. Doing so\n\n29 *Ibid.*\n30 *Brunnée, supra note 22.*\n\n77",
    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nwill often result in a ‘self-denial’ of service to at least a portion of internet users in State A. The nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to both States must be assessed to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness.³¹ The potential harm to State A must be reasonable in relation to the potential harm to be avoided in State B.\n\nThe nature of data and the method that the data uses to transit the internet also complicates the application of this rule. Because data is generally unreadable in transit and because it follows a generally undirectable path from sending point to receiving point, a State may be informed by the victim State that an harmful cyber activity is traversing its cyber infrastructure but not be immediately able to ascertain how to prevent the harm from continuing or have a reasonable method for stopping the harm. Once again, a standard of reasonableness would apply to this situation.³²\n\nThe nature of the actors who can use a State’s cyber infrastructure is also a complicating factor in a State controlling its cyber infrastructure, at least as a matter of enforcement and deterrence. The spectrum of non-State actors that conduct nefarious cyber activities include individuals, criminal organisations, and transnational interest groups.³³ If any of these nefarious activities amount to an armed attack, a State could potentially respond in self-defence. For actions by non-State actors not amounting to an armed attack, responses are far more limited.\n\nPart of States’ current methodology to deter the use of their infrastructure by non-State actors for activities that may adversely affect other States is to enforce criminal sanctions against violators. However, gaining jurisdiction³⁴ over non-citizens who may be remotely using cyber infrastructure within the State is problematic and implicates principles of extradition and dual criminality among others. This adds a layer of difficulty for a victim State intent on preventing or deterring transnational groups that are acting from multiple separate States and using cyber infrastructure to conduct activities that have adverse effects on third States. For example, assume State A’s government communications networks are degraded by a DDOS event. Forensic research finds that the DDOS came from thousands of computers spread across more than ten countries. State A must then either entice the ten countries from whose territory the cyber harm originated to investigate and prosecute, or it must seek extradition and then prosecute in State A.\n\n31 M. N.

    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nFor parties to the European Cybercrime Convention,³⁵ many of the procedural hurdles to accomplishing this are either removed or lessened, but any prosecution will still be long delayed and not result in any final action for several years. The value of this type of enforcement mechanism as a deterrent to others is limited at best. Additionally, just because State A has extradition treaties with the ten countries from where the cyber harm comes, does not mean that they are forced to extradite the perpetrators. There are still many complicating factors, both political and legal.³⁶\n\nIf a State whose infrastructure is being used to create harm or conduct unlawful acts fails to take appropriate steps to stop the harm, the victim-State may be entitled to respond to that violation of international law by resorting to lawful responses such as proportionate countermeasures or the use of force in self-defence.\n\nComplying with this obligation to ensure a State’s cyber infrastructure is not used to harm other States, seems to imply an affirmative responsibility to attempt to prevent such acts from occurring. The duty loses much of its utility in preventing threats to international peace and security if all it does is mandate a reaction and not place any affirmative duty on the State of prevention and monitoring.³⁷ It is to this question that this article will turn next.\n\n## 4. Duty to Monitor and Prevent\n\nIn order to fully comply with the duty to control its own cyber infrastructure, a State has an emerging duty to monitor cyber activities occurring within its territory or in situations under its exclusive governmental control in order to prevent or stop acts that adversely or unlawfully affect other States. The standard of care for monitoring and prevention of harmful cyber activities under international law is most likely due diligence.\n\nThis duty is also based on the principle of *sic utero tuo ut alienum non laedas*³⁸ and customary law established through cases such as the *Trail Smelter* arbitration,³⁹ the *Corfu Channel* case,⁴⁰ and the *Pulp Mills* case.⁴¹ Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights and Duties of States and the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities also provide persuasive authority that this principle is accepted as customary international law.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nan emerging principle of customary international law, it would become binding on all States, though it seems unlikely that such a rule has currently reached that status.\n\nThe fundamental rationale for this emerging duty is that a State cannot refuse to monitor in order to avoid “knowing” about cyber activities or to avoid responsibility to prevent harmful cyber activities occurring from within its territory or controlled infrastructure. In other words, State A cannot turn a blind eye to suspected or even potential cyber activities that may cause harm to State B in order to avoid the responsibility to control cyber infrastructure. As early as 1924, a League of Nations Commission of Jurists asked to resolve the Janina-Corfu affair, determined that “if the State has neglected to take all reasonable measures for the prevention of the crime”,[42] that State would be responsible for that harm. Similarly, in the aftermath of the occupation of the US Embassy in Iran, the ICJ held that Iran had failed to take “appropriate steps” to ensure the protection of the US consulate.[43]\n\nThe costs associated with monitoring and preventing cyber harm could be extensive and States may try to avoid those costs and maintain a merely responsive approach. To the extent that this emerging norm binds States, it would not allow such action. Rather, this duty would give States an affirmative responsibility to monitor and prevent.\n\nOne of the difficulties with this emerging duty is that States have different technological capabilities to monitor and prevent cyber activities. The technological capability of a State is a factor to be considered when applying this duty. For example, the standard of care for monitoring and preventing harmful or unlawful cyber activities will be applied more stringently to a technologically developed nation as opposed to an undeveloped nation.[44]\n\nIn assessing the current status under international law of the obligation to prevent acts that unlawfully or adversely affect other States, it is necessary to consider the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm.[45] The ILC's Draft Articles have not been accepted as a matter of treaty law by States but have been discussed approvingly in multiple international legal fora and quoted as customary international law in numerous situations, including discussions among the General Assembly.\n\nThe International Law Commission concluded in its sixth committee report to the General Assembly that there were four criteria inherent in the definition of transboundary harm: 1) activity in question must be human activity, 2) it must be within the territory or control of one State, 3) it must give rise or be capable of giving rise\n\n42 R.

    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nto harm, and 4) that harm must be to persons or things within another State.⁴⁶ Therefore, for cyber activities to rise to the level of transboundary harm, they would have to qualify under these criteria. This will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nCyber activities generally meet the requirement of “human activity” because all cyber operations, even if programmed to happen automatically, were initially established by a person, as were the protocols for initiation. There is no obvious reason why cyber activities would not meet this criterion.\n\nWith respect to transboundary harm, the ILC Draft Articles define transboundary harm as harm caused either in another State’s territory or “in other places under the jurisdiction or control of a State other than the State of origin”.⁴⁷ Some scholars have argued that cyberspace should be treated like the commons, therefore out of the sovereign territory of a State.⁴⁸ This argument is unconvincing with respect to this obligation. The hardware and software that compose the World Wide Web exist in physical space that is within some States’ sovereign territory. Even cyber operations from ships on the high seas are located on some ship that is flagged by a certain State and over which that certain State exercises almost exclusive jurisdiction. While it is theoretically possible to envision a set of facts where cyber harm would emanate from an area outside sovereign jurisdiction, the vast majority of cyber incidents in the past and the foreseeable future will be governed by the principles of sovereignty and meet the second criterion.\n\nUnder this rule, cyber harm must affect other States. Transboundary harm is manifested by transboundary physical consequences that result in significant harm to another State’s rights.⁴⁹ While ‘significant’ is not defined in the Draft Articles, the commentary indicates that it is “something more than ‘detectable’ but need not be at the level of ‘serious’ or ‘substantial’”.⁵⁰ Therefore, the harm must lead to a detrimental effect on persons, property, or the environment that may be measured by factual and objective standards.⁵¹\n\n46 D.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nSimilarly, the harm must be “transboundary”. Cyber harms that have purely domestic affects will not invoke this duty. For example, a State has not international legal obligation under this rule to prevent cyber harm that comes from within its own sovereign territory and only has effects in its own sovereign territory. However, international law may be implicated in such circumstances under different rules, such as obligations under human rights.\n\nAs will be discussed later, if a State knows transboundary harm will occur or that there is a risk thereof, it has an obligation to notify and cooperate with the potential victim State. The State of origin is required to consult on preventive or remedial measures after equitably balancing the interest of both States.⁵² The consultation must be done in good faith. The consultation requirement is an on-going obligation and does not cease after an initial consultation.\n\nAnother important consideration of this emerging duty is that the obligation to monitor and prevent harm to another State is one of conduct rather than result.⁵³ Therefore, a State is required “to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost”⁵⁴ to prevent or minimise harm to another State. In cases where the State is unable to prevent the harm, State responsibility may accrue, but this duty will not necessarily have been violated. For example, if cyber harm is emanating from within the borders of State A against targets in State B, and State A acts in accordance with this rule to monitor and prevent the harm, State A will have met its duty under international law, even though it still may be liable for damages under the rules of State responsibility.⁵⁵\n\nIn applying this emerging obligation, States cannot be expected to prevent every harm. As discussed above, the principle of *sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas* assumes that victim States must accept some harm under the doctrine of good neighbourliness.⁵⁶ Therefore, a State is not required to monitor cyber activities with the expectation that it can prevent every harm. Further complicating the analysis, it is unclear what level of harm is an amount necessary to trigger this rule. However, it seems that a standard of reasonableness would apply to these situations.⁵⁷\n\nTo the extent that there is a standard for the State’s duty to monitor and prevent unlawful or harmful activities, it is one of due diligence. As a standard for a State’s duty to prevent transboundary harm, due diligence has a long history and applies to all subjects of international law.⁵⁸ While it was not included as a standard for\n\n⁵² *Ibid.*, Articles 9, 10.\n\n⁵³ *ITLOS Advisory Opinion* (2011), para. 110.\n\n⁵⁴ *Ibid.*\n\n⁵⁵ Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001, Ch.

    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nState responsibility,⁵⁹ the principle was a significant concern in the negotiations.⁶⁰ Further, it continues to guide many areas of international transboundary harm, with particular relevance to international environmental law⁶¹ and other areas that deal with physical transboundary harm.⁶²\n\nDue diligence does not have a single definition in international law, but it has been used to mean that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance.⁶³ Due diligence requires “reasonable efforts by a State to inform itself of factual and legal components that relate foreseeably to a contemplated procedure, and to take appropriate measures, in timely fashion, to address them”.⁶⁴ The standard of due diligence is that which is “generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.⁶⁵ In the context of cyber activities, due diligence requires States to 1) establish specific institutional capacity to be able to exercise due diligence, and 2) co-operate in cases of transboundary harm.⁶⁶\n\nThe duty to monitor and prevent is an ongoing duty. Therefore, States must continuously exercise due diligence and continuously consult with potential victim States in order to prevent transboundary harm from cyber activities.⁶⁷\n\nAs with this emerging norm as a whole, the standard of due diligence does not require the achievement of any specific result, but rather that a State takes necessary\n\n59 Commentary to Article 2 of the International Law Commission, Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, G.A.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nsteps towards achieving that result.⁶⁸ In other words, due diligence requires a State’s conduct to reach a minimum standard of what a “reasonable” or “good” government would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.⁶⁹\n\nThis was confirmed in an advisory opinion by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea where the Tribunal noted that “[t]he sponsoring State’s obligation ‘to ensure’ is not an obligation to achieve ... Rather, it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost, to obtain this result to utilize the current technology in international law ... An obligation of ‘conduct’ and not ‘of result’, and as an obligation of ‘due diligence’.”⁷⁰ In the context of cyber activities, exercising due diligence may not prevent cyber harm or unlawful activities, but a State has the legal obligation to “deploy adequate [cyber] means” to monitor potentially harmful cyber activities and prevent the harm from reaching another State.\n\nThe impact of the technological capability of a State mentioned above with respect to this duty also applies to the standard of due diligence.⁷¹ An advanced State may be required to do more by way of due diligence than a State with lesser technological capability.⁷² It will also adjust over time, requiring a State to “keep abreast to technological changes and scientific developments”.⁷³ For example, State A will not be relieved of its due diligence responsibility to monitor and prevent if it simply chooses to not create a government entity to do so out of convenience for the State. Similarly, a State cannot set up an initial cyber monitoring capability and then neglect to update that capability. On the other hand, if a State objectively does not have the financial means to establish or maintain adequate cyber monitoring services (or contract for such services), it may be that the State will have a decreased standard of care in a given situation.\n\nThe due diligence standard also applies to State sponsored commercial activities. International law provides that when a State sponsors a commercial activity, and when that activity has the potential of producing transboundary harm, the sponsoring State must exercise due diligence in preventing such harm.⁷⁴ For example, if a State owns and operates an oil refinery, it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the refinery does not cause transboundary harm. In the cyber context, if a State owns\n\n68 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n69 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n70 ITLOS’s Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area; UNCLOS, Article 139.\n71 Nicaragua judgment, supra note 7, para. 157.\n72 Koivurova, supra note 49.\n73 Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, at p. 394.\n74 International Law Commission Commentary to Article 3 of the Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm; ITLOS’ Advisory Opinion on Responsibility and Obligations of State’s Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area.",
    "State Obligations in Cyber Operations\n\nand operates servers or networks, it must exercise due diligence to make sure those servers and networks do not cause or are not used to cause transboundary harm.\n\nThe principle of due diligence applies not only to State actions, but also to the actions of non-State actors, including its own citizens. “International law imposes the duty upon every state to exercise due diligence to prevent its own subjects, and such foreign subjects as live within its territory, from committing injurious acts against other states.”75 This same notion is found in the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm which confirms that States have an obligation to apply due diligence to prevent transboundary harm that originates from non-State actors within their territory or over government controlled infrastructure.76 This may require the government to monitor some civilian internet traffic or activity, at least as required to assess potential adverse or unlawful activity. Of course, any such monitoring must comply with both domestic law and international human rights norms.\n\nOn the issue of monitoring private networks, in a State where the majority of internet infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies, the State will have to take some steps to ensure that infrastructure is also properly monitored in order to prevent transboundary harm. It may do this by monitoring the private networks and infrastructure, passing and enforcing laws that require the private companies to monitor and prevent, or some other methods that meet the standard of care of due diligence. As an illustration of this principle, Annex III of UNCLOS provides that “[a] sponsoring state shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that state has adopted laws and regulations ... reasonably appropriate for securing compliance by persons under its jurisdiction”.77\n\nThis same duty of due diligence to monitor networks and prevent transboundary harm applies not only to legitimate private actors but also to criminal elements such as rioters, even though no State responsibility may attach to their actions.78 For example, assume State A discovers that a criminal organisation within its territory is planning harmful cyber activity on a corporation in State B. State A must still exercise due diligence to prevent such activity. The standard to be met by the requirement to exercise due diligence varies with the circumstances, including the target of the harmful activity. Therefore, a possible unlawful cyber act by one private individual against another private individual in another country would require a lesser form of due diligence than a similar event against a significant State asset.79\n\nIn some circumstances, a State may meet its general due diligence requirement by making and enforcing laws that punish wrongdoers and establish the principle of\n\n75 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, p. 549.\n76 Koivurova, supra note 49; Commentary to UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.\n77 UNCLOS Article 4, para. 4.\n78 Jennings and Watts, supra note 42, pp. 550–551.\n79 Ibid., p. 549\n\n85",

However, the principles of transboundary harm are clearly gaining customary status, and there is no reason why they would not implicate cyber activities. Therefore, States should be aware of the progression of the law in this area and take action accordingly.\n\n# 5. Due Regard\n\nIn addition to the due diligence a State must exercise with respect to its own cyber activities they might cause, there is an emerging norm that a State must also act with due regard for the rights of other States in its cyber activities.\n\nThis emerging obligation has its origins in numerous treaties including the 1958 High Seas Convention, $^{81}$  the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, $^{82}$  and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, $^{83}$  as well as decisions of the International Court of Justice. $^{84}$  The requirement to act with due regard toward the rights of other States is also specifically confirmed with respect to natural resources $^{85}$  and the environment, $^{86}$  including during times of armed conflict. $^{87}$  To the extent that the principle of due\n\n80 Ibid., p. 509.\n81 1958 High Seas Convention.\n82 UNCLOS, Articles 27(4), 39(3)(a), 56(2) 58(3), 60(3), 66(3)(a), 79(5), 87(2), 142(1) 148, 161(4), 162(2)(d), 163(2), 167(2), 234, 267; appendix II, Article 2(1); appendix IV, Articles 51(1)-(2).\n83 Outer Space Treaty, Article IX.\n84 Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project, (Hungary/Slovakia), 1997 I.C.J. 7 (25 Sept. 1997) (Judgment).\n85 General Assembly Resolution 1803 on Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, GA Res. 1803 (XVII) / 17 UN GAOR Supp. (No.17) at 15 / UN Doc.

There is no evidence that it would apply as a matter of law to non-State actors.\n\nThere is no generally accepted definition of the term due regard. However, one commentator has defined it as an obligation to ensure that the exercise of one State's rights do not cause undue harm to another State's exercise of their rights.⁸⁸ With respect to the high seas, due regard is defined as the obligation to “be aware of and consider the interests of other States in using the high seas, and to refrain from activities that interfere with the exercise by other States of the freedom of the high seas”.⁸⁹ This usage conforms to the term’s general application in other circumstances. Due regard is thought to have two components: 1) an awareness and consideration of either State interests or other factors, and 2) a balancing of those interests and factors when making a decision.⁹⁰\n\nThere is some discussion as to whether this duty applies only to the commons such as the environment and the high seas because most references to due regard involve those situations. However, there are sufficient other agreed applications of the due regard standard to “non-commons” State interests that it seems clear that the obligation to exercise due regard is gaining broader application. For example, when laying submarine cables and pipelines, States must do so with due regard for existing pipelines.⁹¹ Additionally, when making arrests in the territorial sea, the arresting State must show due regard for the other States’ navigational interests.⁹² States must exercise due regard to the rights of other States when exercising their own rights in their exclusive economic zone, and other States must show the same due regard with respect to the rights of the coastal State.⁹³ Aircraft transiting straits must operate with due regard to the safety of navigation.⁹⁴ Numerous similar references illustrate that though many of the due regard obligations must be respected with geographic areas that correspond to the commons, that is certainly not exclusively so and the focus is not the geographic location, but the other State’s interests that might be affected.\n\nA general due regard obligation would require States to exercise due regard for the rights of other States in all of their cyber activities. In other words, when a State takes action regarding cyber activities or cyber incidents, it would need to do so with\n\nManual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, § 35.\n\n88 C.

For example, when State A wants to establish a cyber security system to protect its infrastructure, it must do so with due regard for the impacts of that system on the rights of other States. So, if the security system would have the effect of slowing or deleting general international cyber traffic, State A may have to find an alternative system or find ways to mitigate the effect on other States.\n\nWith respect to what considerations would be part of the analysis, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) commentary states that due regard “implies that all the relevant circumstances are to be taken into consideration”.⁹⁵ This means that when a State exercises due regard, it should take an expansive view of the potential impacts of its actions on the rights of other States. In the cyber context, if State A chooses to shut down servers within its territory as a security measure and knows that this shutdown will impact State B’s internet traffic, State A must exercise due regard for State B when taking their action, including considerations such as State B’s ability to adapt to State A’s actions and State B’s technical capabilities.\n\nThere is no general obligation for a State to exercise due regard with respect to cyber operations that affect only non-State actors. However, special regimes such as the law of armed conflict may have obligations that apply more broadly. Additionally, if State A takes actions that affect a non-State actor in State B, this duty would still apply at least as to State B. In other words, any impacts on State B caused by State A’s actions against the non-State actor in State B would be governed by the duty to act with due regard.\n\nThough the explicit international law with respect to the due regard obligation appears mostly in international environmental and resource law, there are many examples of a more general application and few, if any, examples of States decrying the principle. There are already claims that this principle has, in fact, reached the level of a general principle of customary international law. However, considering all the evidence, this claim seems premature.\n\n## 6. Precautionary Principle\n\nAnother emerging international law principle that has been applied to cyber operations is the precautionary principle.⁹⁶ While some expansion of the application of this norm is certainly taking place, the current law only provides that a State is obliged to apply the precautionary principle with respect to cyber operations that affect the environment.\n\nThis obligation which applies the precautionary principle or approach to cyber activities has its origins in prohibitions against transboundary harm, with particular application to the environment. The modern formulation of the principle is found in\n\n⁹⁵ 4 UNCLOS Commentary, para. 267.3(b).\n⁹⁶ Crawford, supra note 18, p. 357; Schröder, supra note 86.\n\n88",

It is accepted as customary international law with respect to the environment and is binding on all nations with respect to that discreet area of the law.\n\nLike due regard, the precautionary principle does not have an agreed upon definition. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration is the most referenced source of the definition and it states: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”\n\nAnother definition that was formulated in 1988 by a number of scientists, lawyers, policy makers and environmentalists has become known as the “Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle”. It states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures\n\n97 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Stockholm, June 1972.\n98 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Rio de Janiero, June 1992.\n99 World Charter for Nature 1982; Montreal Protocol 1987; Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development in ECE Region 1990; Ministerial Declaration of 3rd International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea; Bamako Convention 1991; 1992 UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes; Rio Declaration 1992; UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992; Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 1993; UN Fish Stocks Agreement 1995; Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; and Stockholm Convention 2000.\n100 See Nuclear Tests case, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion where he states the precautionary principle is an emerging norm of customary international law.\n101 See Schöder, supra note 86, paras. 119–120.\n102 Nuclear Test cases 1995, Judge Weeramantry’s dissenting opinion, para. 21.\n103 EC-Hormones Case (EU v.

    "Eric Talbot Jensen\n\nshould be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically\".105\n\nAs a general statement, the precautionary principle involves the process by which policymakers apply science, technology and economics together in order to protect the environment.106 \"Recourse to the precautionary principle presupposes that potentially dangerous effects deriving from a phenomenon, product or process have been identified, and that scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty.\"107\n\nThe precautionary principle serves to prevent States from taking unjustified risks that may damage the environment, or on a broader scale, produce transboundary harm. The use of the precautionary principle is \"justified when there is no clear evidence about a particular risk scenario, when the risk itself is uncertain, or until the risk is disproved\".108 In the face of such risks, States must take measures based on the best scientific evidence available. According to the European Union, the measure to be taken should be:\n\nproportional to the chosen level of protection; non-discriminatory in their application; consistent with similar measures already taken; based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action (including, where appropriate and feasible, an economic cost/benefit analysis); subject to review, in the light of new scientific data, and capable of assigning responsibility for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment.109\n\nStates have an obligation to apply the precautionary principle to their cyber operations which may affect the environment. Additionally, there is an increasing number of sources that argue that the precautionary principle is an emerging principle of customary international law that applies to the acts of States more generally.110 The European Commission stated that though the European Union Treaty makes reference to the precautionary principle only with respect to the environment,111 \"in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary objective scientific evaluation, indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the poten\n\n105 ‘Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle’, Science &amp; Environmental Health Network, 26 January 1988, <www.sehn.org wing.html=\"\">, visited on 22 March 2014.\n106 Crawford, supra note 18, p.358.\n107 Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n108 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n109 ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 4 (2 February 2000).\n110 Crawford, supra note 18, p. 358.\n111 EC Treaty, Article 174.</www.sehn.org>",

Cyber-attacks and other actions during armed conflict are already subject to the rules on precautions in attack, which include many similar considerations as those included in the precautionary principle. But the application of the precautionary principle to cyber activities more generally would include consideration of factors such as those enunciated by the EU Commission mentioned above. As new cyber tools and techniques are developed, calls for applying the precautionary approach to their use will likely continue.\n\n## 7. International Cooperation\n\nFinally, a State has an obligation to cooperate with a victim State in the event of adverse or unlawful cyber effects from cyber infrastructure located in its territory, or under its exclusive governmental control, that may affect international peace and security. A more general duty to cooperate in response to events that do not threaten international peace and security is emerging, but does not yet have the status of customary international law.\n\nThis obligation is based on UN Charter, Articles 1 and 33.¹¹³ The duty to cooperate has also been affirmed in the ICJ’s *Pulp Mills* case,¹¹⁴ and also has a customary international law basis as pronounced in the UN General Assembly’s Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations¹¹⁵ and other documents such as the UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities.¹¹⁶\n\nFor the purposes of understanding this legal obligation, cooperation is the “voluntary co-ordinated action of two or more States which takes place under a legal regime and serves a specific objective”.¹¹⁷\n\nIn addition to those circumstances mentioned above where the maintenance of international peace and security is at risk,¹¹⁸ the duty to cooperate also applies to the solving of international problems of economic, social, cultural or humanitar-\n\n¹¹² ‘Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle’, COM(2000)1, at 3 (2 February 2000).\n\n¹¹³ UN Charter, Articles 1, 33.\n\n¹¹⁴ *Pulp Mills* case, *supra* note 41, p. 56.\n\n¹¹⁵ UN GA Declaration on Friendly Relations.\n\n¹¹⁶ UN ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, Article 7.\n\n¹¹⁷ R.

Article 23 requires that “[t]he Parties shall co-operate with each other”¹²³ and provide mutual assistance, particularly with respect to investigations of cyber incidents.¹²⁴ Therefore, for parties to the Convention, the obligation to cooperate is based on the Convention and different that for non-parties.\n\nFor all others, this duty is limited to instances where cyber activities threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. States may become involved in such cyber activities either as host to or victim of cyber activities. In either case, the State has a responsibility to cooperate in resolving the incident peacefully.\n\nIn addition to requirements on the scope of the duty, the law only requires States to cooperate when the adverse or unlawful cyber incident originates from infrastructure within the territory or under its exclusive governmental control or transits the cyber infrastructure in the State’s territory or under its exclusive government control. Both conditions must be met for the duty to be applicable.\n\nNo specific standard for the level of cooperation is clearly agreed upon, but the general consensus is that States must exercise good faith when fulfilling this duty.¹²⁵\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nThe law on State obligations with respect to cyber activities is likely to continue to evolve as more and more State practice becomes available. Currently, few obligations have risen to the level of binding as a matter of law. These would certainly include the obligation to resolve certain disputes peacefully as well as the obligation for a State to not let its infrastructure be knowingly uses for activities that will harm another State. The duty to exercise due diligence in monitoring networks and preventing harm seems like a necessary measure to implement that obligation.\n\nThe exact boundaries of other obligations such as exercising due regard for the rights of other States, the application of the precautionary principle, and the duty to cooperate are still developing. The passage of time and the actions of States will undoubtedly influence that development.\n\n119 UN Charter, Article 1(3).\n120 Antarctica Treaty, Articles 2, 3.\n121 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, 27 Jan. 1967, 18 U.S.T. 2410, T.I.A.S.
