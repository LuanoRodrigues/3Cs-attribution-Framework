Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n131\n## 5.2 Different Levels of Publicity of Unacknowledged Acts\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nto the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars.¹³ In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN.¹⁴ The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html. See also, Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, declining to comment: ‘There is nothing I can say about this subject’ in Ulf Laessing and Khalid Abdelaziz, ‘Sudan Blames Israeli Air Strike Hit for Munitions Plant Blasts’, Reuters UK, 24 October 2012, available at http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-planes-idUSBRE89N0WU20121024.\n¹⁸ Laessing and Abdelaziz, ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nThe attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session.¹⁹ The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence.²⁰ The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States,²¹ but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²²\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n²⁴ Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n137\nIn yet other situations, states may choose not to react to covert operations even where they are reported and debated by other actors. The next section, therefore, turns to the question of in what ways unacknowledged conduct may affect the law when states and international governmental organisations remain silent.\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation.²⁵ There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n²⁵ For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack.²⁶ At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development.²⁷ The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n²⁶ Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n²⁷ Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n139\nThe difficulty of considering unacknowledged acts as claims becomes evident through a closer look the US drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and 2010.²⁸ Would it, for example, be possible to identify any claims made by the United States through its drone strikes before the Obama administration started providing legal justifications for its drone strikes in March 2010? While the potential effects of the later, quasi-covert version of the drone programs were discussed in the previous chapter, what is considered here is the effect of the earlier phases of the drone programs on the development of international law. It is important to remember that the programs lasted for several years, and grew to quite large dimensions before the United States started to provide legal justifications for them. Although the first drone strike outside of an area of active hostilities took place in Yemen in 2002, and the first drone strike in Pakistan was conducted in 2004, it took until 2010 for the United States to begin to provide legal justifications for the strikes. Between 2004 and March 2010, there were over 100 drone attacks in Pakistan alone, killing hundreds of people, many of them civilian.²⁹\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.³⁰\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law.³¹ An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n²⁸ Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n²⁹ See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n³⁰ This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n³¹ See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them.³² On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.³³\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons.³⁴ First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law.³⁵ If true, and it is argued here that it\n³² See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n³³ See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n³⁴ It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n³⁵ Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nscholarly works.³⁶ Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states.³⁷ Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.³⁸\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks.³⁹ At the same time, in cases where\n³⁶ See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n³⁷ Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf?

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries.⁴⁴ There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks.⁴⁵ Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states.⁴⁶ The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.⁴⁷\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008,⁴⁸ there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’.⁴⁹ One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.⁵⁰ When prompted by a reporter,\n⁴⁴ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n⁴⁵ Ibid.\n⁴⁶ ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n⁴⁷ Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n⁴⁸ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n⁴⁹ In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force,⁵² Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks.⁵³ The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet.⁵⁴ Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months.⁵⁵ Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.⁵⁶\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n⁵¹ ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n⁵² See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers.⁵⁷ However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’.⁵⁸ While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities.⁵⁹ Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.⁶⁰\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.⁶¹ In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was\n2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n⁵⁷ Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged . . .

The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad-\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n⁶⁴ 2005 World Summit Outcome, GA Res 60/1, UN Doc A/RES/60/1 (24 October 2005) [79].

See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nitionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n66 Duncan B Hollis, ‘Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations’ (2007) 11 Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review 1023, 1041.

Another way of addressing the shortcomings of too strong a focus on destruction rejects the existence of a clear line between instrument based and effect based approaches and instead suggests determining the use of force by the instrument, while determining the instrument based on its effects. See Roscini, n 36, arguing that: ‘weapons are identified by their effects . . . armed force . . . could be defined as the form of intervention . . . that involves the use of instruments (weapons) capable of producing violent consequences’: at 50. Roscini notably argues this with reference to the ICJ’s interpretation of support of armed groups as force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n72 See discussion in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.\n73 The definition of a cyberattack as force is complicated by the lack of a common agreement as to what constitute NCI. Indeed the UN General Assembly has stressed that this is something to be determined independently by states, see, e.g., Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures, GA Res 58/99, UN Doc A/RES/58/199 (30 January 2004). A helpful overview of state practice by Roscini, n 36, 55–60, shows that it is, however, possible to point out some commonalities between states: it is clear that NCI is focused on national security, and that this includes security on the societal, governmental, and individual level, such as ‘banking and finance, government, communications, emergency and rescue services, public health, transportation, food and water supply and energy’: at 58.\n74 For different views on this compare Roscini, n 36 and Harrison Dinniss, n 8, with the former accepting such practice as relevant and the latter significantly downplaying the value of verbal statements not produced in response to a public physical act.\n75 ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, n 51.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n76 See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\n77 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1.\n78 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 333–7.\n79 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1, 1–11.\n80 See, e.g., Yaroslav Radziwill, Cyber-Attacks and the Exploitable Imperfection of International Law (Brill Nijhoff, 2015) 8–9; Kristen E Eichensehr, ‘Book Review: Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare’ (2014) 108 American Journal of International Law 585, 585.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nthe attacks and why.⁸¹ From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force,⁸² Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’.⁸³ Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force.⁸⁴ For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8.

The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility\n⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred.

The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶\n⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nStill, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nhas taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression $^{103}$ when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. $^{104}$ The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. $^{105}$ In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. $^{106}$ Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. $^{107}$ This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. $^{108}$\nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. $^{109}$ That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal\n$^{103}$ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n$^{104}$ Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n$^{105}$ Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n$^{106}$ Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139.

Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary,¹¹³ the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’,¹¹⁴ and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed,¹¹⁵ strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n¹¹³ See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated.¹¹⁷ Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack.¹¹⁸ This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.¹¹⁹\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n¹¹⁶ See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force.¹²⁰ This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'.¹²¹ The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference',¹²² but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill.¹²³ It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n¹²¹ Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n¹²² Ibid.\n¹²³ Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks.¹²⁴ As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future.¹²⁵ As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n¹²⁴ Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n¹²⁵ See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.5 CONCLUSION\nas a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
  "flat_text": "## 5.1 Introduction\nUnacknowledged operations can differ significantly in their level of public knowledge and debate, ranging from acts shrouded in secrecy to acts that are widely reported and debated by other states, IGOs, international legal scholars, and NGOs.\nTechnological developments creating the possibility for devastating cyberattacks make urgent a discussion on the very understanding of what constitutes force, and in what ways – and against whom – states may respond to them. Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.\n See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state, and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law. This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law, such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known, even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states. That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force. This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23. A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled. Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nto the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars. In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN. The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’. Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’. Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’. Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n Ibid.\n Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html. See also, Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, declining to comment: ‘There is nothing I can say about this subject’ in Ulf Laessing and Khalid Abdelaziz, ‘Sudan Blames Israeli Air Strike Hit for Munitions Plant Blasts’, Reuters UK, 24 October 2012, available at http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-planes-idUSBRE89N0WU20121024.\n Laessing and Abdelaziz, ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nThe attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session. The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence. The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States, but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n Ibid.\n Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes. However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation. There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack. At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development. The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law. An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them. On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law. If true, and it is argued here that it\n See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nscholarly works. Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states. Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks. At the same time, in cases where\n See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice’ (2018) 112 *American Journal of International Law* 583, highlighting that ‘[a]t the same time, the interest shown recently by multiple states in collectively attributing international responsibility for global cyberoperations, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, may reflect a conscious decision on their part to invoke an international law framework, with a view to facilitating a coordinated overt response, which could enjoy broad international legitimacy’ and that this can be ‘a critical juncture for the development of international law regulating cyberoperations in which national security considerations militating in favor of maintaining operational latitude through silence and ambiguity may be gradually giving way to the communicative and norm-consolidation imperatives of collective action and applying the pressures of public diplomacy’: at 649.\n These attacks are chosen due to their visibility in the legal debates around the use of force and self-defence.\n As Matthew Waxman has argued:\nresponses and reactions to cyber attacks will probably involve high levels of government secrecy. The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret. Defenders too, though, may be reluctant to disclose details or even the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\ncyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.\nEven though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously. While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.\n## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran\nDespite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries. There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks. Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states. The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008, there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’. One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. When prompted by a reporter,\n Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n Ibid.\n ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force, Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks. The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet. Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months. Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n Ibid.\n Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers. However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’. While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities. Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010. In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was\n2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged . . . Investigations show that some private software of the power plant’s employees have been contaminated’.

Speculation has suggested that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attacks, something that has been denied by the United States, whereas Israel has refrained from commenting on its responsibility.\n## 5.3.2 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Force’\nThat states consider cyberattacks to fall within the rules of the UN Charter was (implicitly) confirmed by states in the World Summit Outcome in 2005, and can further be seen in numerous statements and documents. However, the problem remains regarding how to decide whether or not a cyberattack can be considered as ‘force’. The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad-\n Ibid.\n See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n\n See, e.g., *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc. A/71/172 (19 July 2016) 8 (submission by Cuba), 20 (submission by Spain), 24 (submission by the United Kingdom); *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc. A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nitionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nthe attacks and why. From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force, Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’. Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force. For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362. See also Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nby the non-state actor have been so directed and controlled by the supporting state as to be attributable to that state. The second is to use the definition of ‘indirect aggression’ as stated in Article 3(g) of the UN General Assembly’s 1974 Definition of Aggression. This is not the place to engage in a substantive discussion of which test is more appropriate, indeed this has been done elsewhere. Rather, the discussion to come aims to shed light on the complications on establishing responsibility in situations where the relevant conduct, or parts thereof, is unacknowledged.\nStarting first with attributability, there are two established tests for assessing whether the acts of a non-state group are attributable to a state. The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua and again in the Genocide Case, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic. Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies. The responsibility\n See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that\n[w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nalso includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’. With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility. That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence. First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n See Section 5.3.4.4.\n An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nStill, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state. In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’. Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes, has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence. However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n Ibid.\n Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nhas taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression $^{103}$ when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. $^{104}$ The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated.

Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary, the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’, and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed, strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated. Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack. This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76]. See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 7–8 [3]–[4].\n See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 10 [5]; Alston, n 24, 14 [43].

Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force. This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'. The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference', but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill. It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n Ibid.\n Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks. As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future. As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575.

At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

    "## 5.1 Introduction": "Unacknowledged operations can differ significantly in their level of public knowledge and debate, ranging from acts shrouded in secrecy to acts that are widely reported and debated by other states, IGOs, international legal scholars, and NGOs.\nTechnological developments creating the possibility for devastating cyberattacks make urgent a discussion on the very understanding of what constitutes force, and in what ways – and against whom – states may respond to them. Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS ## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States While it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷ In cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents... have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸ However, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to ⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY the initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰ As discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s) ¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis.

Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸ (online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html.

It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²² In summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS In relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n²⁴ Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY",
    "## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent": "Not all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation.²⁵ There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.",
    "## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts": "The question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n²⁵ For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack.²⁶ At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development.²⁷ The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n²⁶ Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n²⁷ Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made?

Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.³⁰ As discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law.³¹ An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the ²⁸ Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n²⁹ See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n³⁰ This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n³¹ See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS acts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them.³² On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.³³ Turning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons.³⁴ First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law.³⁵ If true, and it is argued here that it ³² See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n³³ See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n³⁴ It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n³⁵ Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS is, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.",
    "## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules The second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.": "While a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.",
    "## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks The increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous [i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.": "https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS scholarly works.³⁶ Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states.³⁷ Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.³⁸ Despite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks.³⁹ At the same time, in cases where ³⁶ See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n³⁷ Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice’ (2018) 112 *American Journal of International Law* 583, highlighting that ‘[a]t the same time, the interest shown recently by multiple states in collectively attributing international responsibility for global cyberoperations, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, may reflect a conscious decision on their part to invoke an international law framework, with a view to facilitating a coordinated overt response, which could enjoy broad international legitimacy’ and that this can be ‘a critical juncture for the development of international law regulating cyberoperations in which national security considerations militating in favor of maintaining operational latitude through silence and ambiguity may be gradually giving way to the communicative and norm-consolidation imperatives of collective action and applying the pressures of public diplomacy’: at 649.\n³⁸ These attacks are chosen due to their visibility in the legal debates around the use of force and self-defence.\n³⁹ As Matthew Waxman has argued: responses and reactions to cyber attacks will probably involve high levels of government secrecy. The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret. Defenders too, though, may be reluctant to disclose details or even the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS cyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.⁴⁰ Even though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously.⁴¹ While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.⁴² ## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran Despite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*.⁴³ Although states have been very existence of cyber attacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.\nMatthew C Waxman, ‘Self-Defensive Force against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 109, 119.\n⁴⁰ The ‘publicly known’ aspect of this is of importance as states would rarely wish to acknowledge weaknesses in their cyber defence.\n⁴¹ For example, NATO has held numerous discussions about cyber security, and its members have stated readiness to pledge mutual defence in response to a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, which illustrates further the importance of finding a definition for such attacks.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries.⁴⁴ There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks.⁴⁵ Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states.⁴⁶ The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.⁴⁷ Although sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008,⁴⁸ there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’.⁴⁹ One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.⁵⁰ When prompted by a reporter, ⁴⁴ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n⁴⁵ Ibid.\n⁴⁶ ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n⁴⁷ Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n⁴⁸ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n⁴⁹ In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force,⁵² Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks.⁵³ The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet.⁵⁴ Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months.⁵⁵ Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.⁵⁶ [t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n⁵¹ ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n⁵² See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS There are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers.⁵⁷ However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’.⁵⁸ While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities.⁵⁹ Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.⁶⁰ The Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.⁶¹ In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was 2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n⁵⁷ Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged... Investigations show that some private software of the power plant’s employees have been contaminated’.

The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad- ⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n⁶⁴ 2005 World Summit Outcome, GA Res 60/1, UN Doc A/RES/60/1 (24 October 2005) [79].

A/71/172 (19 July 2016) 8 (submission by Cuba), 20 (submission by Spain), 24 (submission by the United Kingdom); *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc. A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS itionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS As discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS discussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76 The most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80 In addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS the attacks and why.⁸¹ From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force,⁸² Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’.⁸³ Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force.⁸⁴ For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.",
    "## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks One of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts ⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.": "⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362.

The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility ⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n⁸⁸ See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that [w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n⁸⁹ Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n⁹⁰ Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n⁹¹ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS also includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’.⁹² With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴ The issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶ ⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS Still, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹ ## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence Cyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹ ## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’ The relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and ⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS has taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.",
    "## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality As discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum.": "In relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139. Though see Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defence (Cambridge University Press, 5th ed., 2011), suggesting that the concept of an armed attack is narrower than aggression as 'aggression in its generic meaning could potentially be stretched to include mere threats': at 197.\n Dinstein, ibid. This view is also supported by the ICJ. See, e.g., Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146].\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.5.4.2.\n Garwood-Gowers, n 101; Marty Lederman, 'Question on 2007 Strike against Syria and Anticipatory Self-Defense' on opinio juris (6 April 2012), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2012/04/06/question-on-2007-strike-against-syria-and-anticipatory-self-defense.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS understanding of imminence, or a setting aside of the imminence requirement altogether with regard to the right to self-defence, at least against nuclear threats, is, however, not convincing. Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^ Israel is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks ^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS against Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.",
    "## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity Cyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary,¹¹³ the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.": "The necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’,¹¹⁴ and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed,¹¹⁵ strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n¹¹³ See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated.¹¹⁷ Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack.¹¹⁸ This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.¹¹⁹ The difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality ¹¹⁶ See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

    "## 5.4 Cyberattacks and the Dynamic Interpretation of Jus ad Bellum It is clear that the cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran have had great influence on debates around the application of the UN Charter to cyberattacks. Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force.¹²⁰ This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'.¹²¹ The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference',¹²² but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill.¹²³ It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where ¹²⁰ See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.": "¹²¹ Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583 ¹²² Ibid.\n¹²³ Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere,\"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on\"Practice\",\"Growth\", and\"Dissemination\"(2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS reactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks.¹²⁴ As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future.¹²⁵ As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.",
    "## 5.5 Conclusion As demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve ¹²⁴ Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.": "¹²⁵ See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.5 CONCLUSION as a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.\n See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state, and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law. This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law, such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known, even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states. That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force. This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23. A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled. Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nto the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars. In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN. The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’. Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’. Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’. Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n Ibid.\n Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html.

The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence. The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States, but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n Ibid.\n Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes. However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation. There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack. At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development. The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law. An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them. On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law. If true, and it is argued here that it\n See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nscholarly works. Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states. Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks. At the same time, in cases where\n See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice’ (2018) 112 *American Journal of International Law* 583, highlighting that ‘[a]t the same time, the interest shown recently by multiple states in collectively attributing international responsibility for global cyberoperations, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, may reflect a conscious decision on their part to invoke an international law framework, with a view to facilitating a coordinated overt response, which could enjoy broad international legitimacy’ and that this can be ‘a critical juncture for the development of international law regulating cyberoperations in which national security considerations militating in favor of maintaining operational latitude through silence and ambiguity may be gradually giving way to the communicative and norm-consolidation imperatives of collective action and applying the pressures of public diplomacy’: at 649.\n These attacks are chosen due to their visibility in the legal debates around the use of force and self-defence.\n As Matthew Waxman has argued:\nresponses and reactions to cyber attacks will probably involve high levels of government secrecy. The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret. Defenders too, though, may be reluctant to disclose details or even the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\ncyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.\nEven though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously. While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.\n## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran\nDespite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*. Although states have been\nvery existence of cyber attacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.\nMatthew C Waxman, ‘Self-Defensive Force against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 109, 119.\n The ‘publicly known’ aspect of this is of importance as states would rarely wish to acknowledge weaknesses in their cyber defence.\n For example, NATO has held numerous discussions about cyber security, and its members have stated readiness to pledge mutual defence in response to a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, which illustrates further the importance of finding a definition for such attacks. See Wales Summit Declaration (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Wales, 5 September 2014) [72]. See also Warsaw Summit Communique (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Warsaw 8–9 July 2016, 9 July 2016) [70]; Brussels Summit Declaration (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels 11–12 July 2018, 11 July 2018) [20].\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 339, rule 71.\n The attacks are selected for this analysis based on their significance for debates on cyberattacks and the law on the use of force.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries. There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks. Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states. The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008, there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’. One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force, Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks. The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet. Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months. Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n Ibid.\n Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers. However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’. While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities. Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.

Speculation has suggested that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attacks, something that has been denied by the United States, whereas Israel has refrained from commenting on its responsibility.\n## 5.3.2 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Force’\nThat states consider cyberattacks to fall within the rules of the UN Charter was (implicitly) confirmed by states in the World Summit Outcome in 2005, and can further be seen in numerous statements and documents. However, the problem remains regarding how to decide whether or not a cyberattack can be considered as ‘force’. The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad-\n Ibid.\n See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n\n See, e.g., *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nitionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nthe attacks and why. From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force, Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’. Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force. For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362. See also Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nby the non-state actor have been so directed and controlled by the supporting state as to be attributable to that state. The second is to use the definition of ‘indirect aggression’ as stated in Article 3(g) of the UN General Assembly’s 1974 Definition of Aggression. This is not the place to engage in a substantive discussion of which test is more appropriate, indeed this has been done elsewhere. Rather, the discussion to come aims to shed light on the complications on establishing responsibility in situations where the relevant conduct, or parts thereof, is unacknowledged.\nStarting first with attributability, there are two established tests for assessing whether the acts of a non-state group are attributable to a state. The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua and again in the Genocide Case, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic. Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies. The responsibility\n See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that\n[w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nalso includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’. With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility. That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence. First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n See Section 5.3.4.4.\n An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nStill, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state. In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’. Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes, has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence. However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n Ibid.\n Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nhas taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression $^{103}$ when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. $^{104}$ The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. $^{105}$ In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. $^{106}$ Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. $^{107}$ This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. $^{108}$\nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. $^{109}$ That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal\n$^{103}$ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n$^{104}$ Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n$^{105}$ Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n$^{106}$ Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139.

Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary, the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’, and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed, strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated. Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack. This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76]. See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 7–8 [3]–[4].\n See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 10 [5]; Alston, n 24, 14 [43]. This concerns the operations as a whole, see *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 41 [77].\n See, e.g., Ruys, n 106, 519.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1, 349.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.4 CYBERATTACKS &amp; DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION\nrequirement in relation to cyberattacks entirely to experts is, therefore, problematic and presents a potential danger with state silence in relation to cyberattacks.\n## 5.4 Cyberattacks and the Dynamic Interpretation of Jus ad Bellum\nIt is clear that the cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran have had great influence on debates around the application of the UN Charter to cyberattacks. Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force. This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'. The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference', but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill. It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n Ibid.\n Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks. As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future. As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.5 CONCLUSION\nas a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

      "flat_text": "## 5.1 Introduction\nUnacknowledged operations can differ significantly in their level of public knowledge and debate, ranging from acts shrouded in secrecy to acts that are widely reported and debated by other states, IGOs, international legal scholars, and NGOs.\nTechnological developments creating the possibility for devastating cyberattacks make urgent a discussion on the very understanding of what constitutes force, and in what ways – and against whom – states may respond to them. Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.\n See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state, and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law. This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law, such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known, even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states. That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force. This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23. A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled. Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nto the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars. In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN. The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’. Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’. Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’. Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n Ibid.\n Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html. See also, Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, declining to comment: ‘There is nothing I can say about this subject’ in Ulf Laessing and Khalid Abdelaziz, ‘Sudan Blames Israeli Air Strike Hit for Munitions Plant Blasts’, Reuters UK, 24 October 2012, available at http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-planes-idUSBRE89N0WU20121024.\n Laessing and Abdelaziz, ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nThe attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session. The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence. The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States, but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n Ibid.\n Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes. However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation. There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack. At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development. The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law. An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them. On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law. If true, and it is argued here that it\n See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nscholarly works. Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states. Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks. At the same time, in cases where\n See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice’ (2018) 112 *American Journal of International Law* 583, highlighting that ‘[a]t the same time, the interest shown recently by multiple states in collectively attributing international responsibility for global cyberoperations, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, may reflect a conscious decision on their part to invoke an international law framework, with a view to facilitating a coordinated overt response, which could enjoy broad international legitimacy’ and that this can be ‘a critical juncture for the development of international law regulating cyberoperations in which national security considerations militating in favor of maintaining operational latitude through silence and ambiguity may be gradually giving way to the communicative and norm-consolidation imperatives of collective action and applying the pressures of public diplomacy’: at 649.\n These attacks are chosen due to their visibility in the legal debates around the use of force and self-defence.\n As Matthew Waxman has argued:\nresponses and reactions to cyber attacks will probably involve high levels of government secrecy. The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret. Defenders too, though, may be reluctant to disclose details or even the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\ncyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.\nEven though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously. While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.\n## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran\nDespite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*. Although states have been\nvery existence of cyber attacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.\nMatthew C Waxman, ‘Self-Defensive Force against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 109, 119.\n The ‘publicly known’ aspect of this is of importance as states would rarely wish to acknowledge weaknesses in their cyber defence.\n For example, NATO has held numerous discussions about cyber security, and its members have stated readiness to pledge mutual defence in response to a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, which illustrates further the importance of finding a definition for such attacks. See Wales Summit Declaration (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Wales, 5 September 2014) [72]. See also Warsaw Summit Communique (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Warsaw 8–9 July 2016, 9 July 2016) [70]; Brussels Summit Declaration (issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels 11–12 July 2018, 11 July 2018) [20].\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 339, rule 71.\n The attacks are selected for this analysis based on their significance for debates on cyberattacks and the law on the use of force.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries. There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks. Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states. The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008, there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’. One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. When prompted by a reporter,\n Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n Ibid.\n ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force, Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks. The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet. Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months. Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342. See also Harrisson Dinnis, n 8 stating that the ‘Stuxnet worm … is perhaps the clearest example to date of a computer network attack amounting to a use of force (if not an armed attack)’: at 57.\n See Section 5.3.4.\n David E Sanger, ‘Obama Ordered Wave of Cyberattacks against Iran’, The New York Times (online), 1 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html. Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n Ibid.\n Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers. However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’. While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities. Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010. In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was\n2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged . . .

Speculation has suggested that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attacks, something that has been denied by the United States, whereas Israel has refrained from commenting on its responsibility.\n## 5.3.2 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Force’\nThat states consider cyberattacks to fall within the rules of the UN Charter was (implicitly) confirmed by states in the World Summit Outcome in 2005, and can further be seen in numerous statements and documents. However, the problem remains regarding how to decide whether or not a cyberattack can be considered as ‘force’. The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad-\n Ibid.\n See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n\n See, e.g., *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nitionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nthe attacks and why. From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force, Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’. Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force. For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362. See also Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nby the non-state actor have been so directed and controlled by the supporting state as to be attributable to that state. The second is to use the definition of ‘indirect aggression’ as stated in Article 3(g) of the UN General Assembly’s 1974 Definition of Aggression. This is not the place to engage in a substantive discussion of which test is more appropriate, indeed this has been done elsewhere. Rather, the discussion to come aims to shed light on the complications on establishing responsibility in situations where the relevant conduct, or parts thereof, is unacknowledged.\nStarting first with attributability, there are two established tests for assessing whether the acts of a non-state group are attributable to a state. The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua and again in the Genocide Case, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic. Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies. The responsibility\n See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that\n[w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nalso includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’. With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility. That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence. First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n See Section 5.3.4.4.\n An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nStill, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state. In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’. Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes, has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence. However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n Ibid.\n Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nhas taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression $^{103}$ when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. $^{104}$ The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. $^{105}$ In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. $^{106}$ Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. $^{107}$ This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. $^{108}$\nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. $^{109}$ That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal\n$^{103}$ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n$^{104}$ Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n$^{105}$ Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n$^{106}$ Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139.

Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary, the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’, and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed, strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76]. See also Wilmshurst n 102, 5,7, 10.\nCorrespondence between Great Britain and the United States, respecting the Arrest and Imprisonment of Mr McLeod, for the Destruction of the Steamboat Caroline (March, April 1841) 29 British Foreign and State Papers (1840–41) 1126.\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.5.4.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.3.4.4 Cyberattacks and Proportionality\nDespite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be proportionate, the assessment of this criteria is far from clear, and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations. The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated. Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack. This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76]. See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 7–8 [3]–[4].\n See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 10 [5]; Alston, n 24, 14 [43]. This concerns the operations as a whole, see *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 41 [77].\n See, e.g., Ruys, n 106, 519.\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1, 349.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.4 CYBERATTACKS &amp; DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION\nrequirement in relation to cyberattacks entirely to experts is, therefore, problematic and presents a potential danger with state silence in relation to cyberattacks.\n## 5.4 Cyberattacks and the Dynamic Interpretation of Jus ad Bellum\nIt is clear that the cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran have had great influence on debates around the application of the UN Charter to cyberattacks. Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force. This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'. The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference', but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill. It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n Ibid.\n Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks. As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future. As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.5 CONCLUSION\nas a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n131\n## 5.2 Different Levels of Publicity of Unacknowledged Acts\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nto the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars.¹³ In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN.¹⁴ The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html. See also, Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, declining to comment: ‘There is nothing I can say about this subject’ in Ulf Laessing and Khalid Abdelaziz, ‘Sudan Blames Israeli Air Strike Hit for Munitions Plant Blasts’, Reuters UK, 24 October 2012, available at http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-planes-idUSBRE89N0WU20121024.\n¹⁸ Laessing and Abdelaziz, ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nThe attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session.¹⁹ The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence.²⁰ The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States,²¹ but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²²\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n²⁴ Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n137\nIn yet other situations, states may choose not to react to covert operations even where they are reported and debated by other actors. The next section, therefore, turns to the question of in what ways unacknowledged conduct may affect the law when states and international governmental organisations remain silent.\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation.²⁵ There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n²⁵ For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack.²⁶ At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development.²⁷ The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n²⁶ Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n²⁷ Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32  n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n139\nThe difficulty of considering unacknowledged acts as claims becomes evident through a closer look the US drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and 2010.²⁸ Would it, for example, be possible to identify any claims made by the United States through its drone strikes before the Obama administration started providing legal justifications for its drone strikes in March 2010? While the potential effects of the later, quasi-covert version of the drone programs were discussed in the previous chapter, what is considered here is the effect of the earlier phases of the drone programs on the development of international law. It is important to remember that the programs lasted for several years, and grew to quite large dimensions before the United States started to provide legal justifications for them. Although the first drone strike outside of an area of active hostilities took place in Yemen in 2002, and the first drone strike in Pakistan was conducted in 2004, it took until 2010 for the United States to begin to provide legal justifications for the strikes. Between 2004 and March 2010, there were over 100 drone attacks in Pakistan alone, killing hundreds of people, many of them civilian.²⁹\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.³⁰\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law.³¹ An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n²⁸ Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n²⁹ See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n³⁰ This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n³¹ See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 ; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them.³² On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.³³\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons.³⁴ First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law.³⁵ If true, and it is argued here that it\n³² See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n³³ See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n³⁴ It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary  together with conclusion 5, commentary .\n³⁵ Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nscholarly works.³⁶ Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states.³⁷ Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.³⁸\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks.³⁹ At the same time, in cases where\n³⁶ See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n³⁷ Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf?

The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries.⁴⁴ There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks.⁴⁵ Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states.⁴⁶ The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.⁴⁷\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008,⁴⁸ there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’.⁴⁹ One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.⁵⁰ When prompted by a reporter,\n⁴⁴ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n⁴⁵ Ibid.\n⁴⁶ ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n⁴⁷ Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n⁴⁸ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n⁴⁹ In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force,⁵² Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks.⁵³ The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet.⁵⁴ Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months.⁵⁵ Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.⁵⁶\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n⁵¹ ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n⁵² See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342. See also Harrisson Dinnis, n 8 stating that the ‘Stuxnet worm … is perhaps the clearest example to date of a computer network attack amounting to a use of force (if not an armed attack)’: at 57.\n⁵³ See Section 5.3.4.\n⁵⁴ David E Sanger, ‘Obama Ordered Wave of Cyberattacks against Iran’, The New York Times (online), 1 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html. Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers.⁵⁷ However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’.⁵⁸ While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities.⁵⁹ Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.⁶⁰\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.⁶¹ In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was\n2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n⁵⁷ Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged . . .

The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad-\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n⁶⁴ 2005 World Summit Outcome, GA Res 60/1, UN Doc A/RES/60/1 (24 October 2005) .

A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 ; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, .\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nitionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n66 Duncan B Hollis, ‘Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations’ (2007) 11 Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review 1023, 1041.

Another way of addressing the shortcomings of too strong a focus on destruction rejects the existence of a clear line between instrument based and effect based approaches and instead suggests determining the use of force by the instrument, while determining the instrument based on its effects. See Roscini, n 36, arguing that: ‘weapons are identified by their effects . . . armed force . . . could be defined as the form of intervention . . . that involves the use of instruments (weapons) capable of producing violent consequences’: at 50. Roscini notably argues this with reference to the ICJ’s interpretation of support of armed groups as force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n72 See discussion in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.\n73 The definition of a cyberattack as force is complicated by the lack of a common agreement as to what constitute NCI. Indeed the UN General Assembly has stressed that this is something to be determined independently by states, see, e.g., Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures, GA Res 58/99, UN Doc A/RES/58/199 (30 January 2004). A helpful overview of state practice by Roscini, n 36, 55–60, shows that it is, however, possible to point out some commonalities between states: it is clear that NCI is focused on national security, and that this includes security on the societal, governmental, and individual level, such as ‘banking and finance, government, communications, emergency and rescue services, public health, transportation, food and water supply and energy’: at 58.\n74 For different views on this compare Roscini, n 36 and Harrison Dinniss, n 8, with the former accepting such practice as relevant and the latter significantly downplaying the value of verbal statements not produced in response to a public physical act.\n75 ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, n 51.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n76 See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\n77 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1.\n78 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 333–7.\n79 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1, 1–11.\n80 See, e.g., Yaroslav Radziwill, Cyber-Attacks and the Exploitable Imperfection of International Law (Brill Nijhoff, 2015) 8–9; Kristen E Eichensehr, ‘Book Review: Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare’ (2014) 108 American Journal of International Law 585, 585.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nthe attacks and why.⁸¹ From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force,⁸² Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’.⁸³ Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force.⁸⁴ For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8.

The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility\n⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 14, 103–4  (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 168, 222–3  (‘Armed Activities’).\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n⁸⁸ See Nicaragua (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 14, 62 , stating that\n[w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n⁸⁹ Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 43.\n⁹⁰ Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n⁹¹ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nalso includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’.⁹² With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶\n⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nStill, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 4.\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nhas taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression $^{103}$ when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. $^{104}$ The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. $^{105}$ In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. $^{106}$ Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. $^{107}$ This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. $^{108}$\nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. $^{109}$ That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal\n$^{103}$ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n$^{104}$ Nicaragua (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 168.\n$^{105}$ Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 161, 195  ('Oil Platforms').\n$^{106}$ Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139.

Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^^\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n^^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary,¹¹³ the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’,¹¹⁴ and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed,¹¹⁵ strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n¹¹³ See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 14, 94 ; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 226, 245 ; Oil Platforms  ICJ Rep 161, 183 , 196 –, 198 .

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated.¹¹⁷ Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack.¹¹⁸ This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.¹¹⁹\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n¹¹⁶ See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)*  ICJ Rep 14, 94 ; *Oil Platforms*  ICJ Rep 161, 183 , 196–7 –, 198 .

Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force.¹²⁰ This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'.¹²¹ The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference',¹²² but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill.¹²³ It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n¹²¹ Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n¹²² Ibid.\n¹²³ Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks.¹²⁴ As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future.¹²⁵ As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n¹²⁴ Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575.

(eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n¹²⁵ See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.5 CONCLUSION\nas a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

      "flat_text": "## 5.1 Introduction\nUnacknowledged operations can differ significantly in their level of public knowledge and debate, ranging from acts shrouded in secrecy to acts that are widely reported and debated by other states, IGOs, international legal scholars, and NGOs.\nTechnological developments creating the possibility for devastating cyberattacks make urgent a discussion on the very understanding of what constitutes force, and in what ways – and against whom – states may respond to them. Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS ## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States While it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷ In cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents... have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸ However, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to ⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY the initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰ As discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s) ¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS to the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars.¹³ In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN.¹⁴ The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸ (online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html. See also, Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, declining to comment: ‘There is nothing I can say about this subject’ in Ulf Laessing and Khalid Abdelaziz, ‘Sudan Blames Israeli Air Strike Hit for Munitions Plant Blasts’, Reuters UK, 24 October 2012, available at http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-planes-idUSBRE89N0WU20121024.\n¹⁸ Laessing and Abdelaziz, ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY The attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session.¹⁹ The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence.²⁰ The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States,²¹ but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²² In summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS In relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2. See, e.g., Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) annex, 3.\n²⁴ Letter Dated 12 October 2012 from the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2012/843 (15 November 2012) Annex; Letter Dated 19 July 2013 from the Chair of the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo Addressed to the President of the Security Council – Midterm Report of the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN Doc S/2013/433 (19 July 2013); Christoph Heyns, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, UN Doc A/68/382 (4 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/68/389 (18 September 2013); Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur, Report on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms While Countering Terrorism, UN Doc A/HRC/25/59 (28 February 2014); Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur, Report on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Study on Targeted Killings, UN Doc A/HRC/14/24/Add.6 1 (28 May 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation.²⁵ There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n²⁵ For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nUNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack.²⁶ At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development.²⁷ The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n²⁶ Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n²⁷ Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158. For a similar discussion regarding ‘shared understandings’, see Jutta Brunnée and Stephen J Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 65 ff. This argument is also consistent with what Michael Wood is suggesting in his Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (22 May 2014) 32 [47] n 144, quoting H Meijers, ‘How Is International Law Made? The Stages of Growth of International Law and the Use of Its Customary Rules’ (1978) 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 3. For a discussion on the value of acknowledgement, see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.³⁰ As discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law.³¹ An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the ²⁸ Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n²⁹ See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n³⁰ This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n³¹ See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS acts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them.³² On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.³³ Turning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons.³⁴ First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law.³⁵ If true, and it is argued here that it ³² See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n³³ See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n³⁴ It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n³⁵ Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law, xv, arguing that https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS is, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules The second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks The increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous [i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS scholarly works.³⁶ Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states.³⁷ Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.³⁸ Despite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks.³⁹ At the same time, in cases where ³⁶ See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n³⁷ Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice’ (2018) 112 *American Journal of International Law* 583, highlighting that ‘[a]t the same time, the interest shown recently by multiple states in collectively attributing international responsibility for global cyberoperations, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, may reflect a conscious decision on their part to invoke an international law framework, with a view to facilitating a coordinated overt response, which could enjoy broad international legitimacy’ and that this can be ‘a critical juncture for the development of international law regulating cyberoperations in which national security considerations militating in favor of maintaining operational latitude through silence and ambiguity may be gradually giving way to the communicative and norm-consolidation imperatives of collective action and applying the pressures of public diplomacy’: at 649.\n³⁸ These attacks are chosen due to their visibility in the legal debates around the use of force and self-defence.\n³⁹ As Matthew Waxman has argued: responses and reactions to cyber attacks will probably involve high levels of government secrecy. The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret. Defenders too, though, may be reluctant to disclose details or even the https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS cyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.⁴⁰ Even though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously.⁴¹ While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.⁴² ## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran Despite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*.⁴³ Although states have been very existence of cyber attacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.\nMatthew C Waxman, ‘Self-Defensive Force against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 109, 119.\n⁴⁰ The ‘publicly known’ aspect of this is of importance as states would rarely wish to acknowledge weaknesses in their cyber defence.\n⁴¹ For example, NATO has held numerous discussions about cyber security, and its members have stated readiness to pledge mutual defence in response to a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, which illustrates further the importance of finding a definition for such attacks.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries.⁴⁴ There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks.⁴⁵ Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states.⁴⁶ The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.⁴⁷ Although sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008,⁴⁸ there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’.⁴⁹ One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.⁵⁰ When prompted by a reporter, ⁴⁴ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n⁴⁵ Ibid.\n⁴⁶ ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n⁴⁷ Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n⁴⁸ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n⁴⁹ In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force,⁵² Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks.⁵³ The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet.⁵⁴ Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months.⁵⁵ Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.⁵⁶ [t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n⁵¹ ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n⁵² See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n⁵⁶ Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS There are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers.⁵⁷ However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’.⁵⁸ While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities.⁵⁹ Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.⁶⁰ The Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.⁶¹ In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was 2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n⁵⁷ Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged... Investigations show that some private software of the power plant’s employees have been contaminated’.

The question is not simply one of deciding upon a threshold, but it also involves significant methodological choices, and there are different approaches to assessing whether or not a cyberattack falls within the scope of the prohibition of the use of force.\nThe instrument-based approach, as the name suggests, focuses on the weapons that are used to conduct the attack in question, and holds as ‘force’ those activities that bear ‘physical characteristics’ that are ‘trad- ⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ See, e.g., Thomas Erdbrink and Joby Warrick, ‘Iranian Scientist Involved in Nuclear Program Killed in Tehran Bomb Attack’, *The Washington Post* (online), 11 January 2012, available at www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran-bomb-attack/2012/01/11/gIQAT1V7pP_story.html.\n⁶⁴ 2005 World Summit Outcome, GA Res 60/1, UN Doc A/RES/60/1 (24 October 2005) [79]. The paragraph restated belief in the Charter rules as being able to deal with new security threats.\n⁶⁵ See, e.g., *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc. A/71/172 (19 July 2016) 8 (submission by Cuba), 20 (submission by Spain), 24 (submission by the United Kingdom); *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, Report of the Secretary-General, UN Doc. A/70/172 (22 July 2015) 7 (submission by Germany). See also, e.g., US Department of Defense, ‘Cyberspace Policy Report of 2011’ (2011), stating that ‘[i]nternational legal norms, such as those found in the UN Charter and the law of armed conflict, which apply to the physical domains (i.e., sea, air, land, and space), also apply to the cyberspace domain’: at 9; *Report by Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013) 8 [19]; NATO, *Wales Summit Declaration*, n 41, [72].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS itionally associated with military coercion'.66 In contrast, the effects based (or consequence based) approach, is more interested in the actual damage created by the cyberattack than the means used. The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS As discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS discussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76 The most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80 In addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS the attacks and why.⁸¹ From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force,⁸² Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’.⁸³ Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force.⁸⁴ For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks One of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts ⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362.

The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility ⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n⁸⁸ See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that [w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n⁸⁹ Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n⁹⁰ Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n⁹¹ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS also includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’.⁹² With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴ The issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶ ⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS Still, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹ ## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence Cyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹ ## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’ The relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and ⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS has taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality As discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. \nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139. Though see Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defence (Cambridge University Press, 5th ed., 2011), suggesting that the concept of an armed attack is narrower than aggression as 'aggression in its generic meaning could potentially be stretched to include mere threats': at 197.\n Dinstein, ibid. This view is also supported by the ICJ. See, e.g., Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146].\n See Chapter 4, Section 4.5.4.2.\n Garwood-Gowers, n 101; Marty Lederman, 'Question on 2007 Strike against Syria and Anticipatory Self-Defense' on opinio juris (6 April 2012), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2012/04/06/question-on-2007-strike-against-syria-and-anticipatory-self-defense.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS understanding of imminence, or a setting aside of the imminence requirement altogether with regard to the right to self-defence, at least against nuclear threats, is, however, not convincing. Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^ Israel is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks ^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now. But it's the kind of threat you have to operate under the assumption that it is tomorrow', in Ken Dilianian, 'US Offers More Nuanced Take on Khorasan Threat', CBS News/Associated Press, 25 September 2014, available at www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-offers-more-nuanced-take-on-khorasan-threat.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS against Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity Cyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary,¹¹³ the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’,¹¹⁴ and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed,¹¹⁵ strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n¹¹³ See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated.¹¹⁷ Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack.¹¹⁸ This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.¹¹⁹ The difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality ¹¹⁶ See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76]. See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 7–8 [3]–[4].\n¹¹⁷ See also Wilmshurst, n 102, 10 [5]; Alston, n 24, 14 [43]. This concerns the operations as a whole, see *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 41 [77].\n¹¹⁸ See, e.g., Ruys, n 106, 519.\n¹¹⁹ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1, 349.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.4 CYBERATTACKS &amp; DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION requirement in relation to cyberattacks entirely to experts is, therefore, problematic and presents a potential danger with state silence in relation to cyberattacks.\n## 5.4 Cyberattacks and the Dynamic Interpretation of Jus ad Bellum It is clear that the cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran have had great influence on debates around the application of the UN Charter to cyberattacks. Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force.¹²⁰ This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'.¹²¹ The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference',¹²² but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill.¹²³ It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where ¹²⁰ See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n¹²¹ Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583 ¹²² Ibid.\n¹²³ Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere,\"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on\"Practice\",\"Growth\", and\"Dissemination\"(2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS reactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks.¹²⁴ As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future.¹²⁵ As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n## 5.5 Conclusion As demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve ¹²⁴ Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n¹²⁵ See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.5 CONCLUSION as a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS ## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States While it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷ In cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents... have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸ However, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to ⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY the initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰ As discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s) ¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471. Further reports of strikes came later in the year, but are far too uncertain to be helpful for closer analysis. See Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel, 'Reports in Sudan: Israel Struck Two Weapons Convoys in Past Month', Haaretz https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS to the UN Security Council, and they were also subject to very little debate amongst states or international legal scholars.¹³ In contrast, the attack against the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum on 24 October 2012 was immediately reported to the UN Security Council by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the UN.¹⁴ The letter stated, as did media reports, that the factory had been ‘subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force’ resulting in the death of two civilians and the injury of a third. Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸ (online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html.

It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²² In summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS In relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.

Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts ⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n\n⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362. See also Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS by the non-state actor have been so directed and controlled by the supporting state as to be attributable to that state.⁸⁵ The second is to use the definition of ‘indirect aggression’ as stated in Article 3(g) of the UN General Assembly’s 1974 Definition of Aggression.⁸⁶ This is not the place to engage in a substantive discussion of which test is more appropriate, indeed this has been done elsewhere.⁸⁷ Rather, the discussion to come aims to shed light on the complications on establishing responsibility in situations where the relevant conduct, or parts thereof, is unacknowledged.\nStarting first with attributability, there are two established tests for assessing whether the acts of a non-state group are attributable to a state. The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility ⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex. This definition has been used by the ICJ when assessing whether or not an armed attack had occurred. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v United States of America) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 103–4 [195] (‘Nicaragua’); and Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, 222–3 [146] (‘Armed Activities’).\n⁸⁷ See, e.g., James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 115 ff; Roscini, n 36, 80 ff; Draft Articles on State Responsibility, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, art. 8.\n⁸⁸ See Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 62 [109], stating that [w]hat the Court has to determine at this point is whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.\n⁸⁹ Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Judgment) [2007] ICJ Rep 43.\n⁹⁰ Prosecutor v Tadic (Judgement) (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Case No IT-94-1-A, 15 July 1999).\n⁹¹ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 87, rule 15.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS also includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’.⁹² With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴ The issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶ ⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS Still, this is not to say that the difficulty of finding evidence necessarily is without effect on the evidence requirements. In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹ ## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence Cyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹ ## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’ The relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and ⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press 5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS has taken a starting point in the UN General Assembly's Definition of Aggression when assessing whether an armed attack has occurred, both in the Nicaragua case in 1986, and again in the Armed Activities case in 2005. The difference in the Court's interpretation of force and armed attack should, however, not be overstated. In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.",

    "5\n\n# Unacknowledged Operations\n\n## 5.1 Introduction\n\nUnacknowledged operations can differ significantly in their level of public knowledge and debate, ranging from acts shrouded in secrecy to acts that are widely reported and debated by other states, IGOs, international legal scholars, and NGOs.\n\nTechnological developments creating the possibility for devastating cyberattacks make urgent a discussion on the very understanding of what constitutes force, and in what ways – and against whom – states may respond to them. Indeed, use of new technology raises questions as to the definition of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’, at the same time as it allows for greater anonymity of the actor(s) involved. As discussed, covert uses of force and the debates that follow them can significantly affect the interpretation of the meaning of ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, as well as the scope of the right to use force in self-defence.\n\nThe following section discusses in more detail the different levels of publicity of unacknowledged acts, including covert conduct that may serve as a trigger for the state practice of other states, as well as publicly known conduct to which states remain silent. The latter first returns to the discussion of silence and acquiescence, before considering the extent to which unacknowledged acts may serve as a focal point for legal debate and in so doing be influential for the interpretation and development of the rules regulating the resort to force. Section 5.3 then relates this discussion to the debates around cyberattacks and the law on the use of force through the illustrations of the attacks against Estonia (2007) and Iran (2010). Finally, Section 5.4 adds some concluding thoughts around how unacknowledged operations that are publicly known create expanded space for the influence of legal scholars and other experts within the development of jus ad bellum.¹\n\n¹ See, especially, Michael N Schmitt (general editor), *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017); Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, *Tallinn Manual*\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n131\n\n## 5.2 Different Levels of Publicity of Unacknowledged Acts\n\nUnacknowledged operations can vary greatly in their level of publicity, and in order to assess the value of, and challenges presented by, recent technological developments, it is important to examine these different levels more closely. Unacknowledged operations do not necessarily constitute ‘claims’ by the acting state,² and silence from other states thus does not necessarily signal acceptance of the act as one in accordance with international law.³ This, however, is not to say that unacknowledged operations have no role to play in the development of international law. While most international legal scholars would not hold unacknowledged acts as directly relevant state practice for the purpose of the development of customary international law,⁴ such acts may have important indirect effects on the development of customary rules, and they may also inform debates regarding the interpretation of the UN Charter rules on the use of force. In order to have such effects, the act in question needs to have been made publicly known to some extent, and the examination in this chapter is therefore limited to unacknowledged acts that have been made publicly known,⁵ even if only through media reports.\n\nWhen understanding international law as a communicative process to be identified through articulated claims and responses, it is easy at first glance to reject the thought that conduct that is neither acknowledged nor justified may affect the development of the law. This assumption, however, is in need of closer scrutiny, as it is necessary to examine more closely the ways and forms in which a state may communicate its legal position, as well as how responses by states and other actors may shape the development of *jus ad bellum*.\n\non the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare Prepared by the International Group of Experts at the Invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Cambridge University Press, 2013).\n\n² As discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.1, a ‘claim’ as used in this thesis is ‘an act or expression to which affirmations or non-reactions may lead to alterations of the law’.\n\n³ Some will, however, argue that physical acts in themselves may constitute claims even in the absence of acknowledgements and legal justifications, especially so where the practice in question is repeated. See, e.g., Arthur M Weisburd, ‘Customary International Law: The Problem of Treaties’ (1988) 21 *Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law* 1, 35. See further, Section 5.2.\n\n⁴ Further, it is not necessary for a state to acknowledge an act for that act to be ‘public’ under all theories of custom. As will be seen, some scholars, such as those preferring the policy-oriented approach, are more interested in the reactions and debates that follow an ‘incident’, rather than the acknowledgement from the state itself.\n\n⁵ For a discussion on public knowledge, see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\n## 5.2.1 Unacknowledged Operations Triggering Reactions by Other States\n\nWhile it is problematic to identify covert operations as claims in themselves, it is not uncommon for unacknowledged acts to spark reactions amongst other states.⁶ That such responses can affect the development of international law is not necessarily controversial; as discussed shortly, the way in which the responses will be appreciated depends on the nature of the reaction as well as on the methodological approach taken to analysing the development of international law, in particular with regard to the respective value of verbal and physical acts.⁷\n\nIn cases where states react in a physical manner while clearly justifying their actions with reference to international law, it is not contested that such reactions will be relevant for the development of the law, as they are both physical and verbal in nature with clear expressions of *opinio juris*. In situations where the reactions to a covert use of force are only verbal in nature, there will be some restrictions as to the way in which those reactions may affect the law if approached through the lens of accounts that require public physical state practice to form the basis of a legally relevant debate. Although such a strict approach would be unlikely to gain any traction in contemporary international law, it has been suggested that states’ verbal reactions have less weight where they do not relate to attributable, physical, acts. For example, Heather Harrison Dinniss argues in relation to cyberattacks that ‘one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents . . . have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use’.⁸\n\nHowever, an act serving as trigger will have a potential effect on the development of the law according to most accounts of custom regardless of whether the reactions come in the form of verbal expressions, economic sanctions, or uses of force.⁹ This said, verbal statements would be particularly effective if presented as a justification for a physical reaction to\n\n⁶ Recent examples of this include Russia’s alleged support of the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda’s alleged support of the M23 rebellion. See discussion in Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n\n⁷ The value of verbal and physical state practice is discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n\n⁸ Heather Harrison Dinniss, *Cyberwarfare and the Laws of War* (Cambridge University Press, 2012) 53.\n\n⁹ See, e.g., ILC, *Identification of Customary International Law: Text of the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*, UN Doc A/73/10 (2018) (*Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law*) 133, conclusion 6.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nthe initial, covert, act. The right to use force in self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter serves as an excellent case in point. Imagine for example that State A is claiming a right to use kinetic force in self-defence against State B, which has conducted a severely damaging cyberattack on State A. That State B denies its involvement in the attack does not affect the qualification of A's act as state practice, but this is rather dependent on the facts of the case including the level of evidence that State A has of B's responsibility for the attack, as well as on the way in which State A's reaction and justifications are received by other states. In other words, once there has been a public reaction of this kind, it does not matter that the initial act by State B was covert in nature. The theoretical discussion here is thus the same as for overt acts, with the difference that it puts the state responsible for the first attack in the backseat of the (legal) debate that follows that attack.¹⁰\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, recent examples of covert operations leading to reactions amongst states include Russia's support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine and Rwanda's support of the M23.¹¹ A further example of reactions to unacknowledged conduct is the Israeli attack on the Yarmouk military factory in Khartoum, Sudan in 2012. The attack followed a number of attacks by Israel on Sudanese territory between 2009 and 2011, most notably in January 2009 when 'Israeli fighter-bombers backed by unmanned drones' reportedly targeted a twenty-three-truck convoy, killing 119 people including smugglers and people being smuggled.¹² Sudan did not at the time report the attack(s)\n\n¹⁰ This can, of course, change if the state becomes willing to engage in the debate at a later stage. The value of delayed acknowledgements and justifications for the development of international law are discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2.\n¹¹ See Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.\n¹² See, e.g., Time Staff, 'How Israel Foiled an Arms Convoy Bound for Hamas', Time (online), 30 March 2009, available at http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888352,00.html; 'Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media' Reuters, 25 May 2009, available at www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-attack-idUS TRE54O4FA20090525. Around the same time, another strike sunk a ship in the Red Sea for the same purpose. It should be noted that the information regarding the number of attacks differs. What is clear is that regardless of whether it was followed by other attacks, at least one attack took place in mid-January 2009. The next reported Israeli strike on Sudan took place in April 2011 when a missile struck a land cruiser in Port Sudan, reportedly targeting prominent members of Hamas. See Avi Issacharoff and Reuters, 'Report: Hamas Arms Trafficker Killed in Sudan Air Strike', Haaretz (online) 6 April 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-hamas-arms-trafficker-killed-in-sudan-air-strike-1.354471.

Sudan called the attack an ‘act of aggression’ and ‘a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the sovereignty of Sudan’.¹⁵ Although Israel did not publicly respond to the allegations, Israeli officials have in non-official settings ‘confirmed the obvious’.¹⁶ Further, the Israeli minister of strategic affairs, Moshe Yaalon, has spoken openly about both the problematic role of Sudan in the region, and how Iran exploits areas that are ‘not properly governed’.¹⁷ Yaalon has also confirmed that ‘Sudan is a country of that kind’.¹⁸\n\n(online), 25 December 2011, available at www.haaretz.com/israel-news/reports-in-sudan-israel-struck-two-weapons-convoys-in-past-month-1.403521.\n\n¹³ This is perhaps unsurprising considering the status of the Sudanese government and the continued seriousness of the situation in Darfur. The lack of condemnation may also be due to the obvious breach of the Iranian weapon ban, and the political acceptance of the international community of measures thwarting such attempts by Iran. The Sudanese minister for defence presented the matter to the Sudanese parliament in late 2009, but admitted that they were still investigating exactly what happened, see ‘Air Strike on Sudan Convoy Killed 119: State Media’, ibid.\n\n¹⁴ See, Letter Dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/790 (25 October 2012).\n\n¹⁵ Ibid.\n\n¹⁶ Ian Black and Phoebe Greenwood, ‘Israel Accused of Air Strike on Sudan Munitions Factory’, The Guardian (Tel Aviv), 25 October 2012, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/israel-accused-sudan-munitions-air-strike. It is not clear why this particular attack was reported to the Security Council, but it could possibly relate to existing certainty as to the responsibility for the attack, or to the nature of the target. While the 2009 and 2011 strikes targeted weapon transports originating from, and aiming for, places outside of Sudan, this attack directly targeted a factory as opposed to a moving vehicle. The Sudanese opposition has suggested that the factory, in fact, was owned by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, however, this has not been confirmed.\n\n¹⁷ Isabel Kershner, ‘Official Silence in Israel over Sudan’s Accusations of Air Attack’, The New York Times (online), 25 October 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/africa/official-silence-in-israel-over-sudans-accusations-of-air-attack.html.

    "5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n\nThe attack caught the attention of the League of Arab States and, on 12 November 2012, its Council adopted a decision condemning the Israeli ‘aggression’ at an extraordinary meeting session.¹⁹ The decision spoke in harsh words about the Israeli act, and also included an affirmation of Sudan’s right to self-defence.²⁰ The decision was forwarded to the UN Security Council by Sudan on behalf of the Council for the League of Arab States,²¹ but was not (openly) discussed in the Security Council. It is notable that the Arab League held the attack, which killed two people and injured a third, to be an ‘act of aggression’ and that it supported Sudan’s right to self-defence.²²\n\nIn summary, the assessment of the value of the reactions to covert operations is the same as the assessment of any public conduct, as long as there is certainty as to the facts of the original covert act: in situations where a covert operation sparks a physical response, this act in itself constitutes state practice for the development of international law. Thus, the covert act will have served as a trigger for public state conduct and indirectly affected the law, even if it (arguably) does not have any direct value in itself. However, where the covert operation only sparks verbal reactions amongst states, there are some limitations to the way in which the reactions may affect the development of the law. First of all, verbal reactions would be excluded under any account requiring claims to be based in physical practice. Secondly, while under other approaches the verbal reactions would still be considered valuable, they would not have the evidential support of physical acts, which would arguably make them weaker. Considering this, it would be difficult to argue that verbal practice alone in support of, or against, a covert act would constitute proof of a change in the interpretation of the law where there is already broad consensus, but it might be possible to strengthen a certain interpretation in cases of uncertainty, and it may serve to prove some agreement with existing law.\n\n¹⁹ See, The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, Decision No 7574, annexed to Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²⁰ Ibid.\n²¹ Letter Dated 17 November 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations Addressed to the President of the Security Council, UN Doc S/2012/864 (28 November 2012).\n²² The Israeli Aggression against the Yarmouk Plant in Khartoum, UN Doc S/2012/864.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nIn relation to reactions to by states, one more thing should be considered. When assessing state responses to covert operations where reactions by the attacked state are absent, an important question is to what accounts of events states, and other actors, are to react. In cases where the territorial state openly makes a complaint about an attack, its account will serve as a good starting point for the legal discussion. There might also be investigations by UN Groups of Experts, as was the case with Rwanda's support of the M23²³; or special rapporteurs, as with the US drone strikes.²⁴ However, in situations where there is no official reaction from the state where the attack has taken place, states and other international actors will have to react to reports and reactions to non-state accounts, including those of journalists and NGOs. While still serving as a trigger for the practice of other states (with the caveats just discussed), the effect is filtered, and potentially also altered by other actors before reaching states. This is not to say that state accounts would be more or less truthful than those presented by other actors, but it should be remembered that this potentially gives greater power to other actors to shape the debate, and thereby affect the reactions of third states.\n\n²³ For background, see Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.

    "5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n137\n\nIn yet other situations, states may choose not to react to covert operations even where they are reported and debated by other actors. The next section, therefore, turns to the question of in what ways unacknowledged conduct may affect the law when states and international governmental organisations remain silent.\n\n## 5.2.2 Publicly Known, but Unacknowledged, Acts to Which States Remain Silent\n\nNot all acts lead to outright reactions by other states or IGOs; as mentioned, in some cases even the attacked state chooses to remain silent on the issue. This can be due to a range of reasons, such as security, diplomacy, economic considerations, or a state's domestic or international political situation.²⁵ There are also a number of similar reasons why third states will not react to a reported act (with the possible addition of disinterest). While it is hardly controversial to state that unacknowledged conduct that sparks debate and reactions amongst states serves as a trigger for state practice, one important question remains: in what ways may unacknowledged conduct affect the law when states and IGOs remain silent? In order to answer this, we must address two sets of questions. The first regards the circumstances, if any, under which state silence in response to unacknowledged conduct may count as acquiescence as to its legality. The second is concerned with the dynamic interpretation of the rules on the use of force and the relevant actors within it.\n\n## 5.2.2.1 Acquiescence to Unacknowledged Acts\n\nThe question of whether or not silence in response to unacknowledged acts can be considered acquiescence in itself entails two separate enquiries: the first is whether or not a state can be held to be making a claim despite neither acknowledging nor seeking to provide justifications for, an act. The second enquiry concerns whether, and under what circumstances, states have a responsibility to react to events where there are no identifiable claims made by the acting state, but its operation is very well known internationally due to widespread reports in media and discussions by expert commentators. In other words, are there any situations\n\n²⁵ For an insightful discussion on the role of silence see Elisabeth Schweiger ‘Listen Closely: What Silence Can Tell Us about Legal Knowledge Production’ (2018) 6 London Review of International Law 391.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nwhere state silence regarding unacknowledged acts with a high level of public knowledge can be interpreted as acquiescence as to the legality of that act, even in the absence of a claim by the acting state?\n\nStarting with the first enquiry, an argument that unacknowledged acts should constitute claims could potentially be strengthened in cases where the conduct is repeated, and seemingly aimed towards a certain end, especially where the acting state has publicly commented on the threat posed by the target which they attack.²⁶ At the same time, there are valid arguments for an interpretation that does not consider the possibility of claims through unacknowledged conduct. There are two main reasons for this, both relating to the interpretation of silence. First of all, to identify unacknowledged acts as claims to which state silence may be interpreted as acquiescence is problematic since it may be very unclear what interpretation of the law states would be accepting. Secondly, as argued by, for example, Michael Byers in relation to the ‘legitimate expectations’ of states, states may not themselves consider the acts as possibly altering the law and may, therefore, remain silent with the belief that their silence does not affect legal development.²⁷ The first problem could potentially be solved by a requirement for it to be clear in the specific context under what (imagined or not) right the state has been acting, in order for an unacknowledged act to constitute a claim. The second issue is, however, not as easily dealt with. If states do not consider their silence as meaningful for the purpose of legal development (even where they are ‘specially affected’), then the silence should not be interpreted as acquiescence to a certain interpretation of the law.\n\n²⁶ Weisburd, n 3, 35; Theresa Reinold, ‘State Weakness, Irregular Warfare, and the Right to Self-Defense Post 9/11’ (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law 244; Christian Schaller, ‘Using Force against Terrorists “Outside Areas of Active Hostilities” – The Obama Approach and the Bin Laden Raid Revisited’ (2015) 20 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 195, 227.\n\n²⁷ Michael Byers, Custom, Power and the Power of Rules: International Relations and Customary International Law (Cambridge University Press, 1999) 158.

    "5.2 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLICITY\n139\n\nThe difficulty of considering unacknowledged acts as claims becomes evident through a closer look the US drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and 2010.²⁸ Would it, for example, be possible to identify any claims made by the United States through its drone strikes before the Obama administration started providing legal justifications for its drone strikes in March 2010? While the potential effects of the later, quasi-covert version of the drone programs were discussed in the previous chapter, what is considered here is the effect of the earlier phases of the drone programs on the development of international law. It is important to remember that the programs lasted for several years, and grew to quite large dimensions before the United States started to provide legal justifications for them. Although the first drone strike outside of an area of active hostilities took place in Yemen in 2002, and the first drone strike in Pakistan was conducted in 2004, it took until 2010 for the United States to begin to provide legal justifications for the strikes. Between 2004 and March 2010, there were over 100 drone attacks in Pakistan alone, killing hundreds of people, many of them civilian.²⁹\n\nAs the intensity of the attacks grew, so did the intensity of reports and debates. Human rights groups and advocates in Pakistan, the United States, and Europe criticised the strikes, and international legal scholars soon started to evaluate nearly all aspects of their legality, including issues of *jus ad bellum*; in particular the right to self-defence against non-state actors and the status of the ‘unwilling or unable’ test.³⁰\n\nAs discussed, most scholars would not recognise unacknowledged conduct such as the US drone strikes during this period as relevant state practice, and as a claim for the development of international law.³¹ An argument may, however, be made that the large number of attacks conducted over several years qualifies as a claim as to the legality of the\n\n²⁸ Note here that the focus lies upon the acts as claims in themselves, and any reaction (or lack thereof) by the attacked state is only relevant as guidance as to its consent.\n\n²⁹ See, e.g., Bill Roggio, ‘Charting the Data for US Airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004–2015’, *The Long War Journal*, available at www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.\n\n³⁰ This despite the uncertainty of Pakistani consent. See, e.g., Sean D Murphy, ‘The International Legality of U.S. Military Cross-Border Operations’ (2009) 85 *International Law Studies* 109; Kenneth Anderson, ‘Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law’ (Working Paper of the Series on Counterterrorism and American Statutory Law, a joint project of the Brookings Institution, the Georgetown University Law Center, and the Hoover Institution, 11 May 2009).\n\n³¹ See, e.g., Wood, n 27, 32 [47]; Brunnée and Toope, n 27, 283; O A Elias and Lim C L, *The Paradox of Consensualism in International Law* (Kluwer Law International, 1998) 4.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nacts, especially as the United States did not outright deny them.³² On top of the issues with such an approach previously discussed, it would also be highly unclear exactly what the United States was claiming a right to do, and under what circumstances. That is, upon which interpretation of which rules was the United States relying? With regard to *jus ad bellum*, we also have the added complication that Pakistan at the time refrained from commenting on the drone strikes, making it very difficult to assess whether or not the strikes were conducted with, or without, its consent. These issues, again, strengthen the argument that conduct needs to be acknowledged and publicly known in order to constitute state practice, and in addition, in the absence of any justifications, anyone favouring verbal state practice and *opinio juris* would not find any claims within this conduct. As discussed in the previous chapter, the exclusion of the strikes during this period would be valid, even if later strikes have been partially acknowledged; especially as the later acknowledgements and justifications made no reference back to the earlier strikes.³³\n\nTurning to the second enquiry, to interpret silence regarding unacknowledged, but publicly debated, operations as acquiescence becomes problematic for a number of reasons.³⁴ First of all, as stated, if there really is a shared understanding amongst states that acknowledgement is needed for an act to qualify as relevant state practice, states will not necessarily think that their silence about unacknowledged acts may have consequences for the development of the law. In other words, they do not consider their silence as meaningful in this regard. Secondly, it would be very difficult to draw a line as to the width, intensity, and quality of the debate, as well as to the certainty as to the facts of the reported act, which would be required. Without such clear thresholds, states would be left with uncertainty as to when they would need to react for legal purposes.\n\nIn other words, acknowledgement may serve a purpose as a structural function, telling states when they do – and when they do not – need to address incidents, and thereby minimise anxieties regarding unwanted developments of international law.³⁵ If true, and it is argued here that it\n\n³² See especially Reinold, n 26, 283.\n³³ See Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.\n³⁴ It is concerning that this is seemingly the position of the ILC in the Draft Conclusions on the Identification of Customary International Law, UN Doc A/73/10. See conclusion 10, commentary [8] together with conclusion 5, commentary [5].\n³⁵ Indeed, a similar structural practicality makes international lawyers return to the list of sources in art. 38 of the ICJ Statute when making constructing legal arguments. See, e.g., Martti Koskenniemi, Sources of International Law (Ashgate, 2000), xv, arguing that\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\nis, this function would be undermined by an acceptance of silence of unacknowledged acts to be interpreted as acquiescence.\n\nThis being said, silence regarding a highly debated act which is not in accordance with accepted interpretations of the law may be an indication that a certain rule is losing support in its current form. Identifying the normative force of a rule is weakening, however, not the same as saying that states are directly agreeing to an alteration of said rule.\n\n## 5.2.2.2 Public Debate and Interpretation of the Charter Rules\n\nThe second set of questions to be discussed moves away from the focus on states and instead regard the way in which public debate surrounding unacknowledged acts may affect the development of the law. This is of particular importance in areas where there is yet to be any qualified state practice, such as the definition of cyberattacks as 'force' or 'armed attacks', where experts, including international lawyers, have taken a leading role in finding definitions. Thus, the question here is the possibility of expanding the role of such actors within the development of international law.\n\nWhile a debate on the lawfulness of a response to an attack will have to be guided by a secured attribution for an initial attack, the same may not be needed in order to update our understanding of the definition of concepts in light of novel developments. Thus, it might be possible that events may have influence on the interpretation of, for example, the definition of 'force' in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter even where states remain silent. This is particularly well illustrated in the debates regarding the application of jus ad bellum to cyberattacks.\n\n## 5.3 Illustration: Cyberattacks\n\nThe increased use of cyberattacks, also referred to as 'computer network attacks', has not only affected the security strategies of numerous states, but has also led to debates as to whether and how such attacks should be incorporated into jus ad bellum. Through their anonymous and often indirect nature, cyberattacks raise complex questions regarding attribution and the definition of 'force', which have been explored in numerous\n\n[i]n the context of legal practice, sources are handed down by the very tradition that constitutes what it means to be an 'international lawyer'. The nucleus of the professional consensus is that materials referred to in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute constitute the places in which the law, for practical purposes, should be looked at.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nscholarly works.³⁶ Considering the possibility of anonymity of cyberattacks, the understanding of such attacks as force for the purpose of Article 2(4) will likely develop through verbal state practice and discourse around unacknowledged practice, rather than through overt physical state practice and public justifications by states.³⁷ Indeed, as discussed shortly, covert cyber operations, in particular, the attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010, have been important focal points in the debates regarding cyberattacks as force.³⁸\n\nDespite being held as one of the major security threats of our time, thus far, there is yet to be an acknowledged cyberattack being discussed in relation to the use of force. The lack of public state practice or debate amongst states around reported attacks, however, does not stop the need to update our understanding of ‘force’ and ‘armed attack’ in light of new technology. Rather it means that overt state practice will be of little assistance in this task, and that debates instead will have to be informed by analogy from other areas, as well as through reasoning about how states can and will understand cyberattacks within the law on the use of force.\n\nThe problem of the secrecy surrounding cyberattacks is not something that is likely to diminish; indeed both secrecy and anonymity are held to be core parts of cyberattacks.³⁹ At the same time, in cases where\n\n³⁶ See, especially, Marco Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014); Harrison Dinniss, n 8; Michael N Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Michael N Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual* 2.0, n 1.\n\n³⁷ Though see Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany, ‘A Rule Book on the Shelf?

The perpetrators of cyber attacks may try to keep their responsibility and methods secret.

    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\ncyberattacks are so severe as to (arguably) amount to a use of force, they are likely to have at least some level of external publicity, and it is not impossible that an attacked state will react in an overt manner, in particular, if the damage is already publicly known, and the state is able to identify the responsible actor.⁴⁰\n\nEven though states have largely remained silent regarding conducted cyberattacks, it is clear that states take the threat from such attacks seriously.⁴¹ While it is still unclear exactly under what circumstances states consider cyberattacks to be regulated by the Charter rules, there seems to be wide agreement amongst states that existing law on the use of force shall apply to such attacks, and that they have the possibility to reach the threshold of armed force and armed attack.⁴²\n\n## 5.3.1 Cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran\n\nDespite the difficulties in identifying any claims or legally relevant reactions around them, there is no doubt that the cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 and Iran in 2010 have triggered interesting legal debate on increasingly important issues of *jus ad bellum*.⁴³ Although states have been\n\nvery existence of cyber attacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.\n\nMatthew C Waxman, ‘Self-Defensive Force against Cyber Attacks: Legal, Strategic and Political Dimensions’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 109, 119.\n\n⁴⁰ The ‘publicly known’ aspect of this is of importance as states would rarely wish to acknowledge weaknesses in their cyber defence.\n\n⁴¹ For example, NATO has held numerous discussions about cyber security, and its members have stated readiness to pledge mutual defence in response to a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, which illustrates further the importance of finding a definition for such attacks.

Allegedly conducted by one or more non-state actors operating on behalf of Russia, the attacks were a series of denial of service attacks spread over three weeks, targeting the websites of the Estonian parliament, companies, banks, and government ministries.⁴⁴ There was also spamming of newspaper sites and defacement of the website of the Estonia Reform Party. The attacks followed a dispute between Russia and Estonia over the latter's removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, and Russia was immediately suspected of being behind the attacks.⁴⁵ Russia, however, denied responsibility and has not been directly accused by other states.⁴⁶ The attacks on Estonia were the first set of cyberattacks to spark significant debate amongst international legal academics and security experts and were also held by the foreign minister of Estonia to be ‘the first time that a botnet threatened the national security of an entire nation’.⁴⁷\n\nAlthough sparking much discussion in NATO and beyond, and indeed leading to the first NATO Policy on Cyber Defense in January 2008,⁴⁸ there was little discussion amongst other states regarding whether the attacks on Estonia could be defined as ‘force’ or ‘armed attacks’.⁴⁹ One exception is a statement by then British Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Nick Harvey, in 2012, who stated that cyberattacks may trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.⁵⁰ When prompted by a reporter,\n\n⁴⁴ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *The Guardian* (online), 17 May 2007, available at www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/17/topstories3.russia.\n\n⁴⁵ Ibid.\n\n⁴⁶ ‘Estonia Hit by “Moscow Cyber War”’ *BBC News*, 17 May 2007, available at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6665145.stm.\n\n⁴⁷ Joshua Davies, ‘Hackers Take Down the Most Wired Country in Europe’, *WIRED* (online), 21 August 2007, available at http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia?currentPage=all.\n\n⁴⁸ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that this followed directly from the attacks on Estonia, see NATO, *Cyber Security*, available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm.\n\n⁴⁹ In a press briefing with NATO spokesman James Appathurai, he notably explicitly avoided answering questions regarding the possibility of invoking art. 5 on the attacks on Estonia.

Widely held to have constituted a use of force,⁵² Stuxnet has played an important part in the debates leading towards definitions of cyberattacks as ‘force’ and ‘armed attacks’, and has also triggered important debates as to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks.⁵³ The basic facts are well known. Between 2006 and 2010, the United States and Israel (allegedly) targeted Iran’s nuclear weapons program through ‘Operation Olympic Games’, famously using the computer malware Stuxnet.⁵⁴ Stuxnet is said to have caused damage to the centrifuges engaged in the enhancement of uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and to have thwarted the progress of the uranium enrichment program for several months.⁵⁵ Stuxnet was constructed and used in a way that created the illusion that the problems were caused by the Iranians themselves, making them question their own progress and competence.⁵⁶\n\n[t]he Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\n⁵¹ ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, The Seattle Times (online), 17 May 2012, available at www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uk-minister-cyberattack-could-prompt-nato-action.\n\n⁵² See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342.

Sanger clarifies that, while there seems to be at least some degree of certainty that Stuxnet was part of a joint operation by Israel and the United States, neither of the states has commented on it. However, some details of the operation were leaked by a US official in 2012, and media reports following these leaks have supported the view that the United States and Israel were responsible for launching the attack.\n\n⁵⁵ Ibid.\n\n⁵⁶ Thomas E Ricks, ‘Covert Wars, Waged Virally: “Confront and Conceal,” by David Sanger’, The New York Times (online), 5 June 2012, available at www.nytimes.com/\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nThere are remaining uncertainties as to the damage actually done by the virus. When the virus was first detected in 2010, Iran was unwilling to at all acknowledge that their nuclear power plants had been affected by an intruder, instead stating that the damage had been limited to staff computer and internet providers.⁵⁷ However, on 29 November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that enemies of Iran had ‘succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts’.⁵⁸ While some hold that Iran sought to downplay the damage, others have argued the complete opposite; that Iran decided to instead overstate the effects of Stuxnet in order for its ‘enemies’ to belittle the state of its nuclear capabilities.⁵⁹ Regardless of these uncertainties, it is clear that even though the operation was ongoing for some time, it did little damage if compared to imagined attacks striking out energy or water supply. Still, the scholarly debate following Stuxnet demonstrates wide agreement that the attack reached the threshold for ‘force’ as it directly targeted the security of a state through its nuclear facilities.⁶⁰\n\nThe Stuxnet virus seems to have been part of a wider violent attempt to thwart Iranian nuclear development. One of the directors of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility was killed in a car bomb in January 2012, and there were a number of targeted killings of nuclear scientists in Iran in 2010.⁶¹ In January 2010, a bomb explosion killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran, and later the same year, a quantum physicist was\n\n2012/06/06/books/confront-and-conceal-by-david-sanger.html, stating that ‘[t]he key to getting inside the computers – which were not connected to the Internet – was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there’.\n\n⁵⁷ Iran’s state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted project manager Mahmoud Jahfari as stating that ‘[t]he main systems of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have not been damaged . . .

The attack will here be measured on the severity and the directness of the harm when assessing whether it was an act of force under *jus ad bellum*. For example, in September 2012, then United States legal advisor Harold Koh stated that ‘if the physical consequences of a cyber attack work the kind of physical damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber attack should equally be considered a use of force’.67 This version of the effect based approach with its strong focus on destruction has been criticised for not taking into account ‘the dependency of modern societies on computers, computer systems, and networks’, which allows for non-destructive attacks to create significant damage’.68 In order to address this, the approach has been expanded by international legal scholars, most notably Michael Schmitt, whose early consequence based definition remains highly influential’.69 Explicitly building upon the Schmitt criteria, the Tallinn Manual states that ‘[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.70 It further sets out the factors of severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality.71\n\n66 Duncan B Hollis, ‘Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations’ (2007) 11 Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review 1023, 1041.

Another way of addressing the shortcomings of too strong a focus on destruction rejects the existence of a clear line between instrument based and effect based approaches and instead suggests determining the use of force by the instrument, while determining the instrument based on its effects. See Roscini, n 36, arguing that: ‘weapons are identified by their effects . . . armed force . . . could be defined as the form of intervention . . . that involves the use of instruments (weapons) capable of producing violent consequences’: at 50. Roscini notably argues this with reference to the ICJ’s interpretation of support of armed groups as force.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\nAs discussed shortly, this more nuanced version of the effect based approach is more in line with the approach that has been taken in the verbal practice of states.\n\nTo agree upon a methodological approach is only one part of the quest; even where there is agreement on the methodology, there is still the challenge of assessing whether the attack is of such gravity that it falls within the UN Charter rules on the use of force. If there is some diversity of opinions as to whether or not there is a de minimis threshold for the application of Article 2(4) regarding the use of kinetic weapons,72 this is even more the case with regard to cyberattacks. Verbal state practice suggests that the determining factor is whether or not an attack damages ‘National Critical Infrastructure’ (NCI).73 This verbal practice, if accepted as authoritative,74 provides certain guidance, but it still needs to be deliberated upon in more detail.\n\nAs mentioned, state practice in response to actual attacks is thus far of little help. In relation to Estonia, it would be very difficult to argue that any state has made a claim as to the definition of the attacks as ‘force’ or an ‘armed attack’. Since Estonia decided not to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, or to address the UN Security Council, the statement from the Estonian Foreign Minister that he ‘considered’ invoking Article 5 of the NATO agreement is not a particularly strong pointer, even if it indicates that Estonia at the very least considered the attacks to qualify as a use of force. Similarly, the aforementioned statement by Nick Harvey that the attacks against Estonia ‘potentially’ could have triggered Article 5 of the NATO agreement, is also not a very strong indicator as to the United Kingdom’s interpretation of cyberattacks as force.75 Still, as\n\n72 See discussion in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.\n\n73 The definition of a cyberattack as force is complicated by the lack of a common agreement as to what constitute NCI. Indeed the UN General Assembly has stressed that this is something to be determined independently by states, see, e.g., Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructures, GA Res 58/99, UN Doc A/RES/58/199 (30 January 2004). A helpful overview of state practice by Roscini, n 36, 55–60, shows that it is, however, possible to point out some commonalities between states: it is clear that NCI is focused on national security, and that this includes security on the societal, governmental, and individual level, such as ‘banking and finance, government, communications, emergency and rescue services, public health, transportation, food and water supply and energy’: at 58.\n\n74 For different views on this compare Roscini, n 36 and Harrison Dinniss, n 8, with the former accepting such practice as relevant and the latter significantly downplaying the value of verbal statements not produced in response to a public physical act.\n\n75 ‘UK Minister: Cyberattack Could Prompt NATO Action’, n 51.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\ndiscussed shortly, even though the attacks did not lead to much (open) discussion amongst states, they did, however, spark debate amongst academics.76\n\nThe most prominent document to be produced thus far which considers cyberattacks as ‘force’ is the Tallinn Manual, first published in 2013, with an updated version published in 2017.77 The manual seeks to define ‘force’ by considering how states would be likely to assess potential attacks.78 This is, of course, no easy task when states are staying silent about both their own and other states’ cyberattacks. In an attempt to overcome this, the Tallinn Manual uses the cyberattacks in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), and Iran (2010) as focal points in its analysis. Although this is different from holding the acts to constitute state practice that is directly relevant for the purpose of developing international law, it still shows the importance of reporting such incidents so that they, in turn, can influence legal debate. At the same time, the (arguably) significant position of the Tallinn Manual also illustrates perils with the covertness of cyberattacks relating to the concentration of power by certain states. The manual was clear from the outset about its aim to fill a gap in international law in response to new technology, yet it is not a global project, but one taken within the realms of NATO.79 Although at least partially remedied in the process leading up to the 2017 publication of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the nature of the project does raise, and has raised, significant questions as to the effects that it has on the development of the law on the use of force, as it has excluded experts from many other states.80\n\nIn addition to the Tallinn Manual, there have also been a number of scholarly symposiums and writings discussing the application of existing rules on the use of force to cyber operations, and many of them use reported attacks as examples, even though it is uncertain who conducted\n\n76 See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, 577.\n77 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1; Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1.\n78 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 333–7.\n79 Schmitt and NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, n 1, 1–11.\n80 See, e.g., Yaroslav Radziwill, Cyber-Attacks and the Exploitable Imperfection of International Law (Brill Nijhoff, 2015) 8–9; Kristen E Eichensehr, ‘Book Review: Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare’ (2014) 108 American Journal of International Law 585, 585.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\nthe attacks and why.⁸¹ From the literature, it is clear that if the attacks against Estonia ‘arguably’ reached the threshold for the use of force,⁸² Stuxnet has been described as a clear example of a use of force, with some experts suggesting that it reached the threshold for an ‘armed attack’.⁸³ Further, the attacks on Estonia and Iran have been used as illustrations in the debate over which approach to use when defining cyberattacks as force.⁸⁴ For example, the ‘instrumentalist’ approach to the definition of force has lost ground post the attacks, as both operations illustrate the very real possibilities of physical damage by cyber weapons, thus increasing the popularity of both the ‘target based’ and the ‘effect based’ approaches. The attacks have in this way had great influence on the way in which we debate and understand cyberattacks as force.\n\n## 5.3.3 Attribution of Responsibility for Cyberattacks\n\nOne of the main issues when assessing the (il)legality of cyberattacks is that of attribution. Not only is it difficult to establish the source of an attack, but cyberattacks are often conducted by non-state actors, possibly acting on behalf of a state. There are two separate avenues when assessing whether a link between a state and a non-state actor conducting forceful acts is strong enough for the state’s involvement to constitute a breach of the prohibition on the use of force. The first is to assess whether the acts\n\n⁸¹ See, e.g., Goldsmith, n 43; Dino Kritsiotis, ‘Enforced Equations’ (2013) 24 European Journal of International Law 139; Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43; Hollis, n 66; Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogizing Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2008) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 191.\n\n⁸² See, e.g., Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and Jus ad Bellum Revisited’, n 43, arguing that if the series of attacks on Estonia in 2007 are assessed as one single operation, this would ‘arguably’ reach the threshold for use of force under art. 2(4). He further states that ‘[t]he case of the Estonian cyber attacks can be used to illustrate application of [Schmitt’s] approach [to identifying cyber attacks as force]. Although they caused no deaths, injury, or physical damage, the attacks fundamentally affected the operation of the entire Estonian society’: at 577.\n\n⁸³ See, e.g., Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 342; Harrison Dinniss, n 8. Others have been ‘inclined to see Stuxnet as a use of force, but not necessarily one that, as used, violated the laws of war’: Duncan Hollis, ‘Could Deploying Stuxnet Be a War Crime?’ on opinio juris (25 January 2011), available at http://opiniojuris.org/2011/01/25/could-deploying-stuxnet-be-a-war-crime.\n\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Michael J Glennon, ‘The Road Ahead: Gaps, Drips and Leaks’ (2013) 89 International Law Studies 362.

The ‘effective control’ test as invented and applied in by the ICJ in Nicaragua⁸⁸ and again in the Genocide Case⁸⁹, and the ‘overall control’ test, as invented and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Tadic.⁹⁰ Regardless of which avenue or test is preferred, the attribution will become difficult to establish where an acknowledgement is absent.\n\nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, a state bears responsibility for the acts of its organs, including its intelligence agencies.⁹¹ The responsibility\n\n⁸⁵ See, e.g., ILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc A/RES/56/83 (28 January 2002, adopted 12 December 2001) annex, stating that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct’: at art. 8 (‘Draft Articles on State Responsibility’).\n\n⁸⁶ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.

    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\nalso includes private contractors who are empowered by a state to ‘exercise elements of governmental authority’.⁹² With regard to the attribution of cyberattacks by non-state actors, it is not yet certain what level of control a state should exercise over a non-state actor in order for its cyberattacks to be attributable to the state. The ‘overall control’ test and ‘effective control’ test are tailored to suit responsibility for the acts of organised groups, making them insufficient in the cyber context where attacks can be committed by more unorganised groups, and even by individuals. The Tallinn Manual, therefore, suggests that a state needs to have issued specific instructions or directed or controlled a particular operation to engage state responsibility.⁹³ That such influence has been exercised can, of course, be difficult to prove. The attribution of cyberattacks is particularly difficult as it can be challenging not only to find the particular actor, but also to identify with certainty from which state it is operating.⁹⁴\n\nThe issue of attribution of cyberattacks is of particular significance considering the potential for such attacks to be considered ‘armed attacks’. The importance of setting high evidence thresholds for ‘armed attacks’ cannot be overstated, as a classification of an act as an armed attack creates a right for the target state to use proportionate force in self-defence.⁹⁵ First of all, it should be noted again that the burden of proof lies with the state exercising its right to self-defence. While there is nothing suggesting that attribution is dependent upon a state’s acknowledgement of its involvement, a lack of acknowledgement can lead to significant difficulties when it comes to providing evidence. If there is no sufficient evidence that the state in question was involved in the attack, a use of force against that state would be an unlawful use of force in itself, and a loosening of the evidence requirement would increase the risk of attacks in self-defence being committed against the wrong state (or non-state actor).⁹⁶\n\n⁹² Ibid.\n⁹³ Ibid., 94, rule 17.\n⁹⁴ Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0, n 1, 83. See also Roscini, n 36.\n⁹⁵ See Section 5.3.4.4.\n⁹⁶ An alternative suggestion is to reverse the burden of proof, but this has been rejected both by scholars and the ICJ. See, e.g., Roscini, n 36. Drawing upon the Court’s reasoning in the Genocide and Corfu Channel cases, Roscini argues that ‘the fact that evidence is contained in classified documents, as is often the case in the cyber context, does not result in a reversal of the burden of proof’: at 103.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In *Corfu Channel* the ICJ stated that the required level of certainty might be brought down in situations where it was difficult to obtain information due to knowledge of activities being controlled by the other state.⁹⁷ In such a case, the victim state should be ‘allowed more recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.⁹⁸ Further as discussed in Chapter 3; in situations where states are silent, reports by media and NGOs can be of assistance in this process, even though their materials should be treated with some caution.⁹⁹\n\n## 5.3.4 Cyberattacks and the Right to Self-Defence\n\nCyberattacks raise a number of questions as to the right to self-defence. First of all, it is essential to agree upon under what circumstances cyberattacks constitute ‘armed attacks’. Furthermore, cyberattacks also spark particular questions relating to proportionality and to the intent behind attacks. Moreover, the attack on Stuxnet, together with other attacks against Iran’s nuclear programmes,¹⁰⁰ has been discussed in relation to temporality acts of self-defence in relation to nuclear weapons.¹⁰¹\n\n## 5.3.4.1 Cyberattacks and the Definition of ‘Armed Attack’\n\nThe relationship between ‘the use of force’ and ‘armed attack’, is contested, and beyond the requirement of an armed attack being an unlawful use of force, there are numerous different opinions as to how the term should be defined. Some argue that all intentional breaches of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by states will constitute an armed attack giving rise to a right to self-defence.¹⁰² However, the ICJ has suggested that the concept of an armed attack requires the use of force to be of a certain level of gravity, and\n\n⁹⁷ *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4.\n\n⁹⁸ Ibid.\n\n⁹⁹ Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3.\n\n¹⁰⁰ Including the attack on al-Kibar, as well as other targeted killings of scientists, etc.\n\n¹⁰¹ Christine Gray, ‘Use of Force to Prevent the Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons’ (2009) 2009 Japanese Yearbook of International Law 101; Andrew Garwood-Gowers, ‘Israel’s Airstrike on Syria’s Al-Kibar Facility: A Test Case for the Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence?’ (2011) 16 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 263.\n\n¹⁰² See especially Elisabeth Wilmshurst, ‘Principles of International Law on the Use of Force by States in Self-Defence’ (working paper ILP WP 05/01, Chatham House, Royal Institute for International Affairs, 2005) 6.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In the 2003 Oil Platforms case, the ICJ did not rule out the possibility of the destruction of a vessel constituting an armed attack, thus allowing for a quite inclusive interpretation of the term. $^{105}$ In a similar vein, some writers argue that even though there is a difference between armed attack and less grave uses of force, the threshold for an armed attack is lower than that for an act of aggression. $^{106}$ Further, there is an increasing acceptance of 'cumulative' armed attacks, that is, the possibility that a number of small-scale attacks amount to an armed attack giving a right to self-defence. $^{107}$ This is of particular importance regarding cyberattacks as they often are conducted over some time, as seen with both the attacks against Estonia and Iran.\n\n## 5.3.4.2 Cyberattacks and Temporality\n\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the question of temporality and the potential right to use force in self-defence against imminent threats is one of the most contentious in contemporary debates on jus ad bellum. $^{108}$\n\nIn relation to unacknowledged acts, there has been some discussion about whether Israel has made any claims for a right to use preventive force against the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its attacks on Iran, including the Stuxnet virus and the seemingly related targeted killings. $^{109}$ That these attacks would constitute a claim for non-temporal\n\n$^{103}$ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), UN Doc A/RES/3314 (14 December 1974) annex.\n$^{104}$ Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14; Armed Activities (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168.\n$^{105}$ Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) (Judgment) [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 195 [71] ('Oil Platforms').\n$^{106}$ Tom Ruys, 'Armed Attack' and Article 51 of the UN Charter – Evolutions in Customary Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2010) 139.

    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nunderstanding of imminence, or a setting aside of the imminence requirement altogether with regard to the right to self-defence, at least against nuclear threats, is, however, not convincing. Although Israel has declined to comment on its involvement in the attacks, Israeli officials have repeatedly provided public comments on their view of their right to defend Israel in quite controversial terms, which has led some to query whether this is an indication of an Israeli neglect of international law where it stands in the way of its security considerations, rather than a novel interpretation of the right to self-defence.^[110]^\n\nIsrael is not the only state allegedly attacking Iran in order to thwart its nuclear progress. Could the United States through its reported involvement in Stuxnet be said to have made a claim for the right to anticipatory self-defence against non-imminent threat with regard to nuclear capabilities? This consideration illustrates again how the publicity requirement would benefit from being clarified as including conduct that is both acknowledged and publicly known.\n\nBeyond the general reasons not to consider unacknowledged conduct as constituting claims discussed previously, there would be numerous further problems with identifying the United States' involvement in Stuxnet as a claim. First of all, there is the uncertainty of the level of involvement, and as to whether or not the United States was responsible for any of the factors that made Stuxnet potentially reach a level of 'force' for the purpose of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Secondly, as the United States has made no announcements as to the legality of the operation, it would be difficult to assert which legal justification it intended. As previously stated, great care shall be taken when asserting legal justifications in situations where the acting state is silent.^[111]^ This said, the United States did speak of the importance of a right to preventive self-defence with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and has since spoken of the possibility of a non-temporal understanding of imminence regarding threat from non-state actors.^[112]^ It would, however, be difficult to make an argument that its involvement in the cyberattacks\n\n^[110]^ See, e.g., Gray, n 101.\n^[111]^ See Chapter 3, Section 3.2.\n^[112]^ See, e.g., FBI Director James Comey's statement regarding the 'imminence' of the threat of the Khorasan Group: 'It's hard to say whether that's tomorrow, three weeks from now or three months from now.

    "5.3 ILLUSTRATION: CYBERATTACKS\n\nagainst Iran would qualify as a claim for such an interpretation considering the problems discussed.\n\n## 5.3.4.3 Cyberattacks and Necessity\n\nCyberattacks also raise questions for the interpretation of imminence and the closely intertwined customary requirement of necessity. Despite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be necessary,¹¹³ the assessment of the necessity criteria is far from clear and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations, in particular as they apply to cyberattacks.\n\nThe necessity requirement stems from the Caroline formula and requires the threat to ‘leav[e] no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’,¹¹⁴ and is thus closely intertwined with the concept of imminence of an armed attack discussed earlier. As previously discussed,¹¹⁵ strict application of the requirement of necessity would rule out the greatest dangers of the growing acceptance of pre-emptive self-defence, as force would only be used as a ‘last resort’; that is, only where there is no possibility to resolve the situation with peaceful means, and it is therefore important to pay close attention to this when debating the legality of operations involving force.\n\nIt should be noted that necessity is not just intertwined with the imminence of the armed attack, but also with the imminence of the response; there is a fine line between an act of self-defence and one of (pure) retaliation. A victim state cannot wait a significant amount of time after an armed attack has occurred to strike back when the threat is not ongoing, as such an attack would be of punitive, rather than defensive nature. In relation to cyberattacks, this is particularly complicated considering that it can be difficult to determine the very beginning and end of a cyberattack, or at the very least the part of the attacks amounting to an ‘armed attack’. This, again, ties back to the discussion about approaches to determining cyberattacks as force and developments in this regard will most likely take the form of debates amongst epistemic communities around unacknowledged, but publicly known, attacks.\n\n¹¹³ See, e.g., Nicaragua (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, 245 [41]; Oil Platforms [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\n## 5.3.4.4 Cyberattacks and Proportionality\n\nDespite wide agreement that a use of force in self-defence must be proportionate,¹¹⁶ the assessment of this criteria is far from clear, and its interpretation can be informed by debates around covert operations. The issue does not just concern the assessment of a threshold, but also a decision about what to measure the proportionality against. According to the vast majority of scholars, the demand for proportionality requires that the use of force does not go beyond what is needed for the threat to be eliminated.¹¹⁷ Such a functional approach has however been challenged by customary practice which also seems to add an element of ‘matching’ the initial attack.¹¹⁸ This matching does not, however, have to be in terms of similar weapons. This is of particular importance when considering proportionality in response to cyberattacks. As there is a lack of state practice to rely upon, the interpretation of this customary principle in relation to cyberattacks has thus far been left to experts. The Tallinn Manual states that in the event that a state would conduct a cyberattack amounting to an armed attack, the victim state would have the right to use both kinetic force and cyberattacks in response.¹¹⁹\n\nThe difficulty of assessing the proportionality requirement in relation to cyber attacks was illustrated by the Stuxnet virus, where, even after the attack had become publicly known, there was still uncertainty as to the actual damage done to Iran’s nuclear programme. Despite this, it is an important part of *jus ad bellum*, the importance of which can be said to be even greater considering the uncertainty around temporality discussed in the previous chapter. One of the dangers of allowing for the preventive use of force in self-defence against potential future attacks without being certain of where the attack is coming from, or what shape it will take, is that this also expands the possibilities as to what can be considered proportionate to eliminate a threat, which leads to the assessment of the proportionality of the response becoming even more speculative. Indeed, adherence to the proportionality requirement can, together with necessity, act as an aid to restrict the potential dangers of preventive, and pre-emptive self-defence. To leave the interpretation of the proportionality\n\n¹¹⁶ See, e.g., *Nicaragua (Judgment)* [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 94 [176]; *Oil Platforms* [2003] ICJ Rep 161, 183 [43], 196–7 [73]–[74], 198 [76].

    "5.4 CYBERATTACKS &amp; DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION\n\nrequirement in relation to cyberattacks entirely to experts is, therefore, problematic and presents a potential danger with state silence in relation to cyberattacks.\n\n## 5.4 Cyberattacks and the Dynamic Interpretation of Jus ad Bellum\n\nIt is clear that the cyberattacks against Estonia and Iran have had great influence on debates around the application of the UN Charter to cyberattacks. Again, to influence the debate is very different from constituting precedents for the development of custom; yet the ideas and arguments put forward in scholarly articles and documents such as the Tallinn Manual around unacknowledged cyberattacks can shape the thinking of governmental lawyers and possibly also states, thus indirectly shaping the development of customary international law. Further, as previously discussed, international legal scholars, and other actors are part of the 'process of interpretation' of the rules on the use of force.¹²⁰ This is not a novel phenomenon; indeed the Tallinn Manual is 'part of a longstanding tradition of legal scholars and practitioners laboring to adapt existing law to new circumstances, opting to extend the law by way of interpretation and analogy'.¹²¹ The aim here is therefore not to evaluate the Manual's value as a 'normative point of reference',¹²² but rather it is to illustrate the role of covert operations in illuminating and creating the 'gap' which the Manual, and other scholarly interventions, seeks to fill.¹²³ It is important to recognise how the role for legal scholars becomes increasingly important and extensive as more and more of the legal discussion involves acts that are covert in whole or in part, where\n\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Ingo Venzke, How Interpretation Makes International Law: On Semantic Change and Normative Twists (Oxford University Press, 2012) 18.\n¹²¹ Efrony and Shany, n 37, 583\n¹²² Ibid.\n¹²³ Interesting and insightful recent writings on scholarship and knowledge production in international law include Jörg Kammerhofer, 'Lawmaking by Scholars' in Catherine Brölmann and Yannick Radi (eds.), Research Handbook on the Theory and Practice of International Lawmaking (Edward Elgar, 2016) 305; Lianne JM Boer, International Law As We Know It: Cyberwar Discourse and the Construction of Knowledge in International Legal Scholarship (PhD dissertation, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2017); Matthew Windsor, 'Narrative Kill or Capture: Unreliable Narration in International Law' (2015) 28 Leiden Journal of International Law 743; Jean d'Aspremont, Epistemic Forces in International Law: Foundational Doctrines and Techniques of International Legal Argumentation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015); Carsten Stahn and Eric De Brabandere, \"The Future of International Legal Scholarship: Some Thoughts on \"Practice\", \"Growth\", and \"Dissemination\" (2014) 27 Leiden Journal of International Law 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "UNACKNOWLEDGED OPERATIONS\n\nreactions to and analyses of reports of acts of force take place before there have been any justifications or reactions presented by states, rather than limiting the role of international legal scholars to evaluating the validity of legal arguments presented by states.\n\nAs discussed by Jean d'Aspremont, the space for ‘interventionism’ by legal scholars is particularly evident in relation to cyberattacks.¹²⁴ As there is disagreement both as to what threshold to use, and through which approach to address this threshold, any incidents that lead to debates providing clarifications on this will likely have significant impact on how cyberattacks will continue to be incorporated into international law on the use of force. Where there is uncertainty as to how to interpret ‘force’ or ‘armed attack’ and there is no relevant practice by states or UN organs on which to turn, it is likely to be the case that scholarly projects discussing unacknowledged attacks will prove to have great influence over the way in which the rules will be interpreted in the future.¹²⁵ As mentioned concerning the Tallinn Manual, however, it is also important to remember that such developments risk centring power on a small and select number of international legal experts.\n\n## 5.5 Conclusion\n\nAs demonstrated, while unacknowledged operations are often not of direct relevance in themselves, debates around them can be of great relevance for the development of international law on the use of force. Any assessment of the value of reactions to unacknowledged acts is connected to the value attributed to verbal and physical state practice and the requirement for debate to be grounded in public physical practice. For states and international lawyers who accept verbal statements as relevant for legal development (as most do), covert operations may serve\n\n¹²⁴ Jean d'Aspremont, ‘Cyber Operations and International Law: An Interventionist Legal Thought’ (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 575. See also Pål Wrange, ‘Intervention in National and Private Cyberspace and International Law’ in Jonas Ebbesson et al. (eds.), International Law and Changing Perceptions of Security (Brill Nijhoff, 2014) 307, stressing the urgency of clarifying what ‘terms like “use of force” … mean in cyberspace’ and further arguing that ‘[i]n that process, commentators on international law should play an important role’: at 326.\n\n¹²⁵ See, e.g., Alexandra Perina on the value of the Tallinn Manual, stating that: ‘In the absence of comparably detailed State articulations of the law, it is likely to be the resource of first resort in its field to practitioners and scholars alike’: Alexandra H Perina, ‘Black Holes and Open Secrets: The Impact of Covert Action on International Law’ (2015) 53 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 507, 582.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "5.5 CONCLUSION\n\nas a trigger for such practice, as well as for expressions of how reacting states understand the operations in relation to international law. At the same time, state silence in response to reports of unacknowledged conduct should not be interpreted as acquiescence, as states generally will not be of the understanding that such conduct is in a position to alter the law.\n\nDespite problems with finding ‘a’ scholarly interpretation of a certain concept or rule, or deciding which of the offered interpretations to adopt, scholarship still assists in the interpretation of the Charter rules and affects the way in which states will address related issues in the future. This is especially so for areas where states remain completely silent, and there is a need to update the interpretation of the law in light of novel developments where state practice is lacking.\n\nUnacknowledged operations that are publicly known illustrate the need to move beyond debates of state practice and customary international law when assessing the role that such operations may play in the development of *jus ad bellum*. Whilst, as previously discussed, states and UN organs are the primary interpreters of the UN Charter, numerous other actors participate in this development. Even though the core institutional framework and authorities remain, covert but publicly known conduct opens up more space for some actors, such as legal scholars and other experts to influence the development of the law.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108637671.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
