Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013\nSummary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\n\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\" / Destroying the Galactic Government. / \"Awesome!

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure.³ States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage.⁴ In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.⁵\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state⁶ that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n³ Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n⁴ PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches\nThe prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used.⁹ Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”.¹⁰ Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not.¹¹ However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”.¹² The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.¹³ There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack.¹⁴ According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life.¹⁵ Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n⁹ NGUYEN, Reese.

The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation.²⁴ It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.²⁵\n¹⁶ HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n¹⁷ NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n¹⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁹ Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n²⁰ To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n²¹ HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n²² NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n²³ Ibid.\n²⁴ SCHMITT, N.

For example, Germany takes the position that “[m]alicious cyber operations can constitute an armed attack whenever they are comparable to traditional kinetic armed attack in scale and effect”.²⁷ Similar official statements have been made by Estonia (“[i]n order to assess if a cyber operation reaches the threshold of the use of force or an armed attack ... we must consider the scale and effects”),²⁸ Italy (“wrongful cyber operations ... may constitute an armed attack when their scale and effects are comparable to those resulting from conventional armed attacks”),²⁹ Netherlands (“to determine whether an operation constitutes an armed attack, the scale and effects of the operation must be considered”),³⁰ New Zealand (“[s]tate cyber activity can amount to a use of force ...

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.”³⁷ Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.³⁸\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n33 Ibid, pp. 83–84.\n34 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.

The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure\nThe question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century.³⁹ The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁴⁰ The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945.⁴¹ Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law).⁴² In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n³⁹ FARER, Tom, J.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\".[43] Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".[44]\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\".[45] These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty.[46] In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force\nIn previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent.[47] It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts.[48] In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".[49]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.⁵⁵\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014),⁵⁶ Kilovaty (2015),⁵⁷ Schmitt (2017),⁵⁸ Lotrione (2018)⁵⁹ and Fernicola (2020)⁶⁰ among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia.⁶¹ Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”.⁶² Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n⁵⁵ LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack.[66] Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\".[67] Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\".[68] Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\".[69] Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".[70]\n63 SCHMITT, BILLER: The NotPetya Cyber Operation...\n64 LOTRIONTE: Reconsidering the Consequences..., p. 89.\n65 FERNICOLA: Once Upon a Time in Cyberspace..., p. 81.\n66 France.

This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72\n## 5 Conclusion\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013\nSummary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\n\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\" / Destroying the Galactic Government. / \"Awesome!

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure. States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage. In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches\nThe prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used. Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”. Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not. However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”. The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack. According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life. Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n NGUYEN, Reese. Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare.

This approach has also met with criticism. Consistent application of this approach would lead to a substantial increase in the risk of international conflict, as even a minimal interference with a state's critical infrastructure, even if only of the nature of espionage, could lead the injured state to overreact (use of force in self-defense) with the justification that its critical infrastructure has been interfered with. Such a broad classification of cyber operations as an armed attack is clearly contrary to the fundamental objectives of the United Nations ([t]o maintain international peace and security) and there is no support for it in state practice. This approach should therefore also be rejected as inappropriate and dangerous.\n## 2.3 Effects-based approach\nThis brings us to the third approach, which generally receives the most support in the expert debate and is also strongly supported by state practice. The effects-based (also called consequence-based) approach is based on the idea that neither the weapon (instrument) used nor the type of the target (nature of the target) is crucial for states, but the consequences of a cyber operation are key. The more the consequences of a cyber operation (material damage, loss of life, etc.) resemble those of conventional weapons, the more likely such a cyber operation will be considered a use of force or armed attack. But how to assess these consequences of a cyber operation for the purposes of use of force? The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation. It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.\n HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n Ibid.\n SCHMITT, N.

For example, Germany takes the position that “[m]alicious cyber operations can constitute an armed attack whenever they are comparable to traditional kinetic armed attack in scale and effect”. Similar official statements have been made by Estonia (“[i]n order to assess if a cyber operation reaches the threshold of the use of force or an armed attack ... we must consider the scale and effects”), Italy (“wrongful cyber operations ... may constitute an armed attack when their scale and effects are comparable to those resulting from conventional armed attacks”), Netherlands (“to determine whether an operation constitutes an armed attack, the scale and effects of the operation must be considered”), New Zealand (“[s]tate cyber activity can amount to a use of force ...

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.” Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601</https:>\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nstate the right to defend itself through individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure\nThe question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century. The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945. Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law). In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n FARER, Tom, J. Political and Economic Coercion in Contemporary International Law.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\".[43] Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".[44]\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\".[45] These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty.[46] In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force\nIn previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent.[47] It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts.[48] In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".[49]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014), Kilovaty (2015), Schmitt (2017), Lotrione (2018) and Fernicola (2020) among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia. Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”. Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack.[66] Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\".[67] Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\".[68] Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\".[69] Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".[70]\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nBased on the above, it can be considered that at least some cyber operations that cause serious economic damage without causing material damage may fulfil the characteristics of prohibited use of force within the meaning of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter and even armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which may lead to the use of force in self-defense. This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72\n## 5 Conclusion\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure.³ States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage.⁴ In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.⁵\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state⁶ that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n³ Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n⁴ PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.",
    "## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches": "The prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used.⁹ Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”.¹⁰ Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not.¹¹ However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”.¹² The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.¹³ There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack.¹⁴ According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life.¹⁵ Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n⁹ NGUYEN, Reese.

The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation.²⁴ It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.²⁵\n¹⁶ HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n¹⁷ NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n¹⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁹ Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n²⁰ To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n²¹ HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n²² NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n²³ Ibid.\n²⁴ SCHMITT, N.

For example, Germany takes the position that “[m]alicious cyber operations can constitute an armed attack whenever they are comparable to traditional kinetic armed attack in scale and effect”.²⁷ Similar official statements have been made by Estonia (“[i]n order to assess if a cyber operation reaches the threshold of the use of force or an armed attack ... we must consider the scale and effects”),²⁸ Italy (“wrongful cyber operations ... may constitute an armed attack when their scale and effects are comparable to those resulting from conventional armed attacks”),²⁹ Netherlands (“to determine whether an operation constitutes an armed attack, the scale and effects of the operation must be considered”),³⁰ New Zealand (“[s]tate cyber activity can amount to a use of force ...

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.”³⁷ Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.³⁸\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n33 Ibid, pp. 83–84.\n34 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.

The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.",
    "# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure": "The question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century.³⁹ The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁴⁰ The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945.⁴¹ Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law).⁴² In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n³⁹ FARER, Tom, J.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 208; FARER: Political and Economic Coercion..., p. 410–411.\n⁴¹ FARER: Political and Economic Coercion..., p. 410–411.\n⁴² FARER: Political and Economic Coercion..., p. 410–411; SCHMITT: Tallinn Manual 2.0..., p. 331.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nOn the other hand, this conclusion does not mean that no infliction of economic harm on another state can constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force. Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\". Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\". These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty. In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.",
    "## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force": "In previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent. It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts. In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.⁵⁵\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014),⁵⁶ Kilovaty (2015),⁵⁷ Schmitt (2017),⁵⁸ Lotrione (2018)⁵⁹ and Fernicola (2020)⁶⁰ among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia.⁶¹ Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”.⁶² Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n⁵⁵ LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack. Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\". Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\". Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\". Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".\n63 SCHMITT, BILLER: The NotPetya Cyber Operation...\n64 LOTRIONTE: Reconsidering the Consequences..., p. 89.\n65 FERNICOLA: Once Upon a Time in Cyberspace..., p. 81.\n66 France.

This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72",
    "## 5 Conclusion": "The main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013\nSummary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\n\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\" / Destroying the Galactic Government. / \"Awesome! Are you going to set up their nukes to target each other? Or reprogram their military portal to disintegrate their entire space fleet?\" / Good pitches kids. I am almost proud of you. But watch closely as grandpa topples an empire by changing 1 to a 0.\"\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601</https:>\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThis discussion occurred in an episode of the popular American TV series Rick and Morty. It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure. States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage. In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches\nThe prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used. Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”. Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not. However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”. The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack. According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life. Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n NGUYEN, Reese. Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare.

This approach has also met with criticism. Consistent application of this approach would lead to a substantial increase in the risk of international conflict, as even a minimal interference with a state's critical infrastructure, even if only of the nature of espionage, could lead the injured state to overreact (use of force in self-defense) with the justification that its critical infrastructure has been interfered with. Such a broad classification of cyber operations as an armed attack is clearly contrary to the fundamental objectives of the United Nations ([t]o maintain international peace and security) and there is no support for it in state practice. This approach should therefore also be rejected as inappropriate and dangerous.\n## 2.3 Effects-based approach\nThis brings us to the third approach, which generally receives the most support in the expert debate and is also strongly supported by state practice. The effects-based (also called consequence-based) approach is based on the idea that neither the weapon (instrument) used nor the type of the target (nature of the target) is crucial for states, but the consequences of a cyber operation are key. The more the consequences of a cyber operation (material damage, loss of life, etc.) resemble those of conventional weapons, the more likely such a cyber operation will be considered a use of force or armed attack. But how to assess these consequences of a cyber operation for the purposes of use of force? The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation. It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.\n HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n Ibid.\n SCHMITT, N.

For example, Germany takes the position that “[m]alicious cyber operations can constitute an armed attack whenever they are comparable to traditional kinetic armed attack in scale and effect”. Similar official statements have been made by Estonia (“[i]n order to assess if a cyber operation reaches the threshold of the use of force or an armed attack ... we must consider the scale and effects”), Italy (“wrongful cyber operations ... may constitute an armed attack when their scale and effects are comparable to those resulting from conventional armed attacks”), Netherlands (“to determine whether an operation constitutes an armed attack, the scale and effects of the operation must be considered”), New Zealand (“[s]tate cyber activity can amount to a use of force ...

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.” Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601</https:>\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nstate the right to defend itself through individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure\nThe question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century. The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945. Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law). In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n FARER, Tom, J. Political and Economic Coercion in Contemporary International Law.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\".[43] Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".[44]\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\".[45] These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty.[46] In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force\nIn previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent.[47] It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts.[48] In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".[49]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014), Kilovaty (2015), Schmitt (2017), Lotrione (2018) and Fernicola (2020) among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia. Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”. Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack.[66] Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\".[67] Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\".[68] Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\".[69] Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".[70]\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nBased on the above, it can be considered that at least some cyber operations that cause serious economic damage without causing material damage may fulfil the characteristics of prohibited use of force within the meaning of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter and even armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which may lead to the use of force in self-defense. This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72\n## 5 Conclusion\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013\nSummary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\n\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\" / Destroying the Galactic Government. / \"Awesome!

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure. States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage. In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches\nThe prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used. Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”. Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not. However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”. The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack. According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life. Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n NGUYEN, Reese. Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare.

This approach has also met with criticism. Consistent application of this approach would lead to a substantial increase in the risk of international conflict, as even a minimal interference with a state's critical infrastructure, even if only of the nature of espionage, could lead the injured state to overreact (use of force in self-defense) with the justification that its critical infrastructure has been interfered with. Such a broad classification of cyber operations as an armed attack is clearly contrary to the fundamental objectives of the United Nations ([t]o maintain international peace and security) and there is no support for it in state practice. This approach should therefore also be rejected as inappropriate and dangerous.\n## 2.3 Effects-based approach\nThis brings us to the third approach, which generally receives the most support in the expert debate and is also strongly supported by state practice. The effects-based (also called consequence-based) approach is based on the idea that neither the weapon (instrument) used nor the type of the target (nature of the target) is crucial for states, but the consequences of a cyber operation are key. The more the consequences of a cyber operation (material damage, loss of life, etc.) resemble those of conventional weapons, the more likely such a cyber operation will be considered a use of force or armed attack. But how to assess these consequences of a cyber operation for the purposes of use of force? The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation. It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.\n HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n Ibid.\n Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n Ibid.\n SCHMITT, N.

For example, Germany takes the position that “[m]alicious cyber operations can constitute an armed attack whenever they are comparable to traditional kinetic armed attack in scale and effect”. Similar official statements have been made by Estonia (“[i]n order to assess if a cyber operation reaches the threshold of the use of force or an armed attack ... we must consider the scale and effects”), Italy (“wrongful cyber operations ... may constitute an armed attack when their scale and effects are comparable to those resulting from conventional armed attacks”), Netherlands (“to determine whether an operation constitutes an armed attack, the scale and effects of the operation must be considered”), New Zealand (“[s]tate cyber activity can amount to a use of force ...

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.” Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601</https:>\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nstate the right to defend itself through individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure\nThe question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century. The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945. Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law). In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n FARER, Tom, J. Political and Economic Coercion in Contemporary International Law.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\".[43] Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".[44]\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\".[45] These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty.[46] In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force\nIn previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent.[47] It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts.[48] In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".[49]\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014), Kilovaty (2015), Schmitt (2017), Lotrione (2018) and Fernicola (2020) among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia. Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”. Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack.[66] Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\".[67] Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\".[68] Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\".[69] Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".[70]\n\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nBased on the above, it can be considered that at least some cyber operations that cause serious economic damage without causing material damage may fulfil the characteristics of prohibited use of force within the meaning of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter and even armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which may lead to the use of force in self-defense. This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72\n## 5 Conclusion\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013\nSummary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\n\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\" / Destroying the Galactic Government. / \"Awesome!

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure.³ States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage.⁴ In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.⁵\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state⁶ that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n³ Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n⁴ PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches\nThe prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach\nAs the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used.⁹ Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”.¹⁰ Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not.¹¹ However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”.¹² The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.¹³ There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack.¹⁴ According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life.¹⁵ Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack\n⁹ NGUYEN, Reese.

The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation.²⁴ It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.²⁵\n¹⁶ HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n¹⁷ NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n¹⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁹ Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n²⁰ To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n²¹ HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n²² NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n²³ Ibid.\n²⁴ SCHMITT, N.

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.”³⁷ Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.³⁸\nReturning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a \"force\" at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked\n33 Ibid, pp. 83–84.\n34 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.

The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure\nThe question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century.³⁹ The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of \"force\" within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁴⁰ The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945.⁴¹ Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law).⁴² In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n³⁹ FARER, Tom, J.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as \"aggression\" if the aim of the coercion was \"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\". Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that \"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".\nBut is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as \"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\". These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty. In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two \"methods\" of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force\nIn previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent. It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts. In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts \"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, $^{50}$  EU, $^{51}$  Canada, $^{52}$  China $^{53}$  and Russia $^{54}$  among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.⁵⁵\nThe conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014),⁵⁶ Kilovaty (2015),⁵⁷ Schmitt (2017),⁵⁸ Lotrione (2018)⁵⁹ and Fernicola (2020)⁶⁰ among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia.⁶¹ Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”.⁶² Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as\n⁵⁵ LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing \"economic damage\" is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack. Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a \"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\". Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that \"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\" and that \"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\". Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the \"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\". Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it \"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend ... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".\n63 SCHMITT, BILLER: The NotPetya Cyber Operation...\n64 LOTRIONTE: Reconsidering the Consequences..., p. 89.\n65 FERNICOLA: Once Upon a Time in Cyberspace..., p. 81.\n66 France.

This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72\n## 5 Conclusion\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references\nCanada.

Cyber Operations against Critical Financial Infrastructure: a Non-Destructive Armed Attack? International and Comparative Law Review, 2022, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 27–42. DOI: 10.2478/iclr-2022-0013 Summary: The article is devoted to the issue of the use of force in self-defense against cyber operations aimed at financial and banking infrastructure that cause only economic (non-material) damage. The article deals with the relationship between the described type of cyber operation and economic coercion, presenting the conclusion that these are different acts, which are subject to a different regime of international law regulation. Attention is also paid to the analytical approaches that can be used to bring cyber operations under the regime of the regulation of the use of force. The main contribution of the article is to capture the evolution of the scholarly debate and state practice in relation to non-destructive cyber operations in the period after the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0 (post-2017), concluding that even non-destructive cyber operations (including cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure) can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack, based on newly available sources, in particular official national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace published by states.\nKeywords: article 51 UN Charter, self-defense, use of force, armed attack, cyber operations, cyber-attacks, critical infrastructure, financial and banking system, non-material damage.\n# 1 Introduction\"So, what are you doing with level 9 access, anyway?\"/ Destroying the Galactic Government. /\"Awesome!

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure.³ States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage.⁴ In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.⁵ States are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state⁶ that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra- ³ Critical infrastructure can be defined as:\"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\"See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n⁴ PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n## 2 Cyber operation as a use of force: analytical approaches The prohibition of the threat and the use of force in international relations is enshrined in Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945 and its authors could not have foreseen that in the future a worldwide computer network would be created through which it would be possible to destroy critical infrastructure on the other side of the world without firing a single shot. It is therefore necessary to deal at least briefly with the question of how the legal framework of the UN Charter and the regulation of the use of force can be applied to cyber operations.\nA cyber operation does not have the characteristics of a classic conventional attack, yet its consequences may be comparable or even more severe.7 Can cyber operations therefore fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack? The short answer is yes. Three approaches have been proposed in the scholarly debate to determine whether a cyber operation constitutes a prohibited use of force. These are the instrument-based approach, the target-based approach and the effects-based approach.8 The following section of the article will be devoted Published by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601 ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nto a brief explanation of them, as the choice of the correct analytical approach is a prerequisite for properly answering the research question posed above.\n## 2.1 Instrument-based approach As the name suggests, under the instrument-based approach, the main criterion for determining whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of a use of force is the type of weapon used.⁹ Nguyen aptly states, “The more analogous a new weapon is to conventional forms of military force, the more likely its operation will constitute a ‘use of force’ or ‘armed attack’”.¹⁰ Cyber operations are far removed in nature from conventional weapons. Instead of missiles and bullets, computer code is in the lead. Instead of physical interaction at the point of conflict, a cyber operation can be conducted over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers. Thus, applying the instrument-based approach as a method for determining whether a cyber operation fulfills the characteristics of a use of force will always lead to the conclusion that it does not.¹¹ However, this approach does not reflect the realities of 21st century conflict and has therefore been subjected to considerable criticism and labelled “rigid and inflexible” and “outdated”.¹² The fact is that the application of this concept would lead to absurd conclusions, for example, that the destruction of critical infrastructure (electricity grid, healthcare system, water distribution, etc.) through a cyber operation, despite its fatal consequences, could not be considered a use of force or an armed attack, leaving the attacked state without the ability to defend itself in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.¹³ There is therefore no choice but to reject this approach in accordance with the overwhelming majority of the expert community.\n## 2.2 Target-based approach On the opposite side of the spectrum from the instrument-based approach lies the target-based approach. According to this approach, any cyber operation targeting a “sufficiently important computer system” should be considered an armed attack.¹⁴ According to Sharp, one of the main proponents of this approach, any cyber operation against a state’s critical infrastructure should be considered an armed attack, regardless of whether it results in material damage or loss of life.¹⁵ Thus, the main criterion for determining the existence of an armed attack ⁹ NGUYEN, Reese.

The best known is the framework proposed by Michael Schmitt back in 1999, which is based on six factors: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy of the cyber operation.²⁴ It should be noted, however, that these criteria are increasingly being questioned, as their application is very subjective and depends on the individual (state) to conclude that a particular cyber operation is or is not an armed attack, and often both conclusions will be possible.²⁵ ¹⁶ HANDLER: The New Cyber Face of Battle..., p. 227.\n¹⁷ NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1120–1121.\n¹⁸ Ibid.\n¹⁹ Charter of the United Nations, art. 1 (1).\n²⁰ To date, no state has responded to any cyber operation with the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n²¹ HATHAWAY: The Law of Cyber-Attack... p. 847.\n²² NGUYEN: Navigating Jus Ad Bellum..., pp. 1121–1122.\n²³ Ibid.\n²⁴ SCHMITT, N.

The discussion can be concluded for now by referring to the interpretation presented in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the most sophisticated publication on the application of international law in cyberspace), where all the experts preparing the manual agreed that “the mere fact that a computer (rather than a more traditional weapon, weapon system, or platform) is used during an operation has no bearing on whether that operation amounts to a ‘use of force’ (...). In the cyber context, it is not the instrument used that determines whether the use of force threshold has been crossed, but rather, (...) the consequences of the operation and its surrounding circumstances.”³⁷ Indeed, also Rule 71 (Self-defence against armed attack) of the Tallinn Manual explicitly states that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects”.³⁸ Returning to the main research question of this article, we can state the following. If one were to view cyber operations through the lens of the instrument-based approach, one would have no choice but to conclude that a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure cannot, under any circumstances, fulfill the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack because it is not a\"force\"at all. On the contrary, if the target-based approach were to be enforced, any cyber operation against critical (financial) infrastructure would be an armed attack, regardless of the consequences, and would therefore give the attacked Published by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601</https:> ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nstate the right to defend itself through individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The article could then end at this point. However, as explained, a third approach, the effects-based (consequence-based) approach, has prevailed over the other two.\nUsing this approach, cyber operations can be divided into two categories – cyber operations that directly cause material damage and cyber operations that do not (non-destructive cyber-operations). The first category is not the subject of this article, so we can only briefly state that cyber-operations that cause material damage similar to a conventional attack (e.g. physical destruction of a power plant), which in the case of a conventional attack would lead to the conclusion of the existence of a use of force (armed attack), can also be considered a use of force (armed attack).\nWe will now focus on the second category of cyber operations, those that do not cause direct material damage. Specifically, we will be interested in operations that directly cause only economic damage. In order to address the question of whether such operations can be considered a use of force or an armed attack, we must first answer the question of whether or not such cyber operations are economic coercion.\n# 3 Economic coercion v. cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure The question of legality of economic coercion and its relationship to art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter (prohibition of the use of force) was extensively discussed in the second half of the 20th century.³⁹ The result of these discussions was a clear rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion under the scope of the concept of\"force\"within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁴⁰ The main argument mentioned in this context is the explicit rejection of the inclusion of economic coercion in the UN Charter at the San Francisco Conference in 1945.⁴¹ Similarly, the practice of states, i.e. the long-standing toleration of economic coercion as a means of enforcing international policy, must lead to the conclusion that economic coercion does not constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force and is a legitimate instrument for the promotion of states' interests (while not excluding that some economic instruments may be found to violate other rules of international law).⁴² In other words, economic pressure does not constitute force under Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n³⁹ FARER, Tom, J.

Tom Farer, a great opponent of the idea that economic coercion could constitute a violation of the prohibition on the use of force, stated as early as 1985 that even he could consider economic coercion as\"aggression\"if the aim of the coercion was\"to liquidate an existing state or to reduce that state to the position of a satellite\".[43] Perhaps Michael Schmitt thinks along similar lines in his seminal article of 1999 when he states that\"the use of force line must lie somewhere between economic coercion and the use of an armed force\".[44] But is a cyber operation that causes only economic damage a form of economic coercion? The arguments seem to support the opposite conclusion. Economic coercion can be defined as\"efforts to project influence across frontiers by denying or conditioning access to a country's resources, raw materials, semi- or finished products, capital, technology, service or consumers\".[45] These are therefore practices which, while causing economic harm to the target country, do not interfere with its sovereignty.[46] In the case of non-destructive cyber operations, however, the situation is quite different. Let us take the example of a cyber operation against the stock exchange in the capital of State A, which results in the collapse of the national economy of State A. If such a cyber operation is carried out on the territory of State A (albeit remotely via a computer system), its sovereignty is infringed. The damage caused here does not arise from the limitation of State A's ability to realise its full economic potential, as would be the case in the case of economic coercion, but is the result of direct damage to data and information systems. Thus, the mechanism of economic damage is quite different in the case of economic coercion than in the case of a cyber operation against the economy of the attacked state, and the only thing that links these two\"methods\"of foreign policy implementation is the fact that only economic damage results.\nIt can therefore be concluded that a cyber operation that results only in economic damage is not economic coercion. Therefore, the argument that such a cyber operation is legal because it is an economic coercion, which is legal per se, or at least does not violate the prohibition on the use of force, cannot be invoked.\n## 4 Cyber operations against critical (financial) infrastructure as a use of force In previous sections of this article, it has been explained that some cyber operations may constitute a prohibited use of force, and the most serious ones may even constitute an armed attack, establishing the right of self-defense of the victim state.\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601 ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nThe evaluation of the fulfilment of the characteristics of an armed attack is carried out on the basis of the effects-based approach, for which the main criterion is the scale and effects of the cyber operation. Thus, cyber operations that cause extensive material damage will generally be considered an armed attack. The question remains as to whether cyber operations that do not cause any immediate material damage or loss of life can also fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack.\nThe conclusions reached by the expert group in the preparation of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 can be a starting point for further discussion. These experts, working between 2015 and 2016, did not reach a consensus on the issue. Some of the experts were of the opinion that material damage or injury to persons is a characteristic and necessary feature of an armed attack. The other part of the group, however, concluded that it is not the nature of the consequence that matters, but its extent.[47] It was the example of a cyber operation against an international stock exchange resulting in a market collapse that created the most significant tension among experts.[48] In that example, only financial losses are incurred, which for some experts is not sufficient to meet the characteristics of an armed attack, while the other part of the experts\"emphasized the catastrophic effects such a crash would occasion and therefore regarded them as sufficient to characterize the operation as an armed attack\".[49] The Tallinn Manual 2.0 was published in 2017, and one has to ask whether this contentious issue has been clarified in the past five years. Recent literature and state practice suggest that it has.\nThe financial and banking sector can be considered part of the critical infrastructure. This is quite clear from the definitions of critical infrastructure published by states. Finance and/or banking include at least the US, EU, Canada, China and Russia among critical infrastructure.\nPublished by Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601 ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nIf we proceed from this conclusion, we can apply the conclusions regarding non-destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure also to cyber operations against financial infrastructure, such as banking information systems or trading exchanges.\nA frequently cited example is the destruction of the stock exchange through bombing and cyber operations. In the first case, it is undoubtedly an armed attack (bombing the territory of another state). In the second case, however, the conclusion is not clear-cut. The only difference between the two operations is that (assuming the bombing is carried out at night and no injuries are caused) the bombing also results in the destruction of buildings (material damage). However, this is certainly not the main objective of such an operation, as both operations are primarily aimed at damaging the economy of the attacked state by putting the stock exchange out of business. Therefore, it is not logical that in one case it is an armed attack and in the other case it is not. In fact, the same conclusion was reached by the author of this hypothetical situation, Herbert Lin, back in 2010.⁵⁵ The conclusion that cyber operations against financial infrastructure can fulfil the characteristics of use of force and armed attack without necessarily causing direct material damage has subsequently been expressed by Roscini (2014),⁵⁶ Kilovaty (2015),⁵⁷ Schmitt (2017),⁵⁸ Lotrione (2018)⁵⁹ and Fernicola (2020)⁶⁰ among others. Roscini built his argument on official statements of the United States as well as Russia.⁶¹ Kilovaty concluded that even though the purely economic harm ensuing from a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure creates a space for disagreement, at least the most “sophisticated and severe” cyber operation of this kind “will be considered armed attacks and invoke the right to self-defense”.⁶² Prof. Michael N. Schmitt, a leading expert in the field, observed the “growing sense that non-destructive cyber operations, such as ⁵⁵ LIN, Herbert. Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force.

France has stated quite clearly that causing\"economic damage\"is fully sufficient for a cyber operation to be considered an armed attack.[66] Italy will consider as an armed attack a cyber operation that leads to a\"disruption of the functioning of critical infrastructure\".[67] Norway has commented on the issue of self-defense against non-destructive cyber operations that\"use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilization, may amount to the use of force\"and that\"[a] cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack\".[68] Singapore also takes the position that a cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of an armed attack without loss of life or physical damage, citing as an example the\"long-term outage of critical infrastructure\".[69] Finally, the US position can be similarly interpreted, stating that it\"[r]eserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend... from hostile acts in cyberspace. Hostile acts may include significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military\".[70] Published by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601 ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\nBased on the above, it can be considered that at least some cyber operations that cause serious economic damage without causing material damage may fulfil the characteristics of prohibited use of force within the meaning of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter and even armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which may lead to the use of force in self-defense. This conclusion has long been held by a number of scholars and other experts and recent state practice clearly supports them.\nDefining the exact boundary of cyber operations against financial infrastructure that cross the threshold of the use of force is not possible at this time. However, it is reasonable to expect that the threshold will be relatively high and most cyber operations against financial infrastructure will not cross it.71 However, a guide may be the national position of France, which explicitly states that a non-destructive cyber operation may fulfil the characteristics of use of force taking into account the following criteria: the circumstances prevailing at the time of the operation, the origin of the operation, the nature of the instigator, the extent of intrusion, the actual or intended effects or the nature of the intended target.72 ## 5 Conclusion The main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of\"scale and effects\"and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover Published by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601 ICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\n## List of references Canada.

It took place when the brilliant (and mad) scientist Rick and his grandchildren gained access to the main computer of the Galactic Government and changed the value of its national currency from 1 to 0. As a result, in the following scene, the government and society as a whole completely disintegrates.\nThis situation is a surprisingly realistic example of what a cyber operation targeting a state's critical financial infrastructure can lead to. Modern society and its functioning depend on countless information systems. The vast majority of financial transactions take place in cyberspace. Whether it is the payment of employee salaries, international transactions, securities trading, private bank transfers or the payment of pensions, the proper functioning of these mechanisms is virtually unimaginable today without information systems. Unsurprisingly, most states rank financial and banking systems as their critical infrastructure.³ States' dependence on this infrastructure makes it an attractive target not only for self-interested hackers, but can also play an important role in relations between states. Indeed, taking this critical infrastructure out of service can throw society into chaos, destabilize the economy and cause enormous material damage.⁴ In other words, the consequences of a cyber operation targeting critical financial infrastructure can be significantly more severe than those of a conventional armed attack.⁵\nStates are aware of this risk, and perhaps this is why the question of whether a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure attributable to another state⁶ that does not cause direct material damage (non-destructive cyber operation) could be considered a prohibited use of force in violation of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter or even an armed attack justifying the use of force in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and if so, under what conditions, has come to the forefront of academic and political interest.\nThe aim of this article is to get closer to answering this question, based on a thorough study of the academic literature and state practice. Particularly in the field of state practice, a lot of newly available information can be found which sheds new light on the question. However, the article does not aim to define the precise conditions under which a cyber operation against critical financial infra-\n³ Critical infrastructure can be defined as: \"Physical or virtual systems and assets of a State that are so vital that their incapacitation or destruction may debilitate a State's security, economy, public health or safety, or the environment.\" See &lt; https://cyberlaw.ccdcoe.org/wiki/Glossary&gt;.\n⁴ PRECIADO, Michael.

Such a clear-cut definition is not even possible at this time due to the lack of relevant state practice. However, it can be considered that there is now sufficient evidence to answer the primary question, i.e. whether at least some (most serious) non-destructive cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure can be considered a prohibited use of force or armed attack.\nSatisfactory answering of the main research question presupposes the resolution of several international law subquestions, according to which the structure of this article was also chosen.\nThus, the first part of this article briefly summarizes analytical approaches to categorization of cyber operations as uses of force in general and demonstrates that the effects-based approach is generally the most appropriate approach, which also forms the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure. The second part of the article defines the difference between economic coercion, which is usually legal and certainly cannot be considered a prohibited use of force, and a cyber operation against critical financial infrastructure, which could meet the characteristics of a prohibited use of force. Finally, the third part of the article is devoted to a thorough analysis of state practices related to cyber operations against critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on financial and banking infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## ## 5 Conclusion\n\nThe main objective of this article was to answer the question whether cyber operations against critical financial infrastructure that cause only economic damage (i.e., non-destructive cyber operations) can meet the characteristics of use of force or armed attack.\nThe first part of the article was devoted to the analysis of analytical approaches, through which it is possible to determine whether a cyber operation meets the characteristics of the use of force or armed attack, namely the instrument-based approach, target-based approach and effects-based approach. These are competing approaches, but to date it is safe to conclude that practice has tended towards the third approach, as demonstrated by a number of examples of state practice. Thus, it is the effects-based approach, which is based on the doctrine of \"scale and effects\" and equates the consequences of a cyber operation with a conventional attack, that needs to be applied in the context of non-destructive cyber operations when addressing the question of whether it is a prohibited use of force.\nThe second part of the article addressed the question of whether a cyber operation causing only economic damage is a type of economic coercion. If so, such an operation could not meet the characteristics of use of force, since economic coercion is a legitimate means of enforcing foreign policy. However, there are fundamental differences between economic coercion and a cyber operation with only economic consequences (the latter is an interference with the sover\nPublished by Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic, 2022.\nISSN (print): 1213-8770; ISSN (online): 2464-6601\nICLR, 2022, Vol. 22, No. 2.\neighty of the State and does not correspond to economic coercion in the method of execution), and therefore it was concluded that the permissibility of such a cyber operation cannot be derived from the permissibility of economic coercion, as it is a completely different situation.\nThe third and final part of the article specifically addressed the question of whether a non-destructive cyber operation can meet the characteristics of a use of force or an armed attack. While in 2017 (at the time of the publication of Tallinn Manual 2.0) there was considerable uncertainty about the answer, the situation seems to have clarified in recent years and it can be concluded that at least the most serious non-destructive cyber operations that seriously damage the economy and finances of the attacked state can fulfil the characteristics of both use of force and armed attack. The decisive factor that tipped the balance in favor of an affirmative answer to the above research question is primarily the newly published national positions on the application of international law in cyberspace. In particular, these include France (2019), Italy (2021), Norway (2021) and Singapore (2021).\nWe can only conclude that given the extreme dependence of modern society on information technology, even non-destructive cyber operations can cause enormous and even fatal (economic) damage leading to chaos and disintegration of society. Effects that were previously reserved for conventional military force.73 It is therefore not surprising that more and more states are making it clear that they will consider major cyber operations of the above nature to be a prohibited use of force or even an armed attack that constitutes a right of self-defense. We can only hope that such an open definition of the playing field will fulfil its preventive purpose and that the world will never have to face armed conflict just because someone changed 1 to 0.\nCanada.
