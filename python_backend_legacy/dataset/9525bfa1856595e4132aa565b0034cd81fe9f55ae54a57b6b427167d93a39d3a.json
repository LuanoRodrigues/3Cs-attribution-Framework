Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks. Specifically, this Paper considers cyber-attacks to\n\n† Yale Law School, J.D. expected 2015; The Pennsylvania State University, B.A. 2012.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information.¹ In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time.² Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur,³ a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces,⁴ and discussions within\n\n¹ Todd C.

This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸ States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\n\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks.

Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in.

The Development of International Law of War\n\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war.¹⁹ In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort.²⁰ The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\n\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n\n¹⁹ Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n²⁰ Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization,²¹ where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\n\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks.

Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\n\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks.²³ The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon.²⁴ A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects.²⁵ A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n\n²² See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L.

Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach.³² The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks.

This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\n\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery.³³ This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense.³⁴ The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n\n³³ Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J.

The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity.³⁵ Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account.³⁶ Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework.³⁷ Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\n\nii.

It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach.⁴¹ The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”⁴² Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\n\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n\n³⁸ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n³⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n⁴⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n⁴¹ See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n⁴² Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\n\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges.⁴⁴ However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\n\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity.⁴⁵ As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n\n⁴³ See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n⁴⁴ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 1121.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The “Effects-Based” Approach\n\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual.⁴⁷ As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\n\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences.⁴⁸ Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force.⁴⁹ The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n\n⁴⁶ *Id.*\n\n⁴⁷ *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n\n⁴⁸ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n\n⁴⁹ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”⁵⁰\n\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack.⁵¹ Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach.⁵² Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack⁵³; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”⁵⁴).

To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\n\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach.⁵⁶ His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n\n⁵⁵ Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n⁵⁶ Id. at 577.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n\n⁵⁷ See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n⁵⁸ Daniel B.

Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield.

While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind.

In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\n\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council⁷⁶ have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council.⁷⁷ This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China.⁷⁸ Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n\n⁷⁶ The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n⁷⁷ Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\n\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks.

Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\n\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures.

In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\n\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ.

While in traditional cases it would be simple to determine the effects of a countermeasure, in the digital age “there is no guarantee that . . . reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect.”87\n\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n\n## C.

Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\n\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack.⁹⁰ Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities.

However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”⁹²\n\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world.⁹³ The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n\n⁹¹ International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n⁹² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n⁹³ Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\n\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n\n94 This proposition is supported by the rational choice theory of international law compliance. See generally, Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works (2008); Jeremy Lawrence, Treaty Violations, Section 1983, and International Law Theory, 16 SW. J. INT'L L. 1 (2010) (“Rational choice theories of international law assume that nation-states act in a way best calculated to achieve their objectives. Decisions about whether to act unilaterally or cooperatively in compliance with treaties and customary norms, or in violation of treaties and norms, are made according to calculations about the decisions’ likely costs and benefits.”).\n\n95 Indeed, the United States has repeatedly emphasized its intent to continue developing offensive cyber capabilities, and has not hesitated to commit the use of those weapons to defend national interests. In March 2014, the United States announced its intent to substantially increase its Cyber Command division, in an attempt to “ensure[] the security of the United States and critical infrastructure.” Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cyberwarfare Force to Grow Significantly, Defense Secretary Says,”Wash.

By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\n\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond.

The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\n\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country.

Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\n\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .”¹⁰¹ In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\n\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem,¹⁰² this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.¹⁰³\n\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n\n¹⁰¹ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n¹⁰² Discussed below in section III (c).\n¹⁰³ See section III (c) below on attribution.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\n\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect.

Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\n\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\n\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure.¹⁰⁵ Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\n\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\n\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n\n¹⁰⁵ Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\n\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\n\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

In itself, this type of attack would fundamentally impair the target country's strategic power by significantly disrupting its military infrastructure. As such, the target country would be justified in using self-defense.\n\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack.¹⁰⁶ This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.¹⁰⁷\n\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a\n\n¹⁰⁶ See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v.

Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\n\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\n\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\n\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system.¹⁰⁸ In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.”¹¹⁰ Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .”¹¹¹ This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n\n## III.

Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N.

Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\n\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).¹¹⁷\n\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\n\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).¹¹⁸\n\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British.¹¹⁹ Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden,¹²⁰ the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51.

Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive.¹²² This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War,¹²³ the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon,¹²⁴ and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.¹²⁵\n\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent.

Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.¹³¹\n\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\n\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force.¹³² This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.¹³³\n\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n\n¹³⁰ Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n¹³¹ See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n¹³² Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response.

The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.¹⁴³\n\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks.¹⁴⁴ This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence.

Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\n\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.”¹⁴⁶ The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence.¹⁴⁷ Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence.¹⁴⁸ While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\n\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n\n¹⁴⁶ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n¹⁴⁷ In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear.

In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.”¹⁴⁹ Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.¹⁵⁰\n\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit.¹⁵¹ In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force.

Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct.

Fear of Escalation\n\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation.¹⁵⁵ The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\n\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality.¹⁵⁶ Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves.¹⁵⁷ Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n\n¹⁵⁵ See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n¹⁵⁶ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁵⁷ Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

These strict requirements of necessity and proportionality would regulate the types of responses engaged in by states, and limit the threat of escalation.\n\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51.¹⁵⁸ As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\n\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n\n¹⁵⁸ By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.”¹⁵⁹ A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law.¹⁶⁰ It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system.¹⁶¹ By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n\n## C.

The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict.¹⁶⁵ If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\n\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n\n## IV. Conclusion\n\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸⁵ A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n\n¹⁸⁴ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n\n¹⁸⁵ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Charter.¹⁸⁶\n\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution.¹⁸⁷ As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system.

Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information.¹ In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time.² Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur,³ a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces,⁴ and discussions within\n¹ Todd C.

For instance, China is aggressively increasing its cyber-potential, and has even begun to actively train university students in cyberwarfare.⁶ Similarly, since 2010 the North Korean government has been training thousands of computer science students on how to conduct cyber warfare.⁷ This has resulted in an increase in cyber-attacks coming from North Korea targeted at the United States and South Korea.⁸ The most high profile of these attacks came in late November 2014, when hackers broke into Sony Pictures’ computers through a string of cyberattacks.⁹ The hackers “wiped out Sony computers,” leaked private emails, and\n⁵ David E.

As the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence put it, \"[i]f someone was trying to shut down our power grid when there is a huge polar vortex blowing through the country, that would have a serious impact on us.\"¹⁷\nThe response of major countries and the international community has essentially been to do nothing.

[2014]\nresponse the United States will take against North Korea for the November 2014 Sony Pictures attacks). This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸ States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important\n¹⁸ See, e.g., John T. Parry, *What is the Grotian Tradition in International Law*, 35 U. P.A. J.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks\nAs the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhat they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war.¹⁹ In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort.²⁰ The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n¹⁹ Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n²⁰ Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization,²¹ where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber-\n²¹ U.N.

[2014]\nattacks,²² the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks.²³ The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon.²⁴ A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects.²⁵ A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n²² See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n²³ See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities . . . was not contemplated by the drafters . . . does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n²⁴ Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.*\n²⁷ *Id.* at 1103.\n²⁸ *Id.* at 1104.\n²⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n³⁰ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n53\nwhen does such force constitute an armed attack under Article 51?³¹\nIn response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach.³² The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three\n³¹ See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n³² TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N.

This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery.³³ This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense.³⁴ The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n³³ Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n³⁴ Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nnuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity.³⁵ Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account.³⁶ Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework.³⁷ Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach\n³⁵ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n³⁶ Id.\n³⁷ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model.³⁸ This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense.³⁹ Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources.⁴⁰ This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach.⁴¹ The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”⁴² Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n³⁸ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n³⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n⁴⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n⁴¹ See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n⁴² Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\noverbroad.⁴³ Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges.⁴⁴ However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity.⁴⁵ As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n⁴³ See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n⁴⁴ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014]\narising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries.⁴⁶ Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual.⁴⁷ As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences.⁴⁸ Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force.⁴⁹ The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n⁴⁶ *Id.*\n⁴⁷ *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n⁴⁸ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n⁴⁹ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”⁵⁰\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack.⁵¹ Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach.⁵² Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack⁵³; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”⁵⁴). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s\n⁵⁰ Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n⁵¹ 76 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES: COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACK AND INTERNATIONAL LAW (Michael N. Schmitt &amp; Brian O’Donnell eds., 2002); Michael N. Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited, 56 Vill. L. Rev. 569 (2011).\n⁵² See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n⁵³ Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nconsequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors.⁵⁵ Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach.⁵⁶ His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n⁵⁵ Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n⁵⁶ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nDespite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry.⁵⁷ Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.”⁵⁸ Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.⁵⁹\nReese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n⁵⁷ See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n⁵⁸ Daniel B.

China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack.⁶³ On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense\n⁶⁰ The U.N. Charter does not consider disruption of communications to be a use of force. U.N.

Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual.⁶⁵ Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n⁶⁴ Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n⁶⁵ TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nIn the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70\nWhile the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nTallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches\nSeveral other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered\n71 Michael N. Schmitt, International Law in Cyberspace The Koh Speech and Tallinn Manual Juxtaposed, 54 HARV. INT’L. L.J. 13 (2012) (“Uncertainty as to what those scale and effects are plagued the Tallinn Manual deliberations”).\n72 Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1125.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\narmed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74\nNguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of\n73 Id.\n74 Id. at 1127.\n75 See, e.g., Statement of General Keith B. Alexander, Commander United States Cyber Command, Committee on Senate Armed Services, Feb. 27, 2014; http://www.digitalattackmap.com/ provides a real-time global map of current cyber attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nimmediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council⁷⁶ have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council.⁷⁷ This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China.⁷⁸ Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n⁷⁶ The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n⁷⁷ Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nstrong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of\n79 See, e.g., id. at 582.\n80 Report of the International Law Commission, 53d Sess., U.N. Doc. A/56/10; GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10 (2001).\n81 Michael N.

J, OF INT’L L. 6 (2014).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\ncountermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness.⁸² As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased.⁸³ Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.⁸⁴\nFrom a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the\n⁸² International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001)\n⁸³ Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n⁸⁴ Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntarget state. $^{85}$ Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. $^{86}$ In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n71\nneed to be careful that its responses did not amount to a use of force, something that can be quite difficult to predict. While in traditional cases it would be simple to determine the effects of a countermeasure, in the digital age “there is no guarantee that . . . reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect.”87\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice\nAs has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state\n87 Katharine C. Hinkle, *Countermeasures in the Cyber Context One More Thing to Worry About*, 37 Yale J. of Int’l Law Online 11, 20 (Fall 2011).\n88 *Id.* at 21.\n89 U.N.

Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack.⁹⁰ Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack . . . if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nhas taken.⁹¹ Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”⁹²\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world.⁹³ The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n⁹¹ International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n⁹² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n⁹³ Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ndamage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nThis first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n94 This proposition is supported by the rational choice theory of international law compliance. See generally, Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works (2008); Jeremy Lawrence, Treaty Violations, Section 1983, and International Law Theory, 16 SW. J. INT'L L. 1 (2010) (“Rational choice theories of international law assume that nation-states act in a way best calculated to achieve their objectives. Decisions about whether to act unilaterally or cooperatively in compliance with treaties and customary norms, or in violation of treaties and norms, are made according to calculations about the decisions’ likely costs and benefits.”).\n95 Indeed, the United States has repeatedly emphasized its intent to continue developing offensive cyber capabilities, and has not hesitated to commit the use of those weapons to defend national interests. In March 2014, the United States announced its intent to substantially increase its Cyber Command division, in an attempt to “ensure[] the security of the United States and critical infrastructure.” Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cyberwarfare Force to Grow Significantly, Defense Secretary Says,”Wash. Post, Mar. 28, 2014.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nSecond, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nsituation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe right to use all necessary means . . . in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.¹⁰⁰\nAs a leading country in the international scene, and the largest target of cyber-attacks, the United States has set the example for what conduct countries will tolerate, and when they will resort to self-defense. A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account\nHaving identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n¹⁰⁰ *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .”¹⁰¹ In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem,¹⁰² this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.¹⁰³\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n¹⁰¹ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n¹⁰² Discussed below in section III (c).\n¹⁰³ See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nnexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^[104]\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure.¹⁰⁵ Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n¹⁰⁵ Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ncountries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n83\nwould be singly sufficient to constitute an armed attack. In itself, this type of attack would fundamentally impair the target country's strategic power by significantly disrupting its military infrastructure. As such, the target country would be justified in using self-defense.\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack.¹⁰⁶ This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.¹⁰⁷\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a\n¹⁰⁶ See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27) (considering whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”); *Oil Platforms*, (Iran v. U.S.), Judgment, 2003 I.C.J. 161 (Nov. 6) (considering whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”).\n¹⁰⁷ John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, N.Y. TIMES, Aug. 12, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html (“You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to” (quoting Bill Woodcock)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nspecific military or strategic resource can be inferred to have the intent of undermining the target country's sovereign power. Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\napproach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system.¹⁰⁸ In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nhas been interpreted through state practice.”¹⁰⁹ International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.”¹¹⁰ Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .”¹¹¹ This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III. Anticipated Criticism\nAny novel proposal of change to a conventional interpretation of international law can\n¹⁰⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 73.\n¹¹⁰ Ruys, supra note 86, at 21 (quoting Arbitration regarding the Iron Rhine Railway (Belgium v.

[2014]\nanticipate criticism. Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold.¹¹² These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.”¹¹³ This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.”¹¹⁴ Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.¹¹⁵\nThinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’”¹¹⁶ Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of\n¹¹² Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

[2014]\nthe attack. Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).¹¹⁷\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).¹¹⁸\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British.¹¹⁹ Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden,¹²⁰ the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air\n¹¹⁷ *Id.* at 157.\n¹¹⁸ *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n¹¹⁹ U.N.

S/PV .1107, at 2, 3 April 1964, § 3 (UK).\n¹²⁰ A British colony until 1963.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nattacks . . . carried out in spite of protests and warnings.”¹²¹ Although the U.N. Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive.¹²² This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War,¹²³ the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon,¹²⁴ and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.¹²⁵\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others.¹²⁶ Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no\n¹²¹ U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n¹²² See, e.g., U.N. Doc.

[2014]\npoint was there any suggestion that China could consider the event an “armed attack” justifying self-defense.¹²⁷ This may seem intuitive, but it is worth pointing out that the underlying reason was that there was no aggressive intent.\nTaken together, these examples demonstrate that: first, absent *de minimis* intensity, events can still be justifiably considered armed attacks based on their aggressive intent; and, second, that events crossing the *de minimis* threshold may not trigger Article 51, absent aggressive intent.¹²⁸ This analysis enforces this Paper’s contention that the conventional “use of force” and “armed attack” focus on physical violence was selected merely as a proxy for which to identify other policies that the drafters of the Charter wished to further and protect – in this case, preventing aggressive actions between countries.\nAdditionally, this provides a satisfactory explanation of why minor border skirmishes are generally not considered to be armed attacks.¹²⁹ Rather than explaining these events as simply not crossing the *de minimis* threshold, it makes more sense to explain that border skirmishes carry a rebuttable presumption of a lack of aggressive\n¹²⁷ Ruys, *supra* note 86, at 165.\n¹²⁸ “In the end, the Definition of Aggression, the case law of the ICJ and customary practice provide credible indications that hostile intent is a relevant factor for determining whether an ‘armed attack’ has occurred.” *Id.* at 166.\n¹²⁹ See Hathaway et al, *supra* note 22 (“The ICJ has indicated that cross-border incursions that are minor in their ‘scale and effects’ may be classified as mere ‘frontier incident[s]’ rather than ‘armed attacks.’” (quoting Nicaragua)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nintent.¹³⁰ It is generally to be expected that the situation on a border may create friction, and that periodic forceful engagements may occur. Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.¹³¹\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force.¹³² This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.¹³³\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n¹³⁰ Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n¹³¹ See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n¹³² Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹³³ Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nthat the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), $^{134}$ Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), $^{135}$ Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), $^{136}$ Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), $^{137}$ Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), $^{138}$ Liberia (against Guinea), $^{139}$ and Sudan (against Chad). $^{140}$ Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”$^{141}$ The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”$^{142}$ This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nseverity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.¹⁴³\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks.¹⁴⁴ This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.¹⁴⁵\n¹⁴³ Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n¹⁴⁴ Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹⁴⁵ Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals. While states should be able to respond to a series of attacks before they are carried out entirely, there\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.”¹⁴⁶ The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence.¹⁴⁷ Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence.¹⁴⁸ While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n¹⁴⁶ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n¹⁴⁷ In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n¹⁴⁸ See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. . . . The most important object . . . is to . . . restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.”¹⁴⁹ Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.¹⁵⁰\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit.¹⁵¹ In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative\n¹⁴⁹ Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n¹⁵⁰ Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n¹⁵¹ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nconcerns of the states.\"¹⁵² With the growing disconnect between the \"shorthand\" and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve.¹⁵³ Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack\" that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks \"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\"¹⁵⁴ Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope\n¹⁵² *Id.* at 604.\n¹⁵³ *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences . . . drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n¹⁵⁴ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation.¹⁵⁵ The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality.¹⁵⁶ Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves.¹⁵⁷ Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n¹⁵⁵ See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n¹⁵⁶ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁵⁷ Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n99\nof Article 51 to cover some “pure-cyber” attacks (attacks with no physical effect), states responding to such attacks would have a heavy burden to respond to such attacks using cyber-responses. These strict requirements of necessity and proportionality would regulate the types of responses engaged in by states, and limit the threat of escalation.\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51.¹⁵⁸ As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n¹⁵⁸ By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nStates can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.”¹⁵⁹ A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law.¹⁶⁰ It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system.¹⁶¹ By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem\nPerhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no\n¹⁵⁹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁶⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n¹⁶¹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.

[2014]\nphysical weapons to determine the country of origin.¹⁶² Cyber-attacks come out of the shadows, with their paths often being obscured through rerouted and masked IP addresses.¹⁶³ It is often only after time has passed that it becomes clear where the attack originated from, and even years later there may be no definite answer.¹⁶⁴ This problem has led many to criticize expanding Article 51 self-defense to cover responses to cyber-attacks. The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict.¹⁶⁵ If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from.¹⁶⁶ A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a \"honeypot\" in place to detect and identify\n¹⁶² It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending \"anonymous\" soldiers into another country to conduct operations.

In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks.¹⁶⁸ Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).¹⁶⁹ Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers.¹⁷⁰ The ability to accurately attribute the source of cyber-attacks is likely to improve as technology develops and as countries begin to funnel more resources into their cyber-capabilities.¹⁷¹\nEven where an attack can be traced to a specific country of origin, the attack must be\n¹⁶⁷ Id.\n¹⁶⁸ See David E.

[2014]\nattributed to a state actor to trigger self-defense. This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals.¹⁷² For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible.¹⁷³ Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to.¹⁷⁴ This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁷⁵ By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state\n¹⁷² Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n¹⁷³ Michael N.

The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State . . . if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own”¹⁷⁶ by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.¹⁷⁷\nIn the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility.¹⁷⁸ Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan.¹⁷⁹ When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N. Security Council condemned the Taliban for “allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism . . . and for\n¹⁷⁶ International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the Int’l Law Comm’n, 53d Sess., Apr. 23-June 1, July 2-Aug. 10, 2001, U.N.

The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks,¹⁸² a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations.¹⁸³ Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber-\n¹⁸⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n¹⁸¹ David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸⁵ A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n¹⁸⁴ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n¹⁸⁵ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n107\nproviding for a governing system through the U.N. Charter.¹⁸⁶\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution.¹⁸⁷ As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to\n¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 32-33.\n¹⁸⁷ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks. Specifically, this Paper considers cyber-attacks to\n† Yale Law School, J.D. expected 2015; The Pennsylvania State University, B.A. 2012.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information. In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time. Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur, a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, and discussions within\n Todd C.

For instance, China is aggressively increasing its cyber-potential, and has even begun to actively train university students in cyberwarfare. Similarly, since 2010 the North Korean government has been training thousands of computer science students on how to conduct cyber warfare. This has resulted in an increase in cyber-attacks coming from North Korea targeted at the United States and South Korea. The most high profile of these attacks came in late November 2014, when hackers broke into Sony Pictures’ computers through a string of cyberattacks.

Although intense research and development in making practical quantum computers has been ongoing for decades, the current offerings are too expensive for anyone but large corporations. Developments in this field are ongoing, and the NSA is investigating quantum computing’s potential to hack nearly all standard cryptographic technology.

Two areas are of particular concern for U.S. national security: the national fuel supply infrastructure and power grid. These have been criticized for being susceptible to a well-designed cyber-attack, and present appealing targets to malicious hackers wishing to cause crippling harm to the country. As the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence put it, \"[i]f someone was trying to shut down our power grid when there is a huge polar vortex blowing through the country, that would have a serious impact on us.\"\nThe response of major countries and the international community has essentially been to do nothing.

This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm. States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important\n See, e.g., John T.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks\nAs the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhat they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war. In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort. The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization, where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber-\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nattacks, the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks. The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon. A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects. A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities . . . was not contemplated by the drafters . . . does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Application of the laws of war is further complicated by the fact that the effects of cyber-attacks are often reversible, and that immediate attribution as to the source of the attack is often nearly impossible. In combination, these characteristics make cyber-attacks a unique use of force and complicate the *jus ad bellum* analysis.\nThese novel features of cyber attacks, render the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack” insufficient to confront the growing threat of cyber-attacks. Academics have confronted this problem head-on, acknowledging that “[g]iven the rising threat of cyber attacks as a weapon of warfare, it will be necessary to develop a coherent analytical framework under jus ad bellum.” The major questions that a new framework must answer, and that this Paper confronts, are: 1) When do cyber activities amount to a threat or use of force under Article 2(4); and 2)\n The first Internet worm, the Morris worm, was intended to simply map out the scope of the Internet. Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.*\n *Id.* at 1103.\n *Id.* at 1104.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach. The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three\n See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napproaches that the Tallinn Manual either adopted or discarded (instrument-, target-, and effects-based), before turning to the Tallinn Manual itself. This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery. This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense. The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nnuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity. Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account. Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework. Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n Id.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model. This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense. Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources. This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach. The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\noverbroad. Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges. However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity. As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014]\narising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries. Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual. As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences. Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force. The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n *Id.*\n *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack. Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach. Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s\n Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nconsequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors. Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach. His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nDespite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry. Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.” Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.\nReese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n Daniel B.

Nguyen argues that Schmitt’s factors are too “malleable,” leading to limited effective utility for state leaders.\nNguyen further argues that this sort of effects-based analysis is ineffective, as different states will have different capabilities for detecting and mitigating cyber attacks. For instance, China, the United States, and North Korea could all suffer entirely different effects from the same cyber attack. China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack. On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense\n The U.N.

[2014]\n\nA useful analogy is to imagine a country (Country A) with a highly effective missile shield. Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual. Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nIn the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70\nWhile the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nTallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches\nSeveral other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\narmed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74\nNguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nimmediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council. This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China. Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nstrong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\ncountermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness. As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased. Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.\nFrom a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the\n International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001)\n Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntarget state. $^{85}$ Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. $^{86}$ In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice\nAs has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof each of the leading frameworks, and none of the “alternate” solutions is sufficient to cover the problems that cyber-attacks present to *jus ad bellum*. Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack. Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States\n See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack . . . if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nhas taken. Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world. The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ndamage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nThis first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nSecond, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nsituation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe right to use all necessary means . . . in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\nAs a leading country in the international scene, and the largest target of cyber-attacks, the United States has set the example for what conduct countries will tolerate, and when they will resort to self-defense. A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account\nHaving identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .” In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem, this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n Discussed below in section III (c).\n See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nnexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^[104]\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ncountries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack. This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor.

Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\napproach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system. In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nhas been interpreted through state practice.” International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.” Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .” This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III.

[2014]\nanticipate criticism. Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold. These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.” This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.” Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.\nThinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’” Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

[2014]\nthe attack. Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British. Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden, the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air\n *Id.* at 157.\n *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, at 2, 3 April 1964, § 3 (UK).\n A British colony until 1963.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nattacks . . . carried out in spite of protests and warnings.” Although the U.N. Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive. This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War, the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon, and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others. Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n See, e.g., U.N. Doc. S/PV .1108, 6 April 1964, at §§ 32-5 (Morocco), 48-50 (Ivory Coast).\n (1967) UNYB 175.\n (1968) UNYB 191.\n (2006) UNYB 498.\n (1999) 45 Keesing’s 42955.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\npoint was there any suggestion that China could consider the event an “armed attack” justifying self-defense. This may seem intuitive, but it is worth pointing out that the underlying reason was that there was no aggressive intent.\nTaken together, these examples demonstrate that: first, absent *de minimis* intensity, events can still be justifiably considered armed attacks based on their aggressive intent; and, second, that events crossing the *de minimis* threshold may not trigger Article 51, absent aggressive intent. This analysis enforces this Paper’s contention that the conventional “use of force” and “armed attack” focus on physical violence was selected merely as a proxy for which to identify other policies that the drafters of the Charter wished to further and protect – in this case, preventing aggressive actions between countries.\nAdditionally, this provides a satisfactory explanation of why minor border skirmishes are generally not considered to be armed attacks. Rather than explaining these events as simply not crossing the *de minimis* threshold, it makes more sense to explain that border skirmishes carry a rebuttable presumption of a lack of aggressive\n Ruys, *supra* note 86, at 165.\n “In the end, the Definition of Aggression, the case law of the ICJ and customary practice provide credible indications that hostile intent is a relevant factor for determining whether an ‘armed attack’ has occurred.” *Id.* at 166.\n See Hathaway et al, *supra* note 22 (“The ICJ has indicated that cross-border incursions that are minor in their ‘scale and effects’ may be classified as mere ‘frontier incident[s]’ rather than ‘armed attacks.’” (quoting Nicaragua)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nintent. It is generally to be expected that the situation on a border may create friction, and that periodic forceful engagements may occur. Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force. This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nthat the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), $^{134}$ Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), $^{135}$ Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), $^{136}$ Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), $^{137}$ Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), $^{138}$ Liberia (against Guinea), $^{139}$ and Sudan (against Chad). $^{140}$ Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”$^{141}$ The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”$^{142}$ This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nseverity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks. This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals. While states should be able to respond to a series of attacks before they are carried out entirely, there\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.” The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence. While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. . . . The most important object . . . is to . . . restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.” Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit. In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative\n Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nconcerns of the states.\" With the growing disconnect between the \"shorthand\" and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve. Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack\" that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks \"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\" Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope\n *Id.* at 604.\n *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences . . . drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation. The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality. Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves. Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51. As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nStates can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.” A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law. It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system. By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem\nPerhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.

[2014]\nphysical weapons to determine the country of origin. Cyber-attacks come out of the shadows, with their paths often being obscured through rerouted and masked IP addresses. It is often only after time has passed that it becomes clear where the attack originated from, and even years later there may be no definite answer. This problem has led many to criticize expanding Article 51 self-defense to cover responses to cyber-attacks. The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict. If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from. A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a \"honeypot\" in place to detect and identify\n It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending \"anonymous\" soldiers into another country to conduct operations.

This type of tracking is already making itself apparent. In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks. Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers.

This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals. For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible. Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to. This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n Michael N.

The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State . . . if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own” by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.\nIn the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility. Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan. When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N.

The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks, a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations. Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber-\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm. A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution. As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to\n *Id.* at 32-33.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information. In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time. Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur, a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, and discussions within\n Todd C.

For instance, China is aggressively increasing its cyber-potential, and has even begun to actively train university students in cyberwarfare. Similarly, since 2010 the North Korean government has been training thousands of computer science students on how to conduct cyber warfare. This has resulted in an increase in cyber-attacks coming from North Korea targeted at the United States and South Korea. The most high profile of these attacks came in late November 2014, when hackers broke into Sony Pictures’ computers through a string of cyberattacks.

Simply put, quantum computers are machines that operate in a fundamentally different manner than classic computers, and will be able to process information differently, allowing for capabilities outside classical computing. Although intense research and development in making practical quantum computers has been ongoing for decades, the current offerings are too expensive for anyone but large corporations. Developments in this field are ongoing, and the NSA is investigating quantum computing’s potential to hack nearly all standard cryptographic technology.

Two areas are of particular concern for U.S. national security: the national fuel supply infrastructure and power grid. These have been criticized for being susceptible to a well-designed cyber-attack, and present appealing targets to malicious hackers wishing to cause crippling harm to the country. As the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence put it, \"[i]f someone was trying to shut down our power grid when there is a huge polar vortex blowing through the country, that would have a serious impact on us.\"\nThe response of major countries and the international community has essentially been to do nothing.

This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm. States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important\n See, e.g., John T.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks\nAs the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhat they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war. In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort. The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization, where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber-\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nattacks, the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks. The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon. A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects. A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities . . . was not contemplated by the drafters . . . does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Application of the laws of war is further complicated by the fact that the effects of cyber-attacks are often reversible, and that immediate attribution as to the source of the attack is often nearly impossible. In combination, these characteristics make cyber-attacks a unique use of force and complicate the *jus ad bellum* analysis.\nThese novel features of cyber attacks, render the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack” insufficient to confront the growing threat of cyber-attacks. Academics have confronted this problem head-on, acknowledging that “[g]iven the rising threat of cyber attacks as a weapon of warfare, it will be necessary to develop a coherent analytical framework under jus ad bellum.” The major questions that a new framework must answer, and that this Paper confronts, are: 1) When do cyber activities amount to a threat or use of force under Article 2(4); and 2)\n The first Internet worm, the Morris worm, was intended to simply map out the scope of the Internet. Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.*\n *Id.* at 1103.\n *Id.* at 1104.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach. The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three\n See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napproaches that the Tallinn Manual either adopted or discarded (instrument-, target-, and effects-based), before turning to the Tallinn Manual itself. This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery. This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense. The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nnuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity. Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account. Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework. Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n Id.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model. This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense. Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources. This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach. The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\noverbroad. Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges. However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity. As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014]\narising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries. Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual. As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences. Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force. The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n *Id.*\n *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack. Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach. Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s\n Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nconsequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors. Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach. His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nDespite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry. Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.” Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.\nReese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n Daniel B.

O’Donnell eds., 2002).\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 541.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nminimal, as the attacks were executed remotely with no direct penetration; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify (which Schmitt would agree with); (6) the attacks were limited to telecommunications systems, making them presumptively legitimate. Nguyen argues that Schmitt’s factors are too “malleable,” leading to limited effective utility for state leaders.\nNguyen further argues that this sort of effects-based analysis is ineffective, as different states will have different capabilities for detecting and mitigating cyber attacks. For instance, China, the United States, and North Korea could all suffer entirely different effects from the same cyber attack. China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack. On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense\n The U.N. Charter does not consider disruption of communications to be a use of force. U.N. Charter, art. 41.\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1124.\n Id.\n Reuters, “Washington Is Limited In Its Response to N.

[2014]\n\nA useful analogy is to imagine a country (Country A) with a highly effective missile shield. Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual. Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nIn the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70\nWhile the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nTallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches\nSeveral other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\narmed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74\nNguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nimmediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council. This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China. Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nstrong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\ncountermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness. As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased. Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.\nFrom a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the\n International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001)\n Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntarget state. $^{85}$ Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. $^{86}$ In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice\nAs has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof each of the leading frameworks, and none of the “alternate” solutions is sufficient to cover the problems that cyber-attacks present to *jus ad bellum*. Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack. Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States\n See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack . . . if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nhas taken. Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world. The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ndamage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nThis first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nSecond, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nsituation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC.

A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account\nHaving identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .” In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem, this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n Discussed below in section III (c).\n See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nnexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^[104]\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ncountries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack. This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a\n See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27) (considering whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”); *Oil Platforms*, (Iran v. U.S.), Judgment, 2003 I.C.J. 161 (Nov. 6) (considering whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”).\n John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, N.Y. TIMES, Aug. 12, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html (“You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to” (quoting Bill Woodcock)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nspecific military or strategic resource can be inferred to have the intent of undermining the target country's sovereign power. Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\napproach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system. In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nhas been interpreted through state practice.” International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.” Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .” This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III. Anticipated Criticism\nAny novel proposal of change to a conventional interpretation of international law can\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 73.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 21 (quoting Arbitration regarding the Iron Rhine Railway (Belgium v.

[2014]\nanticipate criticism. Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold. These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.” This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.” Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.\nThinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’” Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

[2014]\nthe attack. Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British. Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden, the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air\n *Id.* at 157.\n *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, at 2, 3 April 1964, § 3 (UK).\n A British colony until 1963.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nattacks . . . carried out in spite of protests and warnings.” Although the U.N. Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive. This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War, the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon, and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others. Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n See, e.g., U.N. Doc. S/PV .1108, 6 April 1964, at §§ 32-5 (Morocco), 48-50 (Ivory Coast).\n (1967) UNYB 175.\n (1968) UNYB 191.\n (2006) UNYB 498.\n (1999) 45 Keesing’s 42955.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\npoint was there any suggestion that China could consider the event an “armed attack” justifying self-defense. This may seem intuitive, but it is worth pointing out that the underlying reason was that there was no aggressive intent.\nTaken together, these examples demonstrate that: first, absent *de minimis* intensity, events can still be justifiably considered armed attacks based on their aggressive intent; and, second, that events crossing the *de minimis* threshold may not trigger Article 51, absent aggressive intent. This analysis enforces this Paper’s contention that the conventional “use of force” and “armed attack” focus on physical violence was selected merely as a proxy for which to identify other policies that the drafters of the Charter wished to further and protect – in this case, preventing aggressive actions between countries.\nAdditionally, this provides a satisfactory explanation of why minor border skirmishes are generally not considered to be armed attacks. Rather than explaining these events as simply not crossing the *de minimis* threshold, it makes more sense to explain that border skirmishes carry a rebuttable presumption of a lack of aggressive\n Ruys, *supra* note 86, at 165.\n “In the end, the Definition of Aggression, the case law of the ICJ and customary practice provide credible indications that hostile intent is a relevant factor for determining whether an ‘armed attack’ has occurred.” *Id.* at 166.\n See Hathaway et al, *supra* note 22 (“The ICJ has indicated that cross-border incursions that are minor in their ‘scale and effects’ may be classified as mere ‘frontier incident[s]’ rather than ‘armed attacks.’” (quoting Nicaragua)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nintent. It is generally to be expected that the situation on a border may create friction, and that periodic forceful engagements may occur. Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force. This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nthat the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), $^{134}$ Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), $^{135}$ Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), $^{136}$ Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), $^{137}$ Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), $^{138}$ Liberia (against Guinea), $^{139}$ and Sudan (against Chad). $^{140}$ Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”$^{141}$ The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”$^{142}$ This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nseverity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks. This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals. While states should be able to respond to a series of attacks before they are carried out entirely, there\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.” The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence. While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. . . . The most important object . . . is to . . . restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.” Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit. In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative\n Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nconcerns of the states.\" With the growing disconnect between the \"shorthand\" and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve. Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack\" that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks \"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\" Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope\n *Id.* at 604.\n *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences . . . drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation. The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality. Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves. Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51. As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nStates can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.” A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law. It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system. By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem\nPerhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532. (“It moreover seems illusory to think that simply denying this right would remove the threat of escalation.”)\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nphysical weapons to determine the country of origin. Cyber-attacks come out of the shadows, with their paths often being obscured through rerouted and masked IP addresses. It is often only after time has passed that it becomes clear where the attack originated from, and even years later there may be no definite answer. This problem has led many to criticize expanding Article 51 self-defense to cover responses to cyber-attacks. The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict. If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from. A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a \"honeypot\" in place to detect and identify\n It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending \"anonymous\" soldiers into another country to conduct operations. An example of this is the 2014 events in Crimea, where Russia sent unmarked troops in to Ukrainian territory. Alberto Riva, Russia's Use Of Unmarked Troops In Simferopol, Crimea, INT'L BUS.

This type of tracking is already making itself apparent. In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks. Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers. The ability to accurately attribute the source of cyber-attacks is likely to improve as technology develops and as countries begin to funnel more resources into their cyber-capabilities.\nEven where an attack can be traced to a specific country of origin, the attack must be\n Id.\n See David E.

[2014]\nattributed to a state actor to trigger self-defense. This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals. For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible. Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to. This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n Michael N.

Alb.), 1949 I.C.J. 4 (Apr. 9).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntacitly accepts responsibility for the conduct. The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State . . . if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own” by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.\nIn the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility. Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan. When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N. Security Council condemned the Taliban for “allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism . . . and for\n International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the Int’l Law Comm’n, 53d Sess., Apr. 23-June 1, July 2-Aug. 10, 2001, U.N.

[2014]\n\nThis international norm provides guidance in analysis of cyber-attacks. The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks, a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations. Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber-\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm. A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution. As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to\n *Id.* at 32-33.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks. Specifically, this Paper considers cyber-attacks to\n† Yale Law School, J.D. expected 2015; The Pennsylvania State University, B.A. 2012.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information. In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time. Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur, a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces, and discussions within\n Todd C.

For instance, China is aggressively increasing its cyber-potential, and has even begun to actively train university students in cyberwarfare. Similarly, since 2010 the North Korean government has been training thousands of computer science students on how to conduct cyber warfare. This has resulted in an increase in cyber-attacks coming from North Korea targeted at the United States and South Korea. The most high profile of these attacks came in late November 2014, when hackers broke into Sony Pictures’ computers through a string of cyberattacks.

Simply put, quantum computers are machines that operate in a fundamentally different manner than classic computers, and will be able to process information differently, allowing for capabilities outside classical computing. Although intense research and development in making practical quantum computers has been ongoing for decades, the current offerings are too expensive for anyone but large corporations. Developments in this field are ongoing, and the NSA is investigating quantum computing’s potential to hack nearly all standard cryptographic technology.

Two areas are of particular concern for U.S. national security: the national fuel supply infrastructure and power grid. These have been criticized for being susceptible to a well-designed cyber-attack, and present appealing targets to malicious hackers wishing to cause crippling harm to the country. As the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence put it, \"[i]f someone was trying to shut down our power grid when there is a huge polar vortex blowing through the country, that would have a serious impact on us.\"\nThe response of major countries and the international community has essentially been to do nothing.

This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm. States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important\n See, e.g., John T.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks\nAs the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhat they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war. In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort. The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization, where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber-\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nattacks, the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks. The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon. A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects. A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities . . . was not contemplated by the drafters . . . does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Application of the laws of war is further complicated by the fact that the effects of cyber-attacks are often reversible, and that immediate attribution as to the source of the attack is often nearly impossible. In combination, these characteristics make cyber-attacks a unique use of force and complicate the *jus ad bellum* analysis.\nThese novel features of cyber attacks, render the currently accepted definitions of “force” and “armed attack” insufficient to confront the growing threat of cyber-attacks. Academics have confronted this problem head-on, acknowledging that “[g]iven the rising threat of cyber attacks as a weapon of warfare, it will be necessary to develop a coherent analytical framework under jus ad bellum.” The major questions that a new framework must answer, and that this Paper confronts, are: 1) When do cyber activities amount to a threat or use of force under Article 2(4); and 2)\n The first Internet worm, the Morris worm, was intended to simply map out the scope of the Internet. Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.*\n *Id.* at 1103.\n *Id.* at 1104.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach. The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three\n See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napproaches that the Tallinn Manual either adopted or discarded (instrument-, target-, and effects-based), before turning to the Tallinn Manual itself. This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery. This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense. The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nnuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity. Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account. Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework. Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n Id.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model. This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense. Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources. This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach. The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\noverbroad. Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges. However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity. As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014]\narising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries. Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual. As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences. Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force. The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n *Id.*\n *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nwhether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack. Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach. Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s\n Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n\n See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nconsequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors. Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach. His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nDespite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry. Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.” Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.\nReese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n Daniel B.

Nguyen argues that Schmitt’s factors are too “malleable,” leading to limited effective utility for state leaders.\nNguyen further argues that this sort of effects-based analysis is ineffective, as different states will have different capabilities for detecting and mitigating cyber attacks. For instance, China, the United States, and North Korea could all suffer entirely different effects from the same cyber attack. China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack. On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense\n The U.N.

[2014]\n\nA useful analogy is to imagine a country (Country A) with a highly effective missile shield. Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual. Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nIn the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70\nWhile the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nTallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches\nSeveral other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\narmed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74\nNguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nimmediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council. This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China. Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nstrong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\ncountermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness. As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased. Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.\nFrom a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the\n International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001)\n Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntarget state. $^{85}$ Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. $^{86}$ In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice\nAs has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof each of the leading frameworks, and none of the “alternate” solutions is sufficient to cover the problems that cyber-attacks present to *jus ad bellum*. Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack. Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States\n See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack . . . if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nhas taken. Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world. The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ndamage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nThis first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nSecond, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nsituation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nthe right to use all necessary means . . . in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.\nAs a leading country in the international scene, and the largest target of cyber-attacks, the United States has set the example for what conduct countries will tolerate, and when they will resort to self-defense. A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account\nHaving identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .” In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem, this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n Discussed below in section III (c).\n See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nnexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^[104]\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n# B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ncountries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack. This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a\n See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27) (considering whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”); *Oil Platforms*, (Iran v. U.S.), Judgment, 2003 I.C.J. 161 (Nov. 6) (considering whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”).\n John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, N.Y. TIMES, Aug. 12, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html (“You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to” (quoting Bill Woodcock)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nspecific military or strategic resource can be inferred to have the intent of undermining the target country's sovereign power. Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\napproach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system. In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nhas been interpreted through state practice.” International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.” Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .” This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III. Anticipated Criticism\nAny novel proposal of change to a conventional interpretation of international law can\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 73.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 21 (quoting Arbitration regarding the Iron Rhine Railway (Belgium v.

[2014]\nanticipate criticism. Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nThe commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold. These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.” This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.” Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.\nThinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’” Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of\n Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

[2014]\nthe attack. Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British. Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden, the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air\n *Id.* at 157.\n *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, at 2, 3 April 1964, § 3 (UK).\n A British colony until 1963.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nattacks . . . carried out in spite of protests and warnings.” Although the U.N. Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive. This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War, the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon, and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others. Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no\n U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n See, e.g., U.N. Doc. S/PV .1108, 6 April 1964, at §§ 32-5 (Morocco), 48-50 (Ivory Coast).\n (1967) UNYB 175.\n (1968) UNYB 191.\n (2006) UNYB 498.\n (1999) 45 Keesing’s 42955.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\npoint was there any suggestion that China could consider the event an “armed attack” justifying self-defense. This may seem intuitive, but it is worth pointing out that the underlying reason was that there was no aggressive intent.\nTaken together, these examples demonstrate that: first, absent *de minimis* intensity, events can still be justifiably considered armed attacks based on their aggressive intent; and, second, that events crossing the *de minimis* threshold may not trigger Article 51, absent aggressive intent. This analysis enforces this Paper’s contention that the conventional “use of force” and “armed attack” focus on physical violence was selected merely as a proxy for which to identify other policies that the drafters of the Charter wished to further and protect – in this case, preventing aggressive actions between countries.\nAdditionally, this provides a satisfactory explanation of why minor border skirmishes are generally not considered to be armed attacks. Rather than explaining these events as simply not crossing the *de minimis* threshold, it makes more sense to explain that border skirmishes carry a rebuttable presumption of a lack of aggressive\n Ruys, *supra* note 86, at 165.\n “In the end, the Definition of Aggression, the case law of the ICJ and customary practice provide credible indications that hostile intent is a relevant factor for determining whether an ‘armed attack’ has occurred.” *Id.* at 166.\n See Hathaway et al, *supra* note 22 (“The ICJ has indicated that cross-border incursions that are minor in their ‘scale and effects’ may be classified as mere ‘frontier incident[s]’ rather than ‘armed attacks.’” (quoting Nicaragua)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nintent. It is generally to be expected that the situation on a border may create friction, and that periodic forceful engagements may occur. Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force. This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nthat the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), $^{134}$ Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), $^{135}$ Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), $^{136}$ Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), $^{137}$ Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), $^{138}$ Liberia (against Guinea), $^{139}$ and Sudan (against Chad). $^{140}$ Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”$^{141}$ The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”$^{142}$ This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nseverity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks. This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals. While states should be able to respond to a series of attacks before they are carried out entirely, there\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.” The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence. While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. . . . The most important object . . . is to . . . restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\napparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.” Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit. In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative\n Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nconcerns of the states.\" With the growing disconnect between the \"shorthand\" and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve. Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack\" that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks \"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\" Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope\n *Id.* at 604.\n *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences . . . drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nof Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation. The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality. Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves. Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51. As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\nStates can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.” A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law. It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system. By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem\nPerhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n Ruys, supra note 86, at 532. (“It moreover seems illusory to think that simply denying this right would remove the threat of escalation.”)\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\nphysical weapons to determine the country of origin. Cyber-attacks come out of the shadows, with their paths often being obscured through rerouted and masked IP addresses. It is often only after time has passed that it becomes clear where the attack originated from, and even years later there may be no definite answer. This problem has led many to criticize expanding Article 51 self-defense to cover responses to cyber-attacks. The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict. If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from. A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a \"honeypot\" in place to detect and identify\n It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending \"anonymous\" soldiers into another country to conduct operations.

This type of tracking is already making itself apparent. In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks. Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers. The ability to accurately attribute the source of cyber-attacks is likely to improve as technology develops and as countries begin to funnel more resources into their cyber-capabilities.\nEven where an attack can be traced to a specific country of origin, the attack must be\n Id.\n See David E.

[2014]\nattributed to a state actor to trigger self-defense. This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals. For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible. Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to. This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n Michael N.

The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State . . . if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own” by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.\nIn the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility. Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan. When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N. Security Council condemned the Taliban for “allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism . . . and for\n International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the Int’l Law Comm’n, 53d Sess., Apr. 23-June 1, July 2-Aug. 10, 2001, U.N.

[2014]\n\nThis international norm provides guidance in analysis of cyber-attacks. The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks, a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations. Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber-\n Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm. A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World... [2014]\n\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution. As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to\n *Id.* at 32-33.\n Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n[2014]\ntolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks.

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information.¹ In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time.² Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur,³ a \"cyber-war\" between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces,⁴ and discussions within\n¹ Todd C.

For instance, China is aggressively increasing its cyber-potential, and has even begun to actively train university students in cyberwarfare.⁶ Similarly, since 2010 the North Korean government has been training thousands of computer science students on how to conduct cyber warfare.⁷ This has resulted in an increase in cyber-attacks coming from North Korea targeted at the United States and South Korea.⁸ The most high profile of these attacks came in late November 2014, when hackers broke into Sony Pictures’ computers through a string of cyberattacks.⁹ The hackers “wiped out Sony computers,” leaked private emails, and\n⁵ David E.

This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸ States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important\n¹⁸ See, e.g., John T. Parry, *What is the Grotian Tradition in International Law*, 35 U. P.A. J.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a \"pure-cyber-attack.\" By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks\nAs the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nwhat they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War\nThe past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war.¹⁹ In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort.²⁰ The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally,\n¹⁹ Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n²⁰ Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nthe United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization,²¹ where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . . .”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber-\n²¹ U.N. Charter art. 42.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nattacks,²² the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law\nLooking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks.²³ The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon.²⁴ A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects.²⁵ A virus intended to target a specific set of systems\n²² See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n²³ See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities . . . was not contemplated by the drafters . . . does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n²⁴ Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.*\n²⁷ *Id.* at 1103.\n²⁸ *Id.* at 1104.\n²⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n³⁰ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n53\nwhen does such force constitute an armed attack under Article 51?³¹\nIn response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach.³² The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three\n³¹ See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n³² TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\napproaches that the Tallinn Manual either adopted or discarded (instrument-, target-, and effects-based), before turning to the Tallinn Manual itself. This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The \"Instrument-Based\" Approach\nOne approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery.³³ This is commonly referred to as the \"instrument-based\" approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense.³⁴ The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of \"weapons\" as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons,\n³³ Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n³⁴ Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nnuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity.³⁵ Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account.³⁶ Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework.³⁷ Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach\n³⁵ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n³⁶ Id.\n³⁷ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nThe second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model.³⁸ This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense.³⁹ Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources.⁴⁰ This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach.⁴¹ The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”⁴² Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously\n³⁸ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n³⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n⁴⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n⁴¹ See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10 (May 2011), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n⁴² Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\noverbroad.⁴³ Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges.⁴⁴ However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity.⁴⁵ As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war\n⁴³ See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n⁴⁴ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\narising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries.⁴⁶ Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach\nThe third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual.⁴⁷ As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences.⁴⁸ Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force.⁴⁹ The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining\n⁴⁶ *Id.*\n⁴⁷ *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n⁴⁸ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n⁴⁹ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nwhether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”⁵⁰\nMichael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack.⁵¹ Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach.⁵² Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack⁵³; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”⁵⁴). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s\n⁵⁰ Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n⁵¹ 76 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES: COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACK AND INTERNATIONAL LAW (Michael N.

Rev. 569 (2011).\n⁵² See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n⁵³ Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nconsequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors.⁵⁵ Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach.⁵⁶ His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n⁵⁵ Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n⁵⁶ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nDespite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry.⁵⁷ Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.”⁵⁸ Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.⁵⁹\nReese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was\n⁵⁷ See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n⁵⁸ Daniel B.

China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack.⁶³ On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense\n⁶⁰ The U.N.

Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual.⁶⁵ Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n⁶⁴ Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n⁶⁵ TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nIn the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70\nWhile the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nTallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches\nSeveral other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered\n71 Michael N. Schmitt, International Law in Cyberspace The Koh Speech and Tallinn Manual Juxtaposed, 54 HARV. INT’L. L.J. 13 (2012) (“Uncertainty as to what those scale and effects are plagued the Tallinn Manual deliberations”).\n72 Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1125.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\narmed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74\nNguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of\n73 Id.\n74 Id. at 1127.\n75 See, e.g., Statement of General Keith B. Alexander, Commander United States Cyber Command, Committee on Senate Armed Services, Feb. 27, 2014; http://www.digitalattackmap.com/ provides a real-time global map of current cyber attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nimmediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered \"armed attacks\" under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council⁷⁶ have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council.⁷⁷ This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China.⁷⁸ Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto\n⁷⁶ The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n⁷⁷ Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nstrong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of\n79 See, e.g., id. at 582.\n80 Report of the International Law Commission, 53d Sess., U.N. Doc. A/56/10; GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10 (2001).\n81 Michael N. Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law, Forthcoming 54 VA. J, OF INT’L L. 6 (2014).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\ncountermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness.⁸² As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased.⁸³ Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.⁸⁴\nFrom a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the\n⁸² International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001)\n⁸³ Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n⁸⁴ Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\ntarget state. $^{85}$ Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. $^{86}$ In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n71\nneed to be careful that its responses did not amount to a use of force, something that can be quite difficult to predict. While in traditional cases it would be simple to determine the effects of a countermeasure, in the digital age “there is no guarantee that . . . reciprocal tactics will produce a reciprocal effect.”87\nFor example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice\nAs has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state\n87 Katharine C. Hinkle, *Countermeasures in the Cyber Context One More Thing to Worry About*, 37 Yale J. of Int’l Law Online 11, 20 (Fall 2011).\n88 *Id.* at 21.\n89 U.N.

Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack.⁹⁰ Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack . . . if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nhas taken.⁹¹ Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”⁹²\nLooking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world.⁹³ The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical\n⁹¹ International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n⁹² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n⁹³ Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\ndamage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nThis first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n94 This proposition is supported by the rational choice theory of international law compliance. See generally, Andrew Guzman, How International Law Works (2008); Jeremy Lawrence, Treaty Violations, Section 1983, and International Law Theory, 16 SW. J. INT'L L. 1 (2010) (“Rational choice theories of international law assume that nation-states act in a way best calculated to achieve their objectives. Decisions about whether to act unilaterally or cooperatively in compliance with treaties and customary norms, or in violation of treaties and norms, are made according to calculations about the decisions’ likely costs and benefits.”).\n95 Indeed, the United States has repeatedly emphasized its intent to continue developing offensive cyber capabilities, and has not hesitated to commit the use of those weapons to defend national interests. In March 2014, the United States announced its intent to substantially increase its Cyber Command division, in an attempt to “ensure[] the security of the United States and critical infrastructure.” Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Cyberwarfare Force to Grow Significantly, Defense Secretary Says,”Wash. Post, Mar. 28, 2014.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nSecond, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nsituation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC. All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nthe right to use all necessary means . . . in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.¹⁰⁰\nAs a leading country in the international scene, and the largest target of cyber-attacks, the United States has set the example for what conduct countries will tolerate, and when they will resort to self-defense. A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account\nHaving identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n¹⁰⁰ *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n# A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context\nFirst, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state . . .”¹⁰¹ In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem,¹⁰² this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.¹⁰³\nSecond, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical\n¹⁰¹ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n¹⁰² Discussed below in section III (c).\n¹⁰³ See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nnexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n# B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context\nHaving defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure.¹⁰⁵ Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that\nhosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n¹⁰⁵ Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\ncountries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their \"sovereign or strategic power\" is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n83\nwould be singly sufficient to constitute an armed attack. In itself, this type of attack would fundamentally impair the target country's strategic power by significantly disrupting its military infrastructure. As such, the target country would be justified in using self-defense.\nIn the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack.¹⁰⁶ This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.¹⁰⁷\nNearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a\n¹⁰⁶ See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27) (considering whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”); *Oil Platforms*, (Iran v. U.S.), Judgment, 2003 I.C.J. 161 (Nov. 6) (considering whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”).\n¹⁰⁷ John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, N.Y. TIMES, Aug. 12, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html (“You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to” (quoting Bill Woodcock)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nspecific military or strategic resource can be inferred to have the intent of undermining the target country's sovereign power. Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework\nLooking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\napproach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system.¹⁰⁸ In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nhas been interpreted through state practice.”¹⁰⁹ International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.”¹¹⁰ Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom . . .”¹¹¹ This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III. Anticipated Criticism\nAny novel proposal of change to a conventional interpretation of international law can\n¹⁰⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 73.\n¹¹⁰ Ruys, supra note 86, at 21 (quoting Arbitration regarding the Iron Rhine Railway (Belgium v.

Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens\nThe most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack,\" scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nThe commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold.¹¹² These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.”¹¹³ This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.”¹¹⁴ Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.¹¹⁵\nThinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’”¹¹⁶ Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of\n¹¹² Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).¹¹⁷\ni. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent”\nThe aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).¹¹⁸\nFor example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British.¹¹⁹ Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden,¹²⁰ the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air\n¹¹⁷ *Id.* at 157.\n¹¹⁸ *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n¹¹⁹ U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, at 2, 3 April 1964, § 3 (UK).\n¹²⁰ A British colony until 1963.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nattacks . . . carried out in spite of protests and warnings.”¹²¹ Although the U.N. Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive.¹²² This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War,¹²³ the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon,¹²⁴ and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.¹²⁵\nConversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others.¹²⁶ Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no\n¹²¹ U.N. Doc. S/PV .1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n¹²² See, e.g., U.N. Doc.

Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.¹³¹\n## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis\nAn additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force.¹³² This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.¹³³\nIndeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion\n¹³⁰ Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n¹³¹ See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n¹³² Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹³³ Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nthat the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), $^{134}$ Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), $^{135}$ Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), $^{136}$ Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), $^{137}$ Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), $^{138}$ Liberia (against Guinea), $^{139}$ and Sudan (against Chad). $^{140}$ Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”$^{141}$ The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of . . . attacks’ . . . can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”$^{142}$ This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nseverity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.¹⁴³\nThis concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks.¹⁴⁴ This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.¹⁴⁵\n¹⁴³ Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n¹⁴⁴ Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹⁴⁵ Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals. While states should be able to respond to a series of attacks before they are carried out entirely, there\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence\nHaving analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.”¹⁴⁶ The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence.¹⁴⁷ Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence.¹⁴⁸ While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes\nshould be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n¹⁴⁶ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n¹⁴⁷ In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n¹⁴⁸ See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. . . . The most important object . . . is to . . . restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\napparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence . . . with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.”¹⁴⁹ Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.¹⁵⁰\nSo why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit.¹⁵¹ In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative\n¹⁴⁹ Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n¹⁵⁰ Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n¹⁵¹ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\nconcerns of the states.\"¹⁵² With the growing disconnect between the \"shorthand\" and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve.¹⁵³ Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of \"use of force\" and \"armed attack\" that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although \"kinetic force\" itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the \"de minimis\" test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks \"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\"¹⁵⁴ Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope\n¹⁵² *Id.* at 604.\n¹⁵³ *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences . . . drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n¹⁵⁴ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nof Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation\nA second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation.¹⁵⁵ The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality.¹⁵⁶ Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves.¹⁵⁷ Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope\n¹⁵⁵ See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n¹⁵⁶ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁵⁷ Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n99\nof Article 51 to cover some “pure-cyber” attacks (attacks with no physical effect), states responding to such attacks would have a heavy burden to respond to such attacks using cyber-responses. These strict requirements of necessity and proportionality would regulate the types of responses engaged in by states, and limit the threat of escalation.\nFor example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51.¹⁵⁸ As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n¹⁵⁸ By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\nStates can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.”¹⁵⁹ A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law.¹⁶⁰ It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system.¹⁶¹ By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem\nPerhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no\n¹⁵⁹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁶⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n¹⁶¹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.

The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict.¹⁶⁵ If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from.¹⁶⁶ A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a \"honeypot\" in place to detect and identify\n¹⁶² It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending \"anonymous\" soldiers into another country to conduct operations.

In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks.¹⁶⁸ Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).¹⁶⁹ Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers.¹⁷⁰ The ability to accurately attribute the source of cyber-attacks is likely to improve as technology develops and as countries begin to funnel more resources into their cyber-capabilities.¹⁷¹\nEven where an attack can be traced to a specific country of origin, the attack must be\n¹⁶⁷ Id.\n¹⁶⁸ See David E.

This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals.¹⁷² For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible.¹⁷³ Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to.¹⁷⁴ This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁷⁵ By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state\n¹⁷² Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n¹⁷³ Michael N.

The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State . . . if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own”¹⁷⁶ by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.¹⁷⁷\nIn the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility.¹⁷⁸ Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan.¹⁷⁹ When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N. Security Council condemned the Taliban for “allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism . . . and for\n¹⁷⁶ International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the Int’l Law Comm’n, 53d Sess., Apr. 23-June 1, July 2-Aug. 10, 2001, U.N.

The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks,¹⁸² a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations.¹⁸³ Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber-\n¹⁸⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n¹⁸¹ David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion\nIn this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸⁵ A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and\n¹⁸⁴ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks . . . will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n¹⁸⁵ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nA Brave New World...\n107\nproviding for a governing system through the U.N. Charter.¹⁸⁶\nThe current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution.¹⁸⁷ As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to\n¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 32-33.\n¹⁸⁷ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nJournal of Law and Cyber Warfare\n\ntolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Every day, countries around the world are the targets of countless cyber-attacks. As early as 1998, the United States Department of Defense was a regular target of malicious cyber-attacks attempting to gain access to strategic servers and information.¹ In one such attack, several terabytes of design and systems information on the Air Force's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were accessed, and the hackers gained access to Air Force air traffic control, allowing them to view the location of Air Force jets in real time.² Since that time, the prevalence and intensity of cyber-attacks has grown. The first few months of 2014 alone saw the single-largest cyber-attack occur,³ a\"cyber-war\"between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian forces,⁴ and discussions within ¹ Todd C.

[2014] response the United States will take against North Korea for the November 2014 Sony Pictures attacks). This situation is not unprecedented in international relations; prior to the twentieth century, under the Grotian theory of international relations, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸ States could declare war on other states with impunity, for almost any reason. With no international agreement barring acts of war, conflicts ran rampant and the human casualty rate skyrocketed, culminating in World War I. Today’s reality of cyberwarfare is akin to those dark days of international affairs: state and nonstate actors can reach across the Internet and inflict massive chaos and disorder with no fear of retaliation. Until the international community speaks out against these attacks, as they did in the Twentieth Century against classic warfare, the cyberattacks will continue.\nThis Paper confronts the implications of this modern arms race and examines the application of the international laws of war to cyber-attacks. The two major questions that must be answered for any new method or technology of war are: 1) when does the U.N. Charter consider conduct to be a “use of force”, and 2) when does that use of force amount to an “armed attack,” justifying self-defense? While some scholars have advocated applying the laws of war to cyber-attacks, none of their approaches adequately acknowledge the important ¹⁸ See, e.g., John T. Parry, *What is the Grotian Tradition in International Law*, 35 U. P.A. J.

This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of jus ad bellum, and developing modern norms. Part I lays out the relevant laws of war, and examines approaches that have been put forth as frameworks under which to analyze cyber-attacks, ultimately concluding that none of the approaches is satisfactory. Part II lays out this Paper's proposed framework, which considers cyber-attacks that significantly disrupt a country's military, critical, or strategic infrastructure to be armed attacks. Unlike previously proposed frameworks, this framework would potentially classify a cyber-attack as an armed attack even absent any physical damage – a\"pure-cyber-attack.\"By analyzing cyber-attacks this way, this framework reflects the types of analyses and responses that states will engage in. Part III anticipates criticisms of this Paper's proposal, and demonstrates why the proposal is consistent with the underlying principles of the U.N. Charter.\n## I. Applying Jus Ad Bellum to Cyber Attacks As the most authoritative codification of international law, determining how the U.N. Charter applies to state conduct is vastly important in the modern world. Although several scholars have attempted to apply the UN's rules to cyber-attacks, none of these analyses have been satisfactory because they reflect a growing disconnect between This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] what they would condemn or allow, and how states increasingly analyze and respond to cyber-conduct in the digital age.\n## A. The Development of International Law of War The past three centuries have seen a fundamental restructuring of international opinions of war and use of force. In the eighteenth century, states believed that the only legal requirement for going to war was to make a manifesto/declaration of war.¹⁹ In the absence of an international governmental framework, the only way to resolve disputes was through war. These wars could be triggered by things as benign as unpaid debts (e.g., the U.S. – Mexico war), and were considered perfectly legitimate. In an attempt to limit and regulate wars, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the arrival of customary international law that perceived war as a means of last resort.²⁰ The concepts of *jus ad bellum* (international law governing when a state could go to war) and *jus in bello* (international law governing a state’s conduct once in a war) were solidified over the twentieth century through the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter.\nThe concept of *jus ad bellum* is codified in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the U.N. Charter. Generally, ¹⁹ Beomchul Shin, International Law and the Use of Force: Shaping the UN Charter and Its Evolution, 120 (KIDA Press, 2008).\n²⁰ Shin, *supra* note 19, at 123.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] the United Nations is a system that prohibits the use of force by one state on another. Article 2(4) states that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” This general prohibition has limited exceptions, including U.N. Security Council authorization,²¹ where consent has been obtained from the country on the receiving end of the force, and where a state acts in self-defense. This last exception, acting in self-defense, is codified in Article 51 of the Charter, and holds that: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...”\nAs new weapons and methods of force are invented, the Charter’s provisions for jus ad bellum are pushed to their limits, and their definitions are challenged and questioned. Nowhere is this clearer than in the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. While the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned the digital age we live in and the potential for cyber-attacks, it is clear that international law should cover the use of cyber-weapons. While there are many questions concerning the application of jus in bello to cyber- ²¹ U.N. Charter art. 42.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] attacks,²² the focus of this Paper is on the application of *jus ad bellum* and how cyber-attacks fit into the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51.\n## B. Fitting Cyber Attacks Into International Law Looking at *jus ad bellum*'s scope, it is generally accepted that this fundamental law of war should (and does) apply to cyber-attacks.²³ The question is not whether *jus ad bellum* applies, but how to apply it. This application is made difficult given the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are quite unlike anything to which the laws of war have previously been applied. Certain features make cyber-attacks both novel in their uses, and difficult in their application to the laws of war. For instance, cyber-attacks have the potential to cause a much broader scope of effects than any previously utilized weapon.²⁴ A single virus, worm, or botnet could potentially infect and harm millions, if not billions, of computers and impact a significant portion of the world's population. Additionally, cyber-attacks are unpredictable in their effects.²⁵ A virus intended to target a specific set of systems ²² See, e.g., Oona A. Hathaway et al, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, 100 CAL. L. REV. 817, 850 (2012).\n²³ See, e.g., Walter Gary Sharp, Sr., *CYBERSPACE AND THE USE OF FORCE 5* (1999) (“It now seems almost universally accepted that a considerable body of international law does indeed apply to the use of force by states in CyberSpace.”); Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 21 (“The fact that cyber attack capabilities... was not contemplated by the drafters... does not place those activities outside the application of *jus in bello*.”).\n²⁴ Reese Nguyen, *Navigating Jus Ad Bellum in the Age of Cyber Warfare*, 101 CALIF.

Due to a coding error, it replicated much faster than anticipated and resulted in a DoS attack on the Internet (a DoS attack is a Denial of Service attack. In such an attack, the attacker floods a target site or network with traffic, rendering the target inoperable). The same effect was seen with Stuxnet, a virus intended to target Iranian nuclear facilities but that spread to a much wider, international audience. *Id.* ²⁷ *Id.* at 1103.\n²⁸ *Id.* at 1104.\n²⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n³⁰ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1112.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] In response to these questions, three major approaches have been proposed as frameworks for analyzing cyber attacks under Articles 2(4) and 51: the instrument-based, target-based, and effects-based approaches. Additionally, several “solutions” have been proposed in an attempt to confront cyber-attacks through alternative means beyond Articles 2(4) and 51, such as through the U.N. Security Council and through countermeasures. Although each approach aims to satisfy a different policy rationale, each one falls short of adequately addressing the novel problems of cyber-attacks. In contrast, by combining the strengths of the target-based and effects-based approaches, this Paper proposes a framework that takes into account the developing policy considerations that states look at in the digital age. The current leading academic application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, the 2013 Tallinn Manual (discussed below), uses a mixed approach combining the target-based and effects-based approach, with emphasis on the effects-based approach.³² The Tallinn Manual is the consensus of leading international law experts as to the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks. The Tallinn Manual’s approach has been widely accepted; this Paper looks at the three ³¹ See, e.g., Sharp, supra note 23, at 11.\n³² TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] approaches that the Tallinn Manual either adopted or discarded (instrument-, target-, and effects-based), before turning to the Tallinn Manual itself. This Paper places more emphasis on the target-based approach than the Tallinn Manual does, and does not restrict its effects-based analysis to physical effects, a deviation from the Tallinn Manual's approach.\n## i. The\"Instrument-Based\"Approach One approach to analyzing the force of cyber attacks is to look at the method of delivery.³³ This is commonly referred to as the\"instrument-based\"approach. This framework would categorize cyber-attacks by the method through which an attack occurs. Some scholars argue that an attack can be an armed attack only if it uses conventional weapons, precluding a cyber attack's ever triggering self-defense.³⁴ The approach would differentiate attacks carried out by viruses, worms, network intrusions, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), etc. The instrument-based approach would categorize attacks utilizing certain types of\"weapons\"as armed attacks. This closely parallels some of the frameworks that cover other conventional weapons (e.g., chemical weapons, ³³ Michael Gervais, *Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War*, 30 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 525, 538 (2012); Duncan B. Hollis, *Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations*, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1041 (2007).\n³⁴ Hollis, *supra* note 33.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] nuclear weapons, etc.) and provides a familiar framework within which to interact.\nThis early approach has largely been discarded by scholars as an inappropriate way to measure cyber attacks. The commonly articulated problem with this type of analysis is its rigidity.³⁵ Although it is unclear what would be considered an attack under this framework, the inflexibility is inherent. This approach looks solely at the circumstances through which the attack is carried out, and ignores the consequences of the attack. A well-executed DDoS attack or virus could have significantly greater consequences than troops on the ground, and any effective analysis should take this into account.³⁶ Additionally, technology in the field of cyber-attacks is constantly changing, which poses a significant impediment to this type of framework.³⁷ Were countries to pass a treaty condemning certain types of cyber weapons (similarly to the nuclear and chemical weapons treaties), new technology and forms of cyber warfare could very well exist before ratification or execution. As such, a framework looking solely at the type of weapon employed is inappropriate in the context of cyber weapons.\nii. The “Target-Based” Approach ³⁵ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1118.\n³⁶ Id.\n³⁷ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] The second framework suggested is a strict liability, or “target-based” model.³⁸ This model would categorize attacks based on the target of the attack, and define any attack on a critical infrastructure as an attack warranting self-defense.³⁹ Advocates of this approach argue that a sovereign nation has an extremely strong interest in protecting certain critical resources.⁴⁰ This interest, combined with the potential destructive nature of cyber-attacks warrants immediate self-defense. It is unclear exactly what would be defined as critical infrastructure, although the United States seems to endorse this approach.⁴¹ The United States has defined critical infrastructure to mean “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”⁴² Proponents of this framework laud its ease of administration: any attack on a critical infrastructure is easily classified as an attack justifying self-defense.\nThis approach, however, has been widely criticized and dismissed as being dangerously ³⁸ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1119.\n³⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 129-31.\n⁴⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 538.\n⁴¹ See The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World 10, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf.\n⁴² Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e) (2006).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] overbroad.⁴³ Similarly to the instrument-based approach, this approach does not take into account the consequences of cyber activity. Any cyber activity targeted at critical infrastructure (whether or not successful or harmful) would immediately warrant defensive measures. This approach infers hostile intent on the part of the aggressor computer, which may not always be true. The critical infrastructure system may not even be the target of the attack.\nFor instance, in the Stuxnet attack, the virus was programmed to cause damage only to Iranian nuclear centrifuges.⁴⁴ However, the program spread faster than anticipated and infected millions of computers. Although there was no chance of causing any damage to any computers not connected to the Iranian centrifuges, under a target-based approach countries could have responded in force if “critical” systems were infected.\nAdditionally, the definition of certain systems as “critical infrastructure” is problematic. The United States has defined sixteen major categories, which are sufficiently broad as to cover nearly all government or commercial activity.⁴⁵ As U.S. government and commercial networks are the targets of cyber attacks on a daily basis, the result of a target-based approach would be instant war ⁴³ See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1120; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 846.\n⁴⁴ Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1102.\n⁴⁵ Id. at 1121.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] arising out of any cyber activity. It is unlikely that countries would agree to this type of framework, given the extensive programs of cyber espionage being conducted by leading countries.⁴⁶ Therefore, a target-based approach is not the best framework under which to analyze cyber-attacks.\n### iii. The “Effects-Based” Approach The third approach that has been put forward is the “effects-based” approach. This is currently accepted as the best of the possible approaches, and is relied on heavily by the Tallinn Manual.⁴⁷ As such, it is worth examining the proposed framework and the variants that scholars have put forth. Although the effects-based approach is a step in the right direction, it has not been immune from criticism and is not an adequate comprehensive framework.\nGenerally, the effects-based approach classifies a cyber-attack based on the gravity of its consequences.⁴⁸ Where the effects of a cyber attack equal those of a conventional, kinetic attack, states may treat the cyber attack as such and respond with force.⁴⁹ The remaining question is what threshold and metrics should be applied in determining ⁴⁶ *Id.* ⁴⁷ *See, e.g.,* Hathaway et al., *supra* note 22, at 847 (“Steering a middle course between the instrument- and target-based views, the effects-based approach is the most promising and most widely accepted approach.”).\n⁴⁸ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 24.\n⁴⁹ Nguyen, *supra* note 24, at 1122.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] whether an attack’s effects are sufficient to be considered a use of force or armed attack. Currently, it is widely acknowledged that for cyber-attacks to qualify under this framework, they must produce “physical destruction akin to that produced by a kinetic attack.”⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt has proposed an effects-based framework that looks to six criteria in determining whether a cyber-attack crosses the threshold as an armed attack.⁵¹ Scholars generally regard this approach as the leading interpretation of the effects-based framework, and the authors of the Tallinn Manual (led by Schmitt) largely adopted his approach.⁵² Schmitt’s six criteria are: 1) Severity of the attack⁵³; 2) Immediacy of the attack (how soon the consequences manifest); 3) Directness (the causal connection between an attack and its effects); 4) Invasiveness (how secure the targeted system is); 5) Measurability (how quantifiable the effects of an attack are); 6) Presumptive legitimacy (whether an attack is of a type that is generally lawful – e.g., “propaganda, psychological warfare, or espionage”⁵⁴). Based on these criteria, a state would determine whether a cyber attack’s ⁵⁰ Id.; Hathaway et al, supra note 22, at 848.\n⁵¹ 76 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES: COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACK AND INTERNATIONAL LAW (Michael N.

Rev. 569 (2011).\n⁵² See, e.g., Nguyen, supra note 24, at 1122; Hathaway et al., supra note 22, at 847.\n⁵³ Schmitt notes that this is “self-evidently the most significant factor in the analysis.” Schmitt, supra note 51, at 576.\n⁵⁴ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] consequences are sufficient to warrant a response in self-defense.\nIn a defense of his approach, prior to the publication of the Tallinn Manual, Schmitt continues to advocate for his factors.⁵⁵ Schmitt argues that states will generally be motivated to strike a middle ground between setting the threshold for what constitutes a use of force too high (potentially inviting other states to engage in aggressive conduct without fear of being accused of violating Article 2(4)), and setting the threshold too low (limiting one’s freedom of action out of fear that seemingly benign conduct will be considered an illegal use of force). To Schmitt, these factors allow states to assess when a state’s conduct is no longer tolerable and crosses the line to become a use of force.\nSchmitt uses the case of the Estonian cyber attacks as a validation of the utility of his approach.⁵⁶ His analysis of the Estonia attacks under the framework demonstrates that the events amounted to a use of force. The consequences were severe (throwing the economy into turmoil), immediate, direct, invasive, difficult to quantify (the only one of Schmitt’s factors cutting against his argument), and not presumptively legitimate. As such, Schmitt argues that his analysis is of continuing use.\n⁵⁵ Id. at 575 (“The approach has generally withstood the test of time.”).\n⁵⁶ Id. at 577.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] Despite being the leading approach, Schmitt’s framework and the effects-based analysis, generally, have not escaped criticism. The major contention with the Schmitt analysis is that it gives little substantive guidance, instead advocating for a largely subjective case-by-case inquiry.⁵⁷ Defining the analysis by using broad factors allows easy manipulation of the inquiry, and “virtually any [cyber attack] can be argued to fall on the armed force side of the line.”⁵⁸ Particularly problematic is the absence of any description as to how the factors should be weighed against themselves.⁵⁹ Reese Nguyen illustrates this point by turning Schmitt’s Estonia analysis around on itself. She demonstrates that the factors can easily be used to frame the Estonia attacks as falling short of constituting a use of force, the opposite of what Schmitt concluded: (1) The attacks were not severe because no one was injured, no property was damaged, and DDoS attacks caused temporary disruption; (2) the consequences of the DDoS attacks (loss of confidence in government, lost business revenue from disabled websites) were not direct but were delayed; (3) the damage was not a direct result of the DDoS attacks, but an indirect result of the consequences; (4) invasiveness was ⁵⁷ See, e.g., Hathaway et. al, supra note 22 (“These factors are illuminating, but they call for such a wide-ranging inquiry that they may not provide sufficient guidance to decision makers.”).\n⁵⁸ Daniel B. Silver, Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, in COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACK AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 73, 80–82 (Michael N. Schmitt &amp; Brian T. O’Donnell eds., 2002).\n⁵⁹ Gervais, supra note 33, at 541.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] minimal, as the attacks were executed remotely with no direct penetration; (5) the consequences were difficult to quantify (which Schmitt would agree with); (6) the attacks were limited to telecommunications systems, making them presumptively legitimate.⁶⁰ Nguyen argues that Schmitt’s factors are too “malleable,” leading to limited effective utility for state leaders.⁶¹ Nguyen further argues that this sort of effects-based analysis is ineffective, as different states will have different capabilities for detecting and mitigating cyber attacks.⁶² For instance, China, the United States, and North Korea could all suffer entirely different effects from the same cyber attack. China, with the capability to quickly sever the nation from the remainder of cyberspace, could quickly mitigate an attack. Similarly, North Korea, which relies much less on computer networks than most countries, would be relatively immune to the effects of an attack.⁶³ On the other hand, in the United States, where computer networks are largely privately owned and intricately interconnected with the country’s main strategic, economic, and defense ⁶⁰ The U.N. Charter does not consider disruption of communications to be a use of force. U.N.

[2014] A useful analogy is to imagine a country (Country A) with a highly effective missile shield. Under the effects-based test, if Country B launched a nuclear missile at Country A but the missile was neutralized by the missile shield, such an attack would not be considered an armed attack, and Country A could not respond in self-defense. Country B could continue launching missiles without Country A being legally allowed to respond with force, until one missile worked its way through the missile shield. In reality, however, no country would stand idly by while it was the target of a sustained missile campaign. As such, the effects-based test is not a useful framework for countries to employ.\nAny review of the literature covering cyber-attacks and the effects-based approach must acknowledge the Tallinn Manual.⁶⁵ Overseen by Michael Schmitt and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, the Tallinn Manual brought together twenty renowned international law scholars in an attempt to lay out the commonly accepted norms and definitions of international law as it applies to cyber-attacks. While this document is not binding, it is a good representation of the current state of the debate.\n⁶⁴ Id.; see also Gervais, supra note 33, at 556.\n⁶⁵ TALLIN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] In the context of the Use of Force and Self-Defense, the Manual lays out several definitions and conclusions. The Manual concludes that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.”66 The Manual also adopts Schmitt’s six-factor analysis for determining whether an attack constitutes a use of force.67 In looking at the threshold for an armed attack, the Manual holds that “[w]hether a cyber operation constitutes an armed attack depends on its scale and effects.”68 While this definition demonstrates the group’s commitment to the effects-based test, it does not provide an exact way to administer the test. Indeed, in the commentary to the Manual, it is conceded that “the parameters of the scale and effects criteria remain unsettled.”69 Further commentary reveals divided opinions, with the group of experts being unable to agree on several topics.70 While the Tallinn Manual represents one of the first true attempts to obtain a consensus on the application of the laws of war to cyber-attacks, where the questions of use of force and armed attacks are addressed, it falls short of providing meaningful standards that states can apply. The This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] Tallinn Manual demonstrates the current state of controversy surrounding the scope of international law over cyber-attacks, and the debate within the group of experts that prepared the Manual.71 While the Tallinn Manual is to be applauded for its efforts at clarifying the current consensus of the matter, the truth is that there is little consensus on the more important issues.\n## iv. Alternative Approaches Several other scholars have put forth alternative frameworks to analyze when self-defense is authorized based on a cyber attack. These approaches range from looking at the “cyber-physical” characteristics of a target, relying on the U.N. Security Council for responses to cyber-attacks, and responding to such attacks with countermeasures. Each of these approaches is either overbroad, too narrow, or impractical. Therefore, none of these satisfactorily answers the problems that cyber-attacks create in international law.\nFor instance, Reese Nguyen advocates a framework that is “administrable across nation-states, forward-looking, and both consistent and sensible in its treatment of cyber attacks.”72 Nguyen proposes that cyber-attacks be considered This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] armed attacks where “they are intended to cause irreversible disruption or physical damage to a cyber-physical system.”73 A cyber-physical system is a computer system controlling a physical process. Nguyen’s analysis is based on the premise that “cyber attacks that do not threaten or result in physical effects should not constitute force under the jus ad bellum, because such attacks are largely reversible.”74 Nguyen’s approach is one of the best attempts at developing an applicable framework for analyzing cyber-attacks, but suffers from several shortcomings. While her intention and purpose are certainly on-point, the approach advocated by Nguyen is both over- and under-inclusive. This framework covers all attacks that are “intended” to cause physical damage, meaning that an attack need not be successful to warrant self-defense. Under this approach, if a firewall detected and prevented a cyber-attack or virus that was nevertheless intended to cause damage, the target state would be allowed to respond in kind. Every day, countless such attacks are detected and prevented by governments and private companies, and this approach would allow for self-defense retaliation for each of those attacks.75 This would have the effect of This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] immediately putting us at war with several countries.\nAdditionally, this approach is under-inclusive in that it requires a physical aspect for an attack to qualify as an armed attack. In the modern age, a crippling cyber attack that knocks out an entire country's access to the Internet and related networks could be more damaging than a physical attack. As such, any adequate framework should acknowledge that countries should have the ability to respond in the event that they are faced with such an event. Nguyen's framework does not acknowledge this, and as such is inadequate.\nSome scholars have also contended that the majority of cyber-attacks should not be considered\"armed attacks\"under Article 51 at all, and can be dealt with in alternative ways. One such way would be to rely on the United Nations Security Council to respond to cyber attacks. This approach is generally considered to be logistically ineffective. The five permanent members of the Security Council⁷⁶ have an absolute veto, meaning they must each consent to any actions taken by the Council.⁷⁷ This is particularly problematic in hoping for any sort of response to cyber-attacks. Three of the biggest cyber-aggressor countries are Russia, the United States, and China.⁷⁸ Each of these countries would almost always have an incentive to veto ⁷⁶ The United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France.\n⁷⁷ Shin, supra note 19, at 52.\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 586.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] strong anti-cyber-attack actions by the Security Council, making it unlikely that the Council would fill in the role of deterring cyber-attacks.\nAn increasingly popular focus has been to propose that states rely on countermeasures to respond to cyber-attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack.79 In the international law context, countermeasures are “measures which would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”80 Schmitt reasons that many cyber-activities not amounting to an armed attack still amount to an “internationally wrongful act” justifying countermeasures.81 Placing malware on a system, hacking into a network, and destroying data all violate a state’s sovereignty, and abuse the principle of non-intervention. To Schmitt, countermeasures are an adequate way to respond to these attacks.\nWhile an attractive alternative to Articles 2(4) and 51, countermeasures have several preconditions that make them quite limited and difficult to apply to cyber attacks. The purpose of This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] countermeasures is to return a situation to lawfulness.⁸² As such, countermeasures must generally be reversible, and must be stopped as soon as the internationally wrongful conduct has ceased.⁸³ Additionally, an injured state must generally request that the responsible state cease its wrongful conduct, and subsequently afford the responsible State time to conform its conduct.⁸⁴ From a practical point of view, these limitations significantly impair the utility of countermeasures in the cyber-context. Cyber-attacks are often quick invasions that can have an immediate impact. As soon as the attack has occurred, the hacker can pull out quickly. However, once a system has been penetrated, future penetrations are likely to occur. However, countermeasures do not permit the targeted State to permanently alter or impair the aggressor state; they can merely compel the aggressor state to return to a state of lawfulness. By requiring that target States give aggressor states the opportunity to conform their conduct, aggressor states can temporarily halt their attacks before easily resuming them at a later time.\nTwo other restrictions also severely decrease the utility of countermeasures. First, countermeasures can only be undertaken by the ⁸² International Law Commission, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, art. 49(1), G.A. Res. 56/83 annex, U.N. Doc. A/RES/56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001) ⁸³ Schmitt, “Below the Threshold”, supra note 81, at 13.\n⁸⁴ Id. at 14.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] target state. Unlike Article 51 self-defense, countermeasures do not provide for collective action. In the cyber-context, this can be deeply problematic, particularly for smaller countries. The most likely effective countermeasures would be cyber responses not amounting to a use of force. This could include hacking into the aggressor state's systems. However, most countries do not have strong cyber-response capabilities, and may not have sufficient economic or political clout to impose other sorts of countermeasures. This fact would be emphasized by a cyber-attack that could cripple a State's network capabilities. For instance, should a small country be the target of a cyber-attack amounting to a use of force but falling short of an armed attack, they might not have the ability to sufficiently respond, and would depend on their allies to assist them. Under the system of countermeasures, however, allied states would be unable to respond to the aggressor state on behalf of the target state.\nSecond, even if a target country did have sufficient response capabilities, cyber countermeasures could be difficult to properly employ. A country cannot use force in executing a countermeasure, even if the international wrong it is responding to is one of force. In the cyber context, a State employing countermeasures would This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] For example, in the Estonia case, Estonia might have responded to Russia’s DDoS attacks with a similar DDoS attack. However, as Russia’s network is significantly larger than Estonia’s and serves a much larger population,88 the responsive attack could have had a much larger effect. This could have amounted to a use of force, thus making Estonia the State in violation of international law, or an armed attack, allowing Russia to respond with armed force.89 As some states are more susceptible to cyber-attacks than other states, a seemingly benign countermeasure could unpredictably amount to a use of force, something that states are likely to avoid. As such, states will be hesitant to use countermeasures, a fact that further reduces their practical utility.\n## C. A Growing Disconnect Between Scholarship and State Practice As has been demonstrated, there is something intuitively lacking about the current state This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] of each of the leading frameworks, and none of the “alternate” solutions is sufficient to cover the problems that cyber-attacks present to *jus ad bellum*. Each one of these frameworks is either too over-inclusive, under-inclusive, or a mix of the two. While each of these frameworks has its specific problems, there is a more general problem that extends across the proposals. Inherent in each of the analyses is a fundamental disconnect between how countries would respond to cyber-attacks in the modern age and what the frameworks would allow. In other words, there is a general collective opinion of what constitutes tolerable cyber-conduct and what exceeds that threshold of tolerance and will trigger forceful responses. An acceptable framework of analysis would need to encapsulate and reflect that general consensus; however, none of the leading frameworks do so.\nFor instance, it seems intuitive that were the United States the victim of an all-out cyber attack shutting down all government and financial cyber operations, we would treat that as a hostile attack.⁹⁰ Whether or not we chose to retaliate with armed force, it seems likely that if we knew where the attacks were coming from, we would at the very least respond with offensive cyber capabilities. This seems to be the approach that the United States ⁹⁰ See, e.g., Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 103 (“[I]t would very likely be considered an armed attack... if a state caused one major incident such as the complete and long-term crash of the New York Stock Exchange.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] has taken.⁹¹ Such an attack, therefore, would cross the United States’ threshold of tolerance. “Hacking back” to take out the aggressors would likely be considered a use of force, and therefore would only be acceptable under an Article 51 self-defense rationale. However, the only currently proposed rationale that would arguably allow for forceful response in this case is the target-based, or strict-liability, approach. As previously discussed, this approach reaches much too broadly in its scope and cannot be considered to be a tenable approach. In this hypothetical, none of the frameworks would line up with the U.S.’s actual response. Even the Tallinn Manual, which blends the target- and effects-based approaches, acknowledged disagreement within its group of experts, noting that “[t]he case of actions that do not result in injury, death, damage, or destruction, but which otherwise have extensive negative effects, is unsettled.”⁹² Looking to the effects-based and the instrument-based frameworks, there is a common problem that the two approaches share. Both frameworks represent a commitment to the effects of any cyber conduct on the physical world.⁹³ The instrument-based approach would characterize conduct as an “armed attack” only if it employed conventional weapons, capable of causing physical ⁹¹ International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House (2011), at 14 (“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country”).\n⁹² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 64 at 55.\n⁹³ Huntley, supra note 1, at 39.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] damage. This commitment to the pre-digital age provides a familiar analysis that is easy to apply, but fails to take into consideration the changing state of the world. The effects-based approach suffers a similar shortcoming. Although this approach does a better job by acknowledging that what formerly could be achieved only with physical force can now be achieved using cyber-attacks, it still falls short. It is generally accepted that for an attack to pass the effects-based test, there must be physical damage comparable to that caused by a conventional attack that would be considered to be an armed attack. This fails to acknowledge that in the digital age, countries can achieve hugely strategic gains purely through cyber conduct that has no physical consequences at all.\nBy failing to take into account the strategic importance and prevalence of cyber resources and infrastructure, these approaches set the threshold for what constitutes an armed attack too high. This creates a disconnect between what events trigger lawful self-defensive measures under international law (attacks causing physical damage), and what states will actually respond to (attacks that severely undermine strategic cyber resources). As they do not adequately acknowledge the growing significance of damage from cyber-attacks, these frameworks have foreseeable negative consequences. First, they undermine the international legal framework; second, they have the potential for severe escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] This first point should be relatively self-explanatory. In a legal framework (the U.N. Charter) largely dependent on its members' cooperation with the system, establishing a rule that states will refuse to comply with is deeply problematic. If international law forbids states from engaging in offensive cyber-activity, but denies states the ability to actively defend themselves and respond to such attacks, states will likely ignore the framework and continue acting in their best national interests (e.g., continuing to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and deploying these capabilities in response to severe attacks).94 The states most likely to be at the forefront of these developments also happen to be some of the most prominent actors within the U.N. – the United States, China, and Russia.95 As the U.N. has no means to compel compliance with its laws, unchecked non-compliance by some of the largest actors would hugely undermine the credibility and strength of the U.N., and international law in general.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] Second, failing to recognize that pure-cyber attacks can rise to the level of an armed attack can lead to severe escalation, and a dangerous “cyber” arms race. By refusing to recognize that cyber attacks can be harmful to national interests at the level of an armed attack, there is essentially no deterrence of cyber attacks.96 Where countries do not fear the possibility of their attacks being considered armed attacks justifying collective self-defense, they will feel free to continue pushing the boundaries of the armed attack threshold, increasingly widening the gap between what may be an illegal use-of-force or intervention, and what would justify self-defense.\nA perfect example of this is pro-Russian cyber attacks in Estonia and in Ukraine. In both instances, Russia felt confident in engaging in crippling national cyber-attacks, knowing that neither country had a legal right to respond with force.97 With no justification for armed retaliation, Estonia and Ukraine were largely left with no options to respond. In the Ukrainian case, pro-Ukrainian hackers did in fact respond in kind, in what was the first instance of an inter-state “cyber war.”98 Although the attacks ceased before they became too severe, one could easily imagine a This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] situation in which the attacks increase in severity until they became so intolerable to both parties that the only option is conventional war.\nStates have already acknowledged that they consider cyber infrastructure to be just as important as physical infrastructure, and just as crucial to national sovereignty and security. For example, the United States has repeatedly emphasized the significance of cyber-resources and its commitment to protecting those resources as it would any other critical infrastructure. In 2011 the U.S. government published its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” which laid out the administration’s position on cyber-resources. The publication acknowledged that “for all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.”99 After laying out the significance that cyber-resources have to the country’s national interests, the publication took a stance articulating the government’s commitment to a policy of individual and collective self-defense arising from cyber-attacks: When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners.

All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] the right to use all necessary means... in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.¹⁰⁰ As a leading country in the international scene, and the largest target of cyber-attacks, the United States has set the example for what conduct countries will tolerate, and when they will resort to self-defense. A comprehensive framework of *jus ad bellum* should acknowledge this growing international norm. This Paper proposes a framework of analysis that captures both fundamental principles of *jus ad bellum*, and developing modern norms.\n## II. A New Approach – Taking Cyber Resources Into Account Having identified the need for a framework that acknowledges the growing significance and strategic importance of cyber-resources, this Paper now proposes a new framework through which to comprehensively analyze Article 2(4) and 51’s application to cyber-attacks. The proposed framework seeks to reflect changing international perceptions of what constitutes an impermissible cyber-attack, so as to close the gap between Article 2(4) and 51 in the cyber context. The analysis attempts to provide sufficient deterrence to cyber-attacks, while keeping in mind the fear of cyber-escalation.\n¹⁰⁰ *Id.* at 13.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] # A. Defining “Use of Force” in the Cyber Context First, this framework borrows from a commonly accepted definition of the use of force in cyberspace. For the purposes of this analysis, uses of force in the cyber context are “all state activities in cyberspace that intentionally cause any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state...”¹⁰¹ In the interest of covering states’ opinions on the application of Article 2(4), “destructive effect” should be defined to include the substantial undermining of a cyber-resource’s utility.\nMomentarily putting aside the attribution problem,¹⁰² this definition is a well-reasoned adoption of Article 2(4) that acknowledges the importance of cyber-resources in the digital age. First, this definition reflects that Article 2(4) is only concerned with state conduct. Although the line between state actor and private “hacktivist” may become increasingly blurry, it is important to remain rooted to the principle of state liability which the U.N. was founded on. With this being said, states may still be responsible for private attacks originating from their territory.¹⁰³ Second, this is an appropriate definition of use-of-force in that it does not depend on a physical ¹⁰¹ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 132.\n¹⁰² Discussed below in section III (c).\n¹⁰³ See section III (c) below on attribution.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] nexus. By covering “any destructive effect,” this definition includes cyber-attacks that result in losses of data and the destruction of other cyber-resources, as well as the more traditional use-of-force cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet). States are increasingly concerned with the integrity of their data and cyber-resources, and any use-of-force definition should acknowledge states’ desire to restrict unauthorized manipulation and destruction of their cyber-resources. By expanding the scope of Article 2(4) to cover the undermining of the utility of a cyber-resource, this definition brings Article 2(4) up to speed on an extremely harmful cyber tactic.\nThird, by confining the scope of the definition to “within the sovereign territory,” this definition properly acknowledges the underlying principle of Article 2(4) of the protection of state sovereignty and balance of power. To avoid being criticized as over- or under-broad, it is necessary that a comprehensive definition extend solely to the attacks that countries have a right to condemn under international law. The scope of this definition covers attacks from one country into another country that has some sort of destructive effect. By limiting the definition in this way, it reflects the principles that the U.N. Charter was intended to promote: state sovereignty, self-rule, and non-intervention.^[104] This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] # B. Defining “Armed Attack” in the Cyber Context Having defined “use of force” in a way that does not depart from the currently accepted definitions, this Paper proposes a definition for armed attack that can apply to cyber-attacks. This definition seeks to acknowledge the uses of force that countries would choose to respond to in self-defense, and attempts to close the gap between the Article 2(4) prohibition and Article 51 capabilities.\nThis Paper defines an armed attack as a state’s kinetic or virtual use of force made with the intent of altering a target country’s sovereign or strategic power by significantly disrupting its military, critical, or strategic infrastructure.¹⁰⁵ Looking to the definition, there are two dimensions at play: the intent of the attack (“use of force made with the intent...”), and the scope of the attack (“...by significantly disrupting...”). The application of these factors reflects realistic state reactions to international events and other states’ conduct.\nIntent is often looked to in armed attack frameworks. Intent is a useful factor in that hosted in another country. This Paper does not explore this issue in depth, but acknowledges the potential for future research.\n¹⁰⁵ Although an attack meeting this definition would trigger Article 51 responses, where the armed attack is a pure-cyber-attack (that is, an attack with no physical effects), there would be a substantial burden on the target state to respond with cyber-responses. While states could potentially use kinetic force as a last resort, the overwhelming burden is on a state to use cyber means to respond. Because this paper addresses undecided cases regarding “armed attacks,” it does not address pure loss of human life (with no disruption of infrastructure) as there is no significant debate that this would be an armed attack under the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] countries will want to be able to respond to attacks where another state seeks to gain some sort of strategic advantage over them by intentionally undermining their infrastructure or interfering with their sovereignty. Where an attack is unintentional, there is nothing to deter and the sole considerations are liability rather than preventing further exploitation. This sort of policy can best be carried out through the existing international framework, and does not require immediate defensive conduct. Where a state intentionally carries out an armed attack, however, it is in a country's absolute interest to prevent against further attacks on its cyber-resources. This rationale justifies using self-defense against an intentional attack.\nHaving intent, however, is not enough. An attack needs to cross a certain threshold in its scope that justifies self-defense. This Paper's definition acknowledges that countries should be able to resort to self-defense only where their\"sovereign or strategic power\"is being dangerously manipulated, and covers only those attacks that have the ability to significantly disrupt military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. Where an attack does not rise to this level, a state does not have the urgent need to respond that is at the heart of Article 51.\nThis threshold can be crossed by a single severe attack. For instance, an attack that breaks into a country's military network and destroys missile launch codes or flight control software This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] In the event that a single attack does not rise to the level of armed attack, a series of attacks taken in totality may cross the threshold. International law has repeatedly recognized that multiple attacks falling short of Article 51 can collectively be considered an armed attack.¹⁰⁶ This is particularly relevant in the context of cyber-attacks, where there is often a marginal cost in executing additional attacks, and where such attacks can be easily replicated.¹⁰⁷ Nearly all commentators agree on the difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber-attack. It is worth noting again, however, that the intent and scope elements are not independent of each other. As is discussed in further detail below, the scope and nature of a cyber-attack can be used to infer the intent of the aggressor. For instance, a narrow attack like Stuxnet that is launched against a ¹⁰⁶ See e.g., *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicragua*, (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27) (considering whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’”); *Oil Platforms*, (Iran v. U.S.), Judgment, 2003 I.C.J. 161 (Nov. 6) (considering whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the series of... attacks’... can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’”).\n¹⁰⁷ John Markoff, *Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks*, N.Y. TIMES, Aug. 12, 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html (“You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to” (quoting Bill Woodcock)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] specific military or strategic resource can be inferred to have the intent of undermining the target country's sovereign power. Where the attack is narrowly tailored to take out that resource, intent can be easily inferred. Similarly, a continuous pattern of attacks can also carry inferred intent. As such, even where one of the elements of the definition (intent) is lacking, it can be made up for by the other element (scope), providing a sliding-scale model of analysis.\n## C. The Advantages of this Framework Looking to this Paper's definition, it should be apparent that it combines the policy advantages of the target-based and effects-based approaches, while attempting to minimize their shortcomings. To review, the advantage of the target-based approach is that it acknowledges a state's unique interest in actively defending its most important resources and infrastructure. The criticism of that approach is that it covers all attacks on those resources, even where the attack had limited chances of causing substantial damage. In this way, the target-based approach was over-broad. On the other hand, the effects-based approach is conversely problematic. While that approach only covers those attacks demonstrating severe effects, it covers attacks on any target, including purely commercial targets unlikely to result in any strategic or sovereign implications. In this way, the effects-based approach was overbroad. The effects-based This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] approach, however, generally requires some sort of physical damage to occur. This requirement fails to take into consideration the growing significance of pure-cyber resources. In that way, the approach is too narrow in its scope.\nIn light of these advantages and criticisms, this Paper attempts to create a definition that takes into account many of the policy considerations. While, as in the target-based approach, the definition is focused on those resources that a country has an inherent sovereign right to defend (military, critical, or strategic infrastructure), it also acknowledges that Article 51 should be triggered only where the effects and consequences of an attack are severe (significant disruption that can alter a country's sovereign or strategic power). These are consistent with modern international views.\nThe strength of this framework ultimately lies in the fact that it interprets the U.N. Charter in a way that is consistent with modern international opinion. Actively interpreting the Charter in a way that reflects modern international views is not only acceptable, but integral to the survival of the U.N. system.¹⁰⁸ In interpreting the Charter it is preferable to view it not from a strict originalist perspective, but as an attempt at “a heuristic analysis of how the Charter use of force paradigm ¹⁰⁸ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 599-600 (“Far from being counter-legal, this process of reinterpretation is natural; understandings of international legal norms inevitably evolve in response to new threats to the global order.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] has been interpreted through state practice.”¹⁰⁹ International law, and the U.N. Charter in general, is unique from other sources of law in that there is no ultimate enforcer. The U.N. Charter will hold up only as long as its members continue to believe in its purpose and importance. As such, “an evolutive interpretation, which would ensure an application of the treaty that would be effective in terms of its object and purpose, will be preferred to a strict application.”¹¹⁰ Interpreting international law in such a way that would substantially hamstring certain countries’ inherent sovereign rights could only reasonably result in a lack of majoritarian support. Without international endorsement, the whole system is liable to collapse. In furtherance of this goal, “relevant claims [of an expansive definition of ‘armed attack’] ought to be tested against present day customary practice, rather than against pre-Charter custom...”¹¹¹ This Paper’s framework attempts to abide by this paradigm, and presents countries with a framework that reflects their expectations of what is tolerable conduct, encouraging them to conform their cyber-conduct to abide by the Charter.\n## III. Anticipated Criticism Any novel proposal of change to a conventional interpretation of international law can ¹⁰⁹ Sharp, supra note 23, at 73.\n¹¹⁰ Ruys, supra note 86, at 21 (quoting Arbitration regarding the Iron Rhine Railway (Belgium v. The Netherlands), Award of 24 May 2005, 27 RIAA 35-125, §§ 79-81).\n¹¹¹ Id. at 68.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] anticipate criticism. Several criticisms of this Paper's proposed framework are anticipated and responded to in this Part. Although critics may argue that this framework is not consistent with the U.N. Charter, that it will lead to escalation, or that attacks cannot be attributed to their sources, these criticisms are ultimately without merit and not fatal to this Paper's framework.\n## A. Is This What the Drafters Had in Mind? Re-evaluating the U.N. Charter Through a Digital Lens The most significant anticipated criticism is that the U.N. Charter was only intended to prevent physical uses of force and harm. Characterizing Articles 2(4) and 51 as mere limits on the use of kinetic armed force used between states tells only part of the story. Although the text of the Charter and context of its creation do not provide a clear definition of\"use of force\"and\"armed attack,\"scholars can derive the intended scope of these Articles by looking at customary international law and subsequent state practice. Through a careful evaluation of the development and scope of the Charter, this Paper argues that the Articles are primarily concerned with protecting states from imminent, potentially irreversible threats to their territorial integrity and political independence, and are not limited to physical attacks. Therefore, this Paper is consistent with the original principles of the U.N. Charter.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] The commonly accepted definition for what constitutes an armed attack is that the consequences must meet some sort of de minimis threshold.¹¹² These consequences are often characterized by “territorial intrusions, human casualties or considerable destruction of property.”¹¹³ This does not mean that substantial casualties or destruction need occur, merely that such attacks “are capable of resulting in destruction of property or loss of lives.”¹¹⁴ Essentially, this de minimis test plots any use of force on a scale based on the severity of the consequences, with armed attacks rising above a certain point on the scale.¹¹⁵ Thinking about this threshold in a simple one-dimensional framework with a metric such as amount of damage or number of deaths does not capture the full picture. International law leaves open the possibility that small-scale uses of force may also rise to the level of an armed attack. For example, in the Oil Platforms case the ICJ specifically refused to “exclude the possibility that the mining of a single military vessel might be sufficient to bring into play the ‘inherent right of self-defense.’”¹¹⁶ Therefore, the analysis is more complex. Looking at customary practice, “it is not sufficient to merely examine the scale and effects of ¹¹² Mary Ellen O’Connell, Lawful Self-Defense to Terrorism, 63 U. PITT. L.

[2014] the attack. Two other factors must be addressed, namely the so-called ‘animus aggressionis’ and the repetitive or isolated nature of the attack(s).¹¹⁷ i. States’ Consideration of “Aggressive Intent” The aggressive intent of a state’s conduct has repeatedly been deemed a significant factor underlying the Article 51 analysis. Looking at historical examples that have been deemed “armed attacks” triggering Article 51 self defense, it is apparent that the aggressive intent of an action is capable of pushing a use of force, which would otherwise not cross the *de minimis* threshold, into the realm of Article 51, and vice versa (conduct that would otherwise cross the *de minimis* threshold is not an armed attack where there is no aggressive intent).¹¹⁸ For example, in the case of the British raid on Harib Fort in 1964, a very low level of force was used against the British.¹¹⁹ Although Yemeni aircraft had fired on Aden,¹²⁰ the resulting damage had been limited to the death of a few camels. The British struck back, relying on self-defense under Article 51. The British emphasized that, although small in scale, the attacks were “deliberate air ¹¹⁷ *Id.* at 157.\n¹¹⁸ *Id.* at 164 (listing examples of low-intensity events justifying self-defense based on the “‘premeditated’, ‘offensive’ or ‘deliberate’ character of alleged attacks”).\n¹¹⁹ U.N.

Security Council condemned the British Air Force’s subsequent bombing of Fort Harib, which allegedly resulted in civilian casualties, the majority of states agreed that self-defense was in fact justified based on the deliberate nature of the attacks, but that Britain’s response had been excessive.¹²² This pattern of legitimately justifying self-defense based on aggressive intent is seen in a number of other examples, including the 1967 Six Day War,¹²³ the 1968 Israeli campaign against Lebanon,¹²⁴ and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict.¹²⁵ Conversely, where substantial physical damage occurs, an act may not trigger self-defense without aggressive intent. For example, during NATO’s Operation “Allied Force” in Belgrade, NATO troops destroyed the Chinese embassy, killing four Chinese nationals and injuring twenty others.¹²⁶ Certainly, under any definition of armed attack based on physical damage this destruction would be considered an “armed attack.” However, NATO immediately issued an apology, explaining that the attack was due to faulty targeting information. Although the Chinese public responded to the attack with mass protests, at no ¹²¹ U.N. Doc. S/PV.1107, 3 April 1964, § 3.\n¹²² See, e.g., U.N. Doc.

[2014] point was there any suggestion that China could consider the event an “armed attack” justifying self-defense.¹²⁷ This may seem intuitive, but it is worth pointing out that the underlying reason was that there was no aggressive intent.\nTaken together, these examples demonstrate that: first, absent *de minimis* intensity, events can still be justifiably considered armed attacks based on their aggressive intent; and, second, that events crossing the *de minimis* threshold may not trigger Article 51, absent aggressive intent.¹²⁸ This analysis enforces this Paper’s contention that the conventional “use of force” and “armed attack” focus on physical violence was selected merely as a proxy for which to identify other policies that the drafters of the Charter wished to further and protect – in this case, preventing aggressive actions between countries.\nAdditionally, this provides a satisfactory explanation of why minor border skirmishes are generally not considered to be armed attacks.¹²⁹ Rather than explaining these events as simply not crossing the *de minimis* threshold, it makes more sense to explain that border skirmishes carry a rebuttable presumption of a lack of aggressive ¹²⁷ Ruys, *supra* note 86, at 165.\n¹²⁸ “In the end, the Definition of Aggression, the case law of the ICJ and customary practice provide credible indications that hostile intent is a relevant factor for determining whether an ‘armed attack’ has occurred.” *Id.* at 166.\n¹²⁹ See Hathaway et al, *supra* note 22 (“The ICJ has indicated that cross-border incursions that are minor in their ‘scale and effects’ may be classified as mere ‘frontier incident[s]’ rather than ‘armed attacks.’” (quoting Nicaragua)).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] intent.¹³⁰ It is generally to be expected that the situation on a border may create friction, and that periodic forceful engagements may occur. Absent any aggressive state-intent, these encounters do not demonstrate the type of conduct that the drafters meant to prohibit. However, where a state has evidence of demonstrated aggressive intent (coordinated attacks, strategic movement, etc.), then these border skirmishes may be considered armed attacks, justifying self-defense.¹³¹ ## ii. The Impact of Accumulated Attacks on the Article 51 Analysis An additional factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether Article 51 has been triggered is the accumulation of multiple uses of force.¹³² This “needle prick” theory is important in considering states’ interests and their need to respond to certain events. The concept is that where no single event crosses the threshold into an “armed attack”, a series of attacks may be looked at in their totality as sufficient to justify self-defense.¹³³ Indeed, state practice and international tribunal decisions lend credence to the conclusion ¹³⁰ Sharp, supra note 23, at 47.\n¹³¹ See, e.g., 2006 Israeli-Lebanon conflict, supra note 66.\n¹³² Some argue that the Security Council has expressly rejected this policy. While, indeed, the Security Council has rejected several self-defense claims based on the accumulation theory, further insight into Council debates reveals that the rejection was generally focused on other aspects of the states’ conduct, such as disproportionate response. See, Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹³³ Matthias Schmidl, THE CHANGING NATURE OF SELF-DEFENCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 53 (2009).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] that the accumulation of individual uses of force is pertinent to the determination of whether Article 51 has been triggered. In recent years, some version of the rationale has been invoked by Israel (on a regular basis), Russia (in response to Georgian bandits), Lebanon (in response to Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace), Iran (responding to attacks from Iraq), Iraq (responding to UK and US aerial attacks), Liberia (against Guinea), and Sudan (against Chad). Particularly revealing has been the ICJ's acknowledgement of the significance of the repetition or accumulation of events.\nFor example, in Nicaragua, the Court reasoned that it was difficult to decide whether attacks “singly or collectively amount[ed] to an ‘armed attack.’” The Court followed this line of reasoning in the Oil Platforms case, where the ICJ framed the question as whether “that attack, either in itself or in combination with the rest of the ‘series of... attacks’... can be categorized as an ‘armed attack.’” This repeated emphasis by the ICJ recognizes that the question of whether self-defense is justified hinges on more than whether a single attack has crossed a de minimis threshold of This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] severity. The accumulation of several smaller events, though not crossing the de minimis threshold, can still be sufficient in their totality to threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or political independence of a state, thus justifying Article 51 self-defense.¹⁴³ This concept of accumulation is increasingly relevant in the modern world, where asymmetrically situated actors may not resort to full-scale attacks. For instance, guerrilla or rebel groups may rely on systematic hit-and-run tactics, with each event not amounting to a full-scale armed attack. However, the repeated and continuous nature of these events may very well threaten a state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a state should be allowed to defend itself from these attacks.¹⁴⁴ This concept recognizes that an accumulation of smaller attacks may substantially alter a country’s strategic or sovereign power, and should be able to respond even absent substantial physical damage. As with aggressive intent, this focus further undermines the argument that Articles 2(4) and 51 are concerned solely with preventing substantial physical violence. This analysis further supports this Paper’s position, which allows for self-defense where a series of attacks threaten to alter a country’s sovereign or strategic power.¹⁴⁵ ¹⁴³ Gervais, supra note 33, at 556-57.\n¹⁴⁴ Ruys, supra note 86, at 169.\n¹⁴⁵ Given the nature of cyber-attacks, it is quite foreseeable that countries will engage in a series of attacks to accomplish their goals.

[2014] ## iii. Putting It All Together: More Than Just Physical Violence Having analyzed the text and *travaux préparatoires* of Articles 2(4) and 51, and having discussed the significance of customary practice, this Paper concludes that the drafters of the Charter were not solely concerned with preventing the use of certain state tactics (kinetic force). The very purpose of the Charter is not to prevent the use of weapons, but “is concerned with human rights, social progress, justice, standards of life, tolerance, and living together in peace as good neighbors.”¹⁴⁶ The drafters ultimately were concerned with protecting state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence.¹⁴⁷ Article 2(4)’s prime purpose is to protect the sovereign equality of member states, and Article 51 is designed to preserve the status quo of territorial integrity and independence.¹⁴⁸ While it is easy to look at Article 2(4) and 51 and conclude that they are merely concerned with instrumentality (weapons of kinetic force); upon peeling back the purposes it becomes should be a burden of proof that the state must meet demonstrating the impending nature of further attacks.\n¹⁴⁶ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\n¹⁴⁷ In the context of post-WWII international affairs, this is painfully clear. Despite having just witnessed six million individuals killed by the Nazis, at the Nuremberg Trials the international community focused solely on the crimes of aggression – that is, crimes against the sovereignty and independence of states. David A. Soley, “*Hunt v. Galteri A Hypothetical Scenario for Holding International Aggressors Civilly Liable in American Courts,*” 33 EMORY L.J. 211, 221 (1984).\n¹⁴⁸ See Schmidt, *supra* note 133, at 56 (“[The] U.N. is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.... The most important object... is to... restore the status quo ante.”).\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] apparent that the rationale is to protect against the consequences arising from a use of kinetic force. In a more comprehensive analysis of self-defense, the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reasoned that “self-defense is action taken by a State to defend its territorial integrity or its independence... with the object of preventing another’s wrongful action from proceeding and achieving its purpose.”¹⁴⁹ Hence, kinetic force is not the ends that are being prohibited, but the means that would accomplish them; the true concern is sovereignty and the protection of states’ internal and external affairs.¹⁵⁰ So why use the terms “force” and “armed attack”? Why did the drafters not say that self-defense could be used where sovereignty or political independence was threatened? As Schmitt describes, prior to the advent of cyber operations, there was a close congruence between the “normative shorthand” and the consequences the international community sought to limit.¹⁵¹ In other words, at the time of drafting, severe infringements on state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence could only be achieved through military kinetic force. However, with the introduction of cyber weapons, “the qualitative shorthand no longer tracked the quantitative ¹⁴⁹ Commentary on Article 34, Self-Defence, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States, YBILC (1980), Vol. II, Part Two, at 53 para 5.\n¹⁵⁰ Mohammad Naqib Ishan Jan, USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 44 (2011).\n¹⁵¹ Schmitt, supra note 51, at 603.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] concerns of the states.\"¹⁵² With the growing disconnect between the\"shorthand\"and the policies to be furthered, it is becoming increasingly important to take into account the interest and goals that the drafters intended to achieve.¹⁵³ Any definitions and applications of the 2(4) and 51 language should seek to fulfill the spirit of these policies as closely as possible.\nIn adopting an appropriate modern definition of\"use of force\"and\"armed attack\"that is in accord with the original policies and principles of the U.N. Charter, it is important to take into account the same factors that were important to the drafters. Although\"kinetic force\"itself is an unsatisfactory metric, there are other proxy-factors that apply equally well to non-kinetic actions, which this Paper's proposed definitions take into account. Although the generally accepted test is the\"de minimis\"test, an inclusive definition should take into account the aggressive intent of a state actor, the cumulative nature of actions, and any territorial intrusions that accompany the conduct. Simply limiting the scope of Articles 2(4) and 51 to physical attacks\"is not persuasive because it focuses on only one goal and ignores the broader context of the Charter.\"¹⁵⁴ Therefore, criticism of this Paper arguing that it exceeds the intended scope ¹⁵² *Id.* at 604.\n¹⁵³ *Id.* at 587-88 (\"intent was to preclude certain consequences... drafters would surely have allowed for defense in the face of severe [cyber attacks]\").\n¹⁵⁴ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 89.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] of Articles 2(4) and 51 by rejecting a physical nexus is to be expected, but is ultimately without merit.\n## B. Fear of Escalation A second anticipated criticism, which is often heard regarding the scope of Article 51, is the fear of escalation.¹⁵⁵ The argument is that by broadening the scope of what a state may respond to with force, states will employ force in situations that the target state may deem to be an illegal use of force, leading to a cycle of increasingly severe uses of force. In practice, however, this framework only acknowledges as legal responses that states would already undertake, bringing international law into harmony with state practice.\nThis “slippery slope” argument is important to take into account, but the framework proposed in this Paper does not contribute to an escalation of violence. First, it is important to note that even where Article 51 is triggered, there remains a strict application of the principles of necessity and proportionality.¹⁵⁶ Target states seeking to exercise their Article 51 rights would need to first exhaust all viable legal options, and show that their use of force would be a last resort. Once a state decides to respond with force, they must use the minimum amount of force necessary to defend themselves.¹⁵⁷ Although this Paper proposes broadening the scope ¹⁵⁵ See, e.g., Huntley, supra note 1, at 6; Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 846.\n¹⁵⁶ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁵⁷ Hathaway et. al, supra note 22, at 849.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] For example, suppose the United States is the target of a severe DDoS attack crippling the economy, communications, and nuclear launch codes. We are able to confirm that the attacks are being controlled by operators sitting in a specific building in Country B. Under the old frameworks, the United States would be unable to respond with any use of force, including “hacking back.” Under this Paper’s framework, the U.S. would be legally allowed to respond in self-defense under Article 51.¹⁵⁸ As the attack on the U.S. would be purely cyber, however, the U.S. would face a heavy burden to respond with cyber-attacks only, such as hacking into the attackers’ systems and shutting them down. Only in the event that these attacks were not viable could the U.S. respond with kinetic force (e.g., a drone strike on the attackers’ building).\nThe second reason this framework would not lead to escalation is that it opens the scope of Article 51 only to what states would already do.\n¹⁵⁸ By crippling the economy, communications, and launch codes, the attacks certainly disrupt strategic and sovereign infrastructure in a way that alters sovereign power.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] States can respond only to attacks that significantly threaten their sovereign or strategic power. Indeed, any analysis denying states this ability is “not only counter-intuitive, but also incompatible with actual State practice.”¹⁵⁹ A state confronted with such a severe cyber-attack will respond with some use of force (even if only a responsive cyber-attack) regardless of international law.¹⁶⁰ It is difficult to imagine that in the above hypothetical that the United States would not respond with force of some kind. As such, this framework is not encouraging states to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not have considered; rather, this framework brings international law up to speed with current state practice and opinion. A legal system denying states the right to self-defense would not remove the threat of escalation, it would simply undermine the legitimacy of the system.¹⁶¹ By acknowledging that states will respond in self-defense to cyber-attacks threatening their sovereign or strategic power, international law can more properly regulate such responses, and potentially de-escalate the situation.\n## C. Attribution Problem Perhaps the most unique problem with cyber-attacks is the difficulty of attribution. Unlike conventional attacks, there are generally no flags being flown, no soldiers to question, and no ¹⁵⁹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532.\n¹⁶⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 543-44.\n¹⁶¹ Ruys, supra note 86, at 532. (“It moreover seems illusory to think that simply denying this right would remove the threat of escalation.”)\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] physical weapons to determine the country of origin.¹⁶² Cyber-attacks come out of the shadows, with their paths often being obscured through rerouted and masked IP addresses.¹⁶³ It is often only after time has passed that it becomes clear where the attack originated from, and even years later there may be no definite answer.¹⁶⁴ This problem has led many to criticize expanding Article 51 self-defense to cover responses to cyber-attacks. The argument is that states may be able to mask their cyber-attacks to make them appear to be originating from another country, and therefore instigate conflict.¹⁶⁵ If states cannot accurately determine where an attack is coming from, they should not risk wrongful armed conflict.\nThis criticism is largely a matter of technological capability, and does not undermine the utility of a system that expands Article 51 to cover pure-cyber-attacks. It often is possible to determine where an attack is coming from.¹⁶⁶ A target country may be able to trace the IP of the attacker, spot similarities with previous attacks, or have a\"honeypot\"in place to detect and identify ¹⁶² It is worth noting that this issue is not entirely unique to cyberspace. Countries are capable of sending\"anonymous\"soldiers into another country to conduct operations. An example of this is the 2014 events in Crimea, where Russia sent unmarked troops in to Ukrainian territory. Alberto Riva, Russia's Use Of Unmarked Troops In Simferopol, Crimea, INT'L BUS.

In February 2013, the computer security firm Mandiant released a study documenting their efforts to track large numbers of cyber-attacks.¹⁶⁸ Through a variety of techniques, Mandiant was able to not only able to identify the origin of the attacks as coming from China, but was able to pinpoint the exact building in which the group operated, was able to reveal information about the individual hackers, and was able to attribute the group as being part of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).¹⁶⁹ Only a year later, following the Sony Pictures hacks, the FBI was quickly able to attribute the attacks to North Korean hackers.¹⁷⁰ The ability to accurately attribute the source of cyber-attacks is likely to improve as technology develops and as countries begin to funnel more resources into their cyber-capabilities.¹⁷¹ Even where an attack can be traced to a specific country of origin, the attack must be ¹⁶⁷ Id.\n¹⁶⁸ See David E.

[2014] attributed to a state actor to trigger self-defense. This is particularly problematic in the cyber-world, where governments often employ the services of semi-independent hacker groups or “hacktivists” to accomplish their cyber-goals.¹⁷² For instance, the 2007 cyber-attacks targeting Estonia were attributed to the Russian Nashi youth activist group, but it was unclear whether the Russian Federation was ultimately responsible.¹⁷³ Where an attack cannot be directly attributed to a state actor, critics may argue that self-defense measures would be inappropriate.\nFortunately, international law in this area is already relatively established and permits self-defense measures even where there is not absolute attribution of an attack to a state actor. Attribution for an attack can be inferred to a state where the states allows the attacks to be carried out on their territory, and where the state does not reasonably try to stop the attacks after being asked to.¹⁷⁴ This principle is supported by *opinio juris* and state practice. In the ICJ’s first case, the *Corfu Channel Case*, the ICJ firmly acknowledged this principle that every state has an “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁷⁵ By failing to stop the internationally wrongful acts, the host state ¹⁷² Gervais, supra note 33, at 546.\n¹⁷³ Michael N.

The International Law Commission’s adoption of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts has further established this concept. The Draft Articles reason that conduct will “be considered an act of that State... if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own”¹⁷⁶ by failing to take actions to suppress the conduct.¹⁷⁷ In the last twenty years, there has been a shift in state practice similarly acknowledging this principle of State responsibility for non-state conduct. The events following 9/11 demonstrate this shift of legal responsibility.¹⁷⁸ Under a traditional analysis, the support provided by the Afghanistan government to al-Qaeda (providing sanctuary) would not have been sufficient to impute responsibility for al-Qaeda’s actions to Afghanistan.¹⁷⁹ When the United States and Coalition forces used armed force against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, however, there was no international outcry. To the contrary, the international community supported the Coalition’s actions, and the U.N. Security Council condemned the Taliban for “allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism... and for ¹⁷⁶ International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the Int’l Law Comm’n, 53d Sess., Apr. 23-June 1, July 2-Aug. 10, 2001, U.N.

[2014] This international norm provides guidance in analysis of cyber-attacks. The analogy to the 9/11 events would be a country that knows that malicious hackers are operating on its territory, and does nothing to stop them. Whether or not the State is actively supporting the hackers, by allowing them to operate with impunity the conduct of the hackers are imputed to the State. In fact, this principle is a rapidly growing international duty. The European Convention on Cybercrime specifically establishes a duty for states to prevent their territories from being used for cyber-attacks,¹⁸² a duty that has been echoed by U.N. declarations.¹⁸³ Imputing liability to a host state would discourage states from unofficially using “hacktivists” to obtain cyber-results. The approach would also substantially incentivize states to police their own “cyber- ¹⁸⁰ Gervais, supra note 33, at 546-47; S.C. Res. 1378, pmbl., U.N. Doc. S/RES/1378 (Nov. 14, 2001).\n¹⁸¹ David E.

Additionally, the frequent lack of an ability to attribute an attack to a state-actor does not undermine the application of this Paper’s framework, as international law and state practice already accept the imputation of liability to a host state for conduct emanating from its territory.\n## IV. Conclusion In this case, it is worth taking a lesson from history. Prior to the twentieth century, under the “Grotian” view of international law, armed conflict was largely the norm.¹⁸⁵ A country merely had to declare war on another country for any variety of reasons (debt, personal offenses to leaders, etc.), and the war was presumptively legitimate. At the very least, no one in the international community was going to dispute the results of the war as being wrongful. This led to an increasing number of wars and loss of life, ultimately resulting in World War I. After that point, international powers took a strong stance on aggression and unjustified use of force, declaring it illegal in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and ¹⁸⁴ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 37 (“Knowing that a threat coming from or through their systems and networks... will invoke a response may spur other states to take a more active role in the defense and policing of their networks.”).\n¹⁸⁵ Sharp, *supra* note 23, at 29.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms A Brave New World... [2014] The current state of international law with respect to cyber attacks is analogous to Grotius’s state of conventional warfare. With the international community failing to take a strong stance on cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks have essentially been legitimized. As long as no kinetic destruction occurs as a result of a cyber-attack, the international community seems to consider these attacks presumptively legitimate. By applying an “old-school” analysis to a “new-school” problem, an incentive is created for parties to engage in cyber-attacks, as they have little fear of significant retribution.¹⁸⁷ As in the pre-Kellogg-Briand era, where the international community does not have a strong consensus or agreement on the legitimacy of cyber-attacks, countries will take full advantage of this new technology. This is a fact that is driven home to the United States every day, as the largest target of cyber-attacks. In the Twentieth Century, the solution to legitimized war was the creation of the U.N. system in which countries could air their differences and adjudicate their disputes. With that system already in place, the solution to “legitimized” cyber-attacks is to bring those attacks wholly within the realm of the U.N. Charter system. This should be done in a way that acknowledges what types of cyber-conduct states are willing to ¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 32-33.\n¹⁸⁷ Huntley, *supra* note 1, at 40.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Journal of Law and Cyber Warfare [2014] tolerate, and what they determine to be unacceptable.\nTo this point, no frameworks have been proposed that accurately reflect the developing international perceptions on what is a tolerable cyber-attack, and what would trigger Article 51 self-defense. By laying out definitions that are not dependent on a physical nexus, this Paper brings into the scope of Article 51 conduct that states would already engage in – responses to attacks significantly disrupting a state’s military, critical, or strategic infrastructure. By focusing on the aggressive intent an accumulation of attacks, this proposal remains consistent with the underlying policies of the U.N. Charter, while applying dated definitions to the digital age. In doing so, this Paper proposes a framework that countries can abide by and support, and that will encourage regulation of the increasingly common use of cyber-attacks.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:30 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

    "abstract": "State and non-state actors are using international cyber-attacks with an increasing frequency and magnitude, causing new levels of damage and disruption. Despite this growing significance, the legal status of cyber-attacks in international law remains unclear. Cyber-attacks do not fit under the conventional analyses of “use of force” and “armed attacks” under the UN Charter, and no satisfactory approaches have been put forth to treat cyber-attacks. This Paper puts forth a test for whether cyber-attacks constitute a “use of force” and “armed attack” that reflects the traditional goals of the UN Charter, while taking into account the present realities of the use of cyber-attacks. Specifically, this Paper considers cyber-attacks to † Yale Law School, J.D. expected 2015; The Pennsylvania State University, B.A. 2012.
