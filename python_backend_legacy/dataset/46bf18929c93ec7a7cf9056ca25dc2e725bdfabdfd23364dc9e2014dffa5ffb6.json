Hususi olarak; özel kişilerin siber-uzaydaki haksız eylemlerinden dolayı devletlerin sorumlu tutulup tutulamayacağı hususu hukuki bir sorunsal olarak ele alınmaktadır. Burada amaç, daha güvenli bir siber dünya için devletlerin uluslararası sorumluluğunu düzenleyen uluslararası normların açıklığa kavuşturulması ve bu normlara bağlı atfedilebilirlik kurallarının uygulamasını tanımlamaktır.\n\nDevlet organı olmayan, devlet dışı aktörlerin günümüz politik ve askeri çatışma ortamında gittikçe artan etkisi yadsınamayacak noktadadır. Bir kısım devletler bunu kendi avantajlarına kullanmak suretiyle, özel kişileri aracı kılarak işledikleri haksız eylemlere rağmen kolayca sorumluluktan kaçınabilmektedirler. Siber-uzaydaki haksız eylemler ve bu konuda sponsor olan devletlerin hukuk karşısında hesap verebilmeleri için katı veya esnek delillere başvurulup başvurulmayacağı, devletlerin uygulamasıyla ancak netlik kazanacaktır.\n\n¹ Doctor of Laws in International Law LLM, Young Leaders’ Program Fellowship Kyushu University-Japan",

Introduction\n\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\n\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized.² Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\n\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\n\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n\n¹ Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\n\nCyber attacks,³ whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not,⁴ have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control.⁵ Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available.⁶ These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.⁷\n\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges.⁸ Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n\n³ See generally, MICHAEL N.

The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records.²⁶ North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.²⁷\n\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns.²⁸ An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare.²⁹ International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks.

How states react: two main perspectives\n\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways.

The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels.³⁴ Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.³⁵\n\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\n\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle³⁶ or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\n\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions.³⁷ Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm.³⁸ Instead,\n\n³² *Id.*\n\n³³ *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n\n³⁴ There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n\n³⁵ *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n\n³⁶ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n\n³⁷ For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n\n³⁸ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act.⁴⁰ Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.⁴¹\n\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation”⁴² in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework.⁴³ In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.⁴⁴\n\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\n\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law.

Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.⁶¹\n\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author.⁶² Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”⁶³\n\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\n\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase.⁶⁴ The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\n\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility.⁶⁵ In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator.⁶⁶ For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n\n## 3.3.

[I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"⁶⁸\n\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.⁶⁹\n\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity.⁷⁰ This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility.⁷¹ Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.⁷²\n\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\").⁷³ Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"⁷⁴\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Existing attribution standards\n\nAttribution⁷⁵ is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation.⁷⁶ In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.”⁷⁷ Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states.⁷⁸ Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”⁷⁹\n\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process.⁸⁰ A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁸¹ for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras.

There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups.

In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying¹⁰⁰ to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.¹⁰¹\n\n## A single test or more\n\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.¹⁰²\n\n⁹⁸ Id., at para. §109.\n\n⁹⁹ Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n\n¹⁰⁰ Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n\n¹⁰¹ Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n\n¹⁰² Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.”¹¹⁴ “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”¹¹⁵\n\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity.¹¹⁶ According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.¹¹⁷\n\n¹⁰⁹ Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n¹¹⁰ Id., at 891.\n¹¹¹ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹² Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n\n## Strict control test\n\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\n\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^\n\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^[121]^\n\n## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case\n\nIn 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\n^[118]^ Id., at 498.\n^[119]^ Id., at 500.\n^[120]^ Id., at 500.\n^[121]^ Id., at 502.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n\n¹²³ For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N.

ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n\n¹²⁴ ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n\n¹²⁵ Id., at para. §379.

First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State.

The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.”¹³¹ The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY.¹³² The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.¹³³\n\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment.¹³⁴ The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\n\nthe Genocide Convention.\n\n¹²⁶ Id., at paras. §385-412.

And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.”¹³⁶ Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.¹³⁷\n\n## Scholarly Critiques\n\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test¹³⁸ in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique.¹³⁹ Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”.¹⁴⁰ Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.¹⁴¹\n\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n\n¹³⁵ *Id.*, at para. §394.\n\n¹³⁶ *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n\n¹³⁷ *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n\n¹³⁸ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n\n¹³⁹ See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n\n¹⁴⁰ Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n\n¹⁴¹ Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.¹⁴⁸\n\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.”¹⁴⁹ The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.¹⁵⁰\n\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n\n¹⁴⁸ ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n¹⁴⁹ Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n¹⁵⁰ Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n143",

The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility.¹⁵¹ This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”¹⁵²\n\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”¹⁵³\n\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.”¹⁵⁴ Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.¹⁵⁵\n\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\n\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n\n¹⁵¹ Id., at para. §98.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id., at para. §114.\n¹⁵⁴ Id., at paras. §116-123.\n¹⁵⁵ Id., at para. §124-145.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"¹⁵⁷\n\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"¹⁵⁸\n\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.¹⁵⁹\n\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"¹⁶⁰\n\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals.

The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice.¹⁶² In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”¹⁶³\n\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State.¹⁶⁴ “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.”¹⁶⁵ Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.¹⁶⁶\n\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law.

Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”¹⁶⁷\n\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment¹⁶⁸ triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply.¹⁶⁹ The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.¹⁷⁰\n\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.¹⁷¹\n\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n\n¹⁶⁷ Id., at paras. §137, §138.

Turkey (1996)\n\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey¹⁷⁹, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’¹⁸⁰\n\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).”¹⁸¹ Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.¹⁸²\n\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities.

Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\n\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\n\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one.²¹⁶ The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state.²¹⁷ Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State.²¹⁸ Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.²¹⁹\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel.²²⁰ The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.²²¹\n\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ.²²² Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications.²²³ According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus.²²⁴ Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.²²⁵\n\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons.²²⁶ In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations.²²⁷ The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.²²⁸\n\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n\n220 Id., paras. §75, §86.\n221 Id., paras §75, §86, §115.\n222 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 265.\n223 International jurisprudence and conflicting tests display such reality.\n224 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, Article 8, commentary para §2.\n225 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 267.\n226 Id., at 268.\n227 ICJ, Nicaragua case, supra note 80, para. §115.\n228 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 268.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State.²²⁹ The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.²³⁰\n\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State.²³¹ This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.²³²\n\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant²³³ who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus.²³⁴ It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”²³⁵\n\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\n\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n\n### Complete dependence\n\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control.²³⁶ According to the\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.²³⁹\n\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\n\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.²⁴⁰\n\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\n\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor.²⁴¹ De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State.²⁴² Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.²⁴³\n\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation.²⁴⁴ Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\n\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified.²⁴⁵ It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”.²⁴⁶ Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas.²⁴⁷ This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State.²⁴⁸ The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.²⁴⁹\n\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question.²⁵² In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State.²⁵³ The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”.²⁵⁴ For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.²⁵⁵\n\n## 4.2.

Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey.²⁵⁷ To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.”²⁵⁸ The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁵⁹ Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”²⁶⁰\n\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State.²⁶¹ The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.²⁶²\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Specifics of control theory\n\n### The Concept of Control\n\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity.²⁶³ The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.”²⁶⁴ There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient.²⁶⁵ The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question.²⁶⁶ Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”²⁶⁷\n\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities.²⁶⁸ A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.²⁶⁹\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group.²⁷⁰ Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.²⁷¹\n\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person.²⁷² Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.²⁷³\n\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\n\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred.²⁷⁴ The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.²⁷⁵\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends.²⁷⁶ Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy.²⁷⁷ These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\n\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey²⁷⁸ case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus.²⁷⁹ The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’.²⁸⁰ The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁸¹\n\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n\n²⁷⁶ Prosecutor v.

This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.²⁸⁷\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\n\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State.²⁸⁹ In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\n\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced.²⁹⁰ This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State.²⁹¹ As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\n\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation.²⁹² Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].”²⁹³ This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\n\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State.²⁹⁴ The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws.²⁹⁵ If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\n\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.²⁹⁶\n\n# BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n## Kaynakça\n\n## Books/ Kitap\n\nIAN BROWNLIE, STATE RESPONSIBILITY (SYSTEM OF THE LAW OF NATIONS) (1983)\n\nJAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013)\n\nJAMES CRAWFORD; ALAIN PELLET, SIMON OLLESON &amp; KATE PARLETT (EDS.), THE LAW OF INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY (2010)\n\nMARKO MILANOVIC, EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES: LAW, PRINCIPLES, AND POLICY (2011)\n\nMAURIZIO RAGAZZI (ED.), INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TODAY: ESSAYS IN MEMORIES OF OSCAR SCHACHTER, (2005)\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017",

Introduction\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nproof.¹ States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized.² Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n¹ Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\nCyber attacks,³ whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not,⁴ have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control.⁵ Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available.⁶ These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.⁷\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges.⁸ Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n³ See generally, MICHAEL N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 2014 Sony attack\nComputer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014,²⁴ allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.²⁵ The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records.²⁶ North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.²⁷\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns.²⁸ An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare.²⁹ International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.³⁰\n## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race.³¹ Although international law includes\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nvarious rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.³²\nIn regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that \"cyber space is international space.\"³³ Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels.³⁴ Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.³⁵\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle³⁶ or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions.³⁷ Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm.³⁸ Instead,\n³² *Id.*\n³³ *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n³⁴ There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n³⁵ *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n³⁶ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n³⁷ For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n³⁸ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nsuch legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively.³⁹ In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act.⁴⁰ Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.⁴¹\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation”⁴² in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework.⁴³ In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.⁴⁴\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”⁴⁵\nSince “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,”⁴⁶ this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in\n³⁹ Supra note 28, at 189.\n⁴⁰ Supra note 23, at 212.\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² Mathew C.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nor through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability⁴⁷ expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.⁴⁸\n## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility\nThe primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it.⁴⁹ In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations.⁵⁰ Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.”⁵¹ The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and . . . apply unless excluded.”⁵²\nSuch “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable.⁵³ Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nactivities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply.⁵⁴ The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.⁵⁵\n## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues\nStates and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons,⁵⁶ in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State.⁵⁷ Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons.⁵⁸ In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.⁵⁹\nCyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct⁶⁰ and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors\n⁵⁴ Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 49, at 20.\n⁵⁶ JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n⁵⁷ U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nin or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.⁶¹\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author.⁶² Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”⁶³\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase.⁶⁴ The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility.⁶⁵ In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator.⁶⁶ For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution\nAs stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and\n⁶¹ Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report (November 2010) *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016)\n⁶² Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n⁶³ *Id.* at 230.\n⁶⁴ *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n⁶⁵ *Id.*\n⁶⁶ *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\"⁶⁷ In other words, \"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"⁶⁸\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.⁶⁹\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity.⁷⁰ This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility.⁷¹ Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.⁷²\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\").⁷³ Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"⁷⁴\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 3.4. Existing attribution standards\nAttribution⁷⁵ is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation.⁷⁶ In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.”⁷⁷ Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states.⁷⁸ Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”⁷⁹\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process.⁸⁰ A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁸¹ for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007.⁸² In another widely cited\n⁷⁵ For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test\nThe Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87\nThe contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90\n## As acting on behalf of (US) government\nThe ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nStates' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.⁹¹\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict⁹², it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States.⁹³ However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact.⁹⁴ Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States.⁹⁵ The Court formulated the test as follow;\n“Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”⁹⁶\nFrom the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government.⁹⁷ It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it;\n⁹¹ Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n⁹² Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n⁹³ Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n⁹⁴ Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n⁹⁵ Id., at paras. §109-121.\n⁹⁶ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁷ Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nrather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’.⁹⁸ The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.⁹⁹\nThe contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying¹⁰⁰ to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.¹⁰¹\n## A single test or more\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.¹⁰²\n⁹⁸ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁹ Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n¹⁰⁰ Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n¹⁰¹ Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n¹⁰² Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nwhether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State.¹⁰⁹ ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it.¹¹⁰ In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”¹¹¹\nTalmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case.¹¹² He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ.¹¹³ The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.”¹¹⁴ “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”¹¹⁵\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity.¹¹⁶ According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.¹¹⁷\n¹⁰⁹ Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n¹¹⁰ Id., at 891.\n¹¹¹ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹² Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n¹¹³ Id., at 497.\n¹¹⁴ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n¹¹⁵ Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n¹¹⁶ In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹⁷ Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## Strict control test\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^[121]^\n## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case\nIn 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n^[118]^ Id., at 498.\n^[119]^ Id., at 500.\n^[120]^ Id., at 500.\n^[121]^ Id., at 502.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(with effect from 3 June 2006, the Republic of Serbia) with respect to a dispute concerning alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948.¹²² The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.¹²³\nAfter deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide,¹²⁴ the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia.¹²⁵ At\n¹²² The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n¹²³ For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n¹²⁴ ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n¹²⁵ Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n139\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthis point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case.¹²⁶ Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law.¹²⁷ Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.¹²⁸\nThe court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning.¹²⁹ The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility¹³⁰ is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.”¹³¹ The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY.¹³² The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.¹³³\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment.¹³⁴ The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\nthe Genocide Convention.\n¹²⁶ Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n¹²⁷ Id., at para. §385.\n¹²⁸ Id., at para. §396.\n¹²⁹ Id., at para. §406.\n¹³⁰ Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n¹³¹ ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n¹³² Id., at para. §386\n¹³³ Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n¹³⁴ ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\ncould be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting.¹³⁵ Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.”¹³⁶ Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.¹³⁷\n## Scholarly Critiques\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test¹³⁸ in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique.¹³⁹ Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”.¹⁴⁰ Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.¹⁴¹\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n¹³⁵ *Id.*, at para. §394.\n¹³⁶ *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n¹³⁷ *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n¹³⁸ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n¹³⁹ See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n¹⁴⁰ Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n¹⁴¹ Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nshould not be used to advance extra-legal agendas.”¹⁴² Talmon argued that the ICJ in the two leading cases on the attribution problem, the Nicaraguan case and Bosnian Genocide case, were in fact so identical that the latter casted some further justifications on the ruling in the former.¹⁴³\n## The Court’s conclusion\nWhen the Court applied the Nicaragua test to the conflict in the Genocide Case, the Court found that the VRS could not be categorized as a de facto organ of the FRY. In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.¹⁴⁴\n## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY)¹⁴⁵ was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić¹⁴⁶ after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.”¹⁴⁷ The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the\n¹⁴² Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J. INT’L L. 21, 885-910 (2008), at pp 885, 896, 900.\n¹⁴³ Talmon at 111. According to Talmon, the Nicaragua judgment established two distinct tests concerning the problem of attribution, the ‘strict control test’ and the ‘effective control test’ respectively.\n¹⁴⁴ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §392.\n¹⁴⁵ U.N. S.C. Resl. 827, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (May 25, 1993) [hereinafter ICTY Statute] Article 2: Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n¹⁴⁶ Id., Dusko Tadić was indicted, a citizen of the former Yugoslavia, of Serb ethnic descent, and a resident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of the alleged crimes. “It is the first determination of individual guilt or innocence in connection with serious violations of international humanitarian law by a truly international tribunal.” The Indictment by the Prosecutor against Dusko Tadić, charging him with a total of 132 counts involving grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, and crimes against humanity. The accused was charged with individual counts of persecution, inhuman treatment, cruel treatment, rape, willful killing, murder, torture, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body and health, and inhumane acts alleged to have been committed at the Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje camps and at other locations in Opština Prijedor in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n¹⁴⁷ Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949. Article 4 “[P]ersons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nVRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.¹⁴⁸\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.”¹⁴⁹ The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.¹⁵⁰\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n¹⁴⁸ ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n¹⁴⁹ Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n¹⁵⁰ Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n143\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility.¹⁵¹ This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”¹⁵²\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”¹⁵³\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.”¹⁵⁴ Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.¹⁵⁵\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n¹⁵¹ Id., at para. §98.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id., at para. §114.\n¹⁵⁴ Id., at paras. §116-123.\n¹⁵⁵ Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nprivate individuals are not based on rigid and uniform criteria.\"¹⁵⁶ The acts of private individuals are attributable to States in the instances where the State exercises control over them. Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"¹⁵⁷\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"¹⁵⁸\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.¹⁵⁹\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"¹⁶⁰\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals. Since\n¹⁵⁶ *Id.*, at para. §117.\n¹⁵⁷ *Id.*\n¹⁵⁸ *Id.*, at paras. §118, §119. The Appeals Chamber pointed out a particular situations where the individuals acts ultra vires. States may assign a private individual with the specific task of performing lawful actions on its behalf. However, if that individual acts beyond the lawful task and breach the international law, in this case, States may also maintain responsibility on this account.\n¹⁵⁹ *Id.*, at para. §121.\n¹⁶⁰ *Id.*, at para. §120.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthe characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”¹⁶¹\nThen the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice.¹⁶² In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”¹⁶³\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State.¹⁶⁴ “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.”¹⁶⁵ Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.¹⁶⁶\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to\n¹⁶¹ Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n¹⁶² Id., at para. §124.\n¹⁶³ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁴ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁵ Id., at para. §131.\n¹⁶⁶ Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfinancing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”¹⁶⁷\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment¹⁶⁸ triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply.¹⁶⁹ The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.¹⁷⁰\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.¹⁷¹\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n¹⁶⁷ Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n¹⁶⁸ Id.\n¹⁶⁹ Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.¹⁷³\n## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party.¹⁷⁴ The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey¹⁷⁵, Behrami v. France¹⁷⁶, and Bankovic v. Belgium¹⁷⁷ provides insights for such inquiry.¹⁷⁸\n¹⁷² ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n¹⁷³ Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n¹⁷⁴ The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR. For a detailed discussion on the approach taken by ECtHR see Christine Byron, *Blurring of the Boundaries: The Application of International Humanitarian Law by Human Rights Bodies*, VA. J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n# Effective-Overall Control Test\n## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996)\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey¹⁷⁹, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’¹⁸⁰\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).”¹⁸¹ Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.¹⁸²\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.¹⁸³\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nSome scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction.¹⁸⁴ Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations.¹⁸⁵ That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.¹⁸⁶\n“Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”¹⁸⁷\nThe Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.¹⁸⁸\nOne of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\neffective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(ICTY). Rather the Court advanced its own relevant test by pointing out two distinguishing elements to form its own criteria. First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’¹⁸⁹ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.¹⁹⁰\nThe control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.¹⁹¹\nThe picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”¹⁹²\nConcerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot find it necessary to be evidenced whether Turkey was in actual control of the actions of the \"TRNC\" authorities.¹⁹³ The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This \"obvious\" control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC.\"¹⁹⁴\n## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001)\nIn the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction.¹⁹⁵ Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority.¹⁹⁶ Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.¹⁹⁷\nIn the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,'¹⁹⁸ the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations.¹⁹⁹ Bankovic case was the first case before\n¹⁹³ The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n¹⁹⁴ Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n¹⁹⁵ ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

The Court attributed all acts and omissions relating to the operations in Kosovo entirely to the UN, and not its member States.²¹² It did not consider the possibility of the dual or multiple attribution of KFOR's conduct to the UN as well as to NATO and its contributing States (TNCs).²¹³\nThe court found that the alleged human rights violations were attributable to the United Nations and not to the individual TCNs, and therefore the Court was not competent ratione personae to examine the relevant actions.²¹⁴ Finally, the Court concluded that the UN had an operational command that was evidence for ultimate authority and control over the military contingents during the operations, so that it did not have jurisdiction.²¹⁵\n²¹⁰ Id., at para §144.\n²¹¹ Id., at paras. §133, §144: The Court relied on the 1244 Security Council Resolution.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one.²¹⁶ The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state.²¹⁷ Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State.²¹⁸ Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.²¹⁹\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel.²²⁰ The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.²²¹\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ.²²² Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications.²²³ According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus.²²⁴ Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.²²⁵\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons.²²⁶ In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations.²²⁷ The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.²²⁸\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n220 Id., paras. §75, §86.\n221 Id., paras §75, §86, §115.\n222 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 265.\n223 International jurisprudence and conflicting tests display such reality.\n224 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, Article 8, commentary para §2.\n225 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 267.\n226 Id., at 268.\n227 ICJ, Nicaragua case, supra note 80, para. §115.\n228 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 268.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfor responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State.²²⁹ The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.²³⁰\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State.²³¹ This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.²³²\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant²³³ who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus.²³⁴ It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”²³⁵\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control.²³⁶ According to the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nNicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control.²³⁷ In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”;²³⁸ the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.²³⁹\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.²⁴⁰\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor.²⁴¹ De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State.²⁴² Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.²⁴³\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation.²⁴⁴ Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nobjectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified.²⁴⁵ It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”.²⁴⁶ Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas.²⁴⁷ This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State.²⁴⁸ The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.²⁴⁹\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nofficial apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation.²⁵⁰ As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack.²⁵¹ This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question.²⁵² In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State.²⁵³ The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”.²⁵⁴ For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.²⁵⁵\n## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution)\n## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair\nWhen a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non-\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nstate actor to exercise the desired functions.²⁵⁶ In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey.²⁵⁷ To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.”²⁵⁸ The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁵⁹ Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”²⁶⁰\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State.²⁶¹ The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.²⁶²\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory\n### The Concept of Control\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity.²⁶³ The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.”²⁶⁴ There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient.²⁶⁵ The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question.²⁶⁶ Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”²⁶⁷\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities.²⁶⁸ A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.²⁶⁹\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group.²⁷⁰ Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.²⁷¹\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person.²⁷² Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.²⁷³\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred.²⁷⁴ The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.²⁷⁵\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends.²⁷⁶ Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy.²⁷⁷ These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey²⁷⁸ case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus.²⁷⁹ The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’.²⁸⁰ The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁸¹\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n²⁷⁶ Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic and Landzo (Celebici), ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, Case No. IT-96-21-A (February 20, 2001), at para. §47.\n²⁷⁷ Id.\n²⁷⁸ ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, supra note 80.\n²⁷⁹ ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, id., at para. §62.\n²⁸⁰ Id., at para. §56.\n²⁸¹ Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nalso trigger the responsibility of the latter.²⁸² The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’.²⁸³ Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive.²⁸⁴ Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack.²⁸⁵ It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”.²⁸⁶ While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.²⁸⁷\n## 5. Conclusion\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\na chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority.²⁸⁸ Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State.²⁸⁹ In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced.²⁹⁰ This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State.²⁹¹ As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation.²⁹² Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].”²⁹³ This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State.²⁹⁴ The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws.²⁹⁵ If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.²⁹⁶",

Introduction\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nproof. States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized. Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\nCyber attacks, whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not, have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control. Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available. These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges. Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n See generally, MICHAEL N.

Some featured cyber incidents\n### 2007 Estonia case\nIn May 2007, the country of Estonia fell victim to far-reaching computer network attacks. The incident began after the government’s decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from the center of Tallinn. It is believed that these attacks were driven by ethnic Russian hackers. Targets included government and commercial Internet infrastructure and information systems. Most of the attacks originated in Russia, including from a number of Russian government institutions, though some were conducted from elsewhere. After this attack, NATO accelerated its effort to confront cyber\n Id. “Many cybersecurity experts, however, consider the U.S. government to have the most advanced operations...

Neither country has confirmed or denied involvement, but experts have referred this attack as very likely a state-sponsored cyber attack rather than a case of cyber terrorism.\nStuxnet is a key example of the shift from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure. Cyber attacks have become an instrument in states' attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason states will probably continue to sponsor them. It remains unclear whether the Stuxnet attack constitutes an unlawful use of force because no physical damage has been confirmed.\n NATO Strategic Concept 2010, updated May 2012, “Cyber attacks continue to pose a real threat to NATO and cyber defence will continue to be a core capability of the Alliance.” available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm (visited October, 2016).\n Siobhan Gorman, U.S. Team and Israel Developed Iran Worm, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564 (visited November 2016) http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023048213045774\n Peter Beaumont, Stuxnet Worm Heralds New Era of Global Cyberwar, September 30, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar, (visited September 2016).\n Supra note 17. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564\n Josh Holliday, Stuxnet worm is the ‘work of a national government agency’, September 24, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agenc,, (visited September, 2016) “Kaspersky Lab, told the Guardian: We think that Stuxnet’s sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a State.”\n Id.\n Id.\n Russell Buchan, Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Use of Force or Prohibited Interventions, J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 2014 Sony attack\nComputer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014, allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records. North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns. An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare. International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.\n## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race. Although international law includes\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nvarious rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.\nIn regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that \"cyber space is international space.\" Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels. Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions. Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm. Instead,\n *Id.*\n *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nsuch legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively. In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act. Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation” in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework. In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”\nSince “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,” this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in\n Supra note 28, at 189.\n Supra note 23, at 212.\n Id.\n Mathew C. Waxman, Cyber Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4), 36 YALE J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nor through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.\n## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility\nThe primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it. In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations. Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.” The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and . . . apply unless excluded.”\nSuch “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable. Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nactivities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply. The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.\n## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues\nStates and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons, in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State. Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons. In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.\nCyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors\n Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Supra note 49, at 20.\n JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nin or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author. Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase. The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility. In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator. For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution\nAs stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and\n Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report (November 2010) *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016)\n Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n *Id.* at 230.\n *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\" In other words, \"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity. This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility. Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\"). Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 3.4. Existing attribution standards\nAttribution is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation. In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.” Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states. Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process. A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007. In another widely cited\n For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test\nThe Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87\nThe contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90\n## As acting on behalf of (US) government\nThe ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nStates' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict, it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States. However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact. Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States. The Court formulated the test as follow;\n“Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”\nFrom the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government. It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it;\n Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n Id., at paras. §109-121.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nrather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’. The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.\nThe contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.\n## A single test or more\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nCassese argued that the effective control test portrays one single ‘exacting test’ in the circumstances for acts performed by private individuals where a State is involved to perform specific illegal acts in the territory of another State. In such instances specific instructions concerning the performance of each action are required in order to attribute the private action to the instructing State. Cassese further contends that the ‘effective control’ test is applicable exclusively in situations of single individuals acting on behalf of a State.\nBarbour and Salzman point out that “[t]he effective control test is an “all-or-nothing” approach to State responsibility that leaves no room for the more complex forms of State involvement...” Furthermore, Tyner draws attention to the “effective control” as a single standard set out in Nicaragua case, which “was among the first articulations of a test to determine when actions of non-state actors could be attributed to a State.”\n## Two distinct tests in Nicaragua\nHowever there are some exceptions in the case law and literature, which argue that the ICJ in fact established two distinct tests. Some writers argue that the attribution of conducts of de facto organs to a State concerns two distinctive elements in the light of the Nicaragua case. These are the notions of ‘complete dependence’ on, and ‘control’ of, the State over the non-state groups. Abass points out that the purpose of the “control test” is to clarify\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n ICJ, *Nicaragua Case*, supra note 80, at paras. §118–119, 141.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at pp. 657, 653: “[B]y ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.”\n Barbour &amp; Salzman, supra note 105, at 74.\n Tyner, supra note 105, at 850.\n Stephan Talmon, *The Responsibility of Outside Powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities*, I.C.L.Q. 58, 493–517 (2009), at pp. 493–517; Marko Milanovic, *State Responsibility for Genocide*, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nwhether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State. ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it. In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”\nTalmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case. He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ. The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.” “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity. According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.\n Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n Id., at 891.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n Id., at 497.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## Strict control test\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^[121]^\n## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case\nIn 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n^[118]^ Id., at 498.\n^[119]^ Id., at 500.\n^[120]^ Id., at 500.\n^[121]^ Id., at 502.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(with effect from 3 June 2006, the Republic of Serbia) with respect to a dispute concerning alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948. The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.\nAfter deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide, the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia. At\n The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthis point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case. Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law. Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.\nThe court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning. The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.” The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY. The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment. The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\nthe Genocide Convention.\n Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n Id., at para. §385.\n Id., at para. §396.\n Id., at para. §406.\n Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n Id., at para. §386\n Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\ncould be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting. Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.” Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.\n## Scholarly Critiques\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique. Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”. Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n *Id.*, at para. §394.\n *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nshould not be used to advance extra-legal agendas.” Talmon argued that the ICJ in the two leading cases on the attribution problem, the Nicaraguan case and Bosnian Genocide case, were in fact so identical that the latter casted some further justifications on the ruling in the former.\n## The Court’s conclusion\nWhen the Court applied the Nicaragua test to the conflict in the Genocide Case, the Court found that the VRS could not be categorized as a de facto organ of the FRY. In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.\n## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY) was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.” The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the\n Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J. INT’L L. 21, 885-910 (2008), at pp 885, 896, 900.\n Talmon at 111. According to Talmon, the Nicaragua judgment established two distinct tests concerning the problem of attribution, the ‘strict control test’ and the ‘effective control test’ respectively.\n ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §392.\n U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nVRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.” The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility. This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.” Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n Id., at para. §98.\n Id.\n Id., at para. §114.\n Id., at paras. §116-123.\n Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nprivate individuals are not based on rigid and uniform criteria.\" The acts of private individuals are attributable to States in the instances where the State exercises control over them. Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals. Since\n *Id.*, at para. §117.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at paras. §118, §119. The Appeals Chamber pointed out a particular situations where the individuals acts ultra vires. States may assign a private individual with the specific task of performing lawful actions on its behalf. However, if that individual acts beyond the lawful task and breach the international law, in this case, States may also maintain responsibility on this account.\n *Id.*, at para. §121.\n *Id.*, at para. §120.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthe characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”\nThen the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice. In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State. “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.” Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to\n Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n Id., at para. §124.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §131.\n Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfinancing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply. The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n Id.\n Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.\n## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party. The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey, Behrami v. France, and Bankovic v. Belgium provides insights for such inquiry.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n# Effective-Overall Control Test\n## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996)\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).” Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nSome scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction. Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations. That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.\n“Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”\nThe Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.\nOne of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\neffective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(ICTY). Rather the Court advanced its own relevant test by pointing out two distinguishing elements to form its own criteria. First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.\nThe control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.\nThe picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”\nConcerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot find it necessary to be evidenced whether Turkey was in actual control of the actions of the \"TRNC\" authorities. The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This \"obvious\" control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC.\"\n## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001)\nIn the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority. Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.\nIn the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,' the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations. Bankovic case was the first case before\n The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one. The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state. Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State. Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel. The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ. Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications. According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus. Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons. In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations. The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfor responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State. The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State. This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus. It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control. According to the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nNicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control. In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”; the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor. De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State. Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation. Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nobjectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified. It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”. Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas. This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State. The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nofficial apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation. As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack. This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question. In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State. The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”. For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.\n## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution)\n## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair\nWhen a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non-\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nstate actor to exercise the desired functions. In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.” The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC. Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State. The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory\n### The Concept of Control\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity. The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.” There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient. The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question. Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities. A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group. Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person. Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred. The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends. Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy. These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus. The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’. The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n Prosecutor v.

This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nalso trigger the responsibility of the latter. The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’. Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive. Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack. It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”. While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.\n## 5. Conclusion\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\na chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority. Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State. In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced. This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State. As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation. Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].” This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State. The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws. If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.",

Introduction\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nproof. States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized. Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\nCyber attacks, whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not, have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control. Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available. These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges. Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n See generally, MICHAEL N.

Some featured cyber incidents\n### 2007 Estonia case\nIn May 2007, the country of Estonia fell victim to far-reaching computer network attacks. The incident began after the government’s decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from the center of Tallinn. It is believed that these attacks were driven by ethnic Russian hackers. Targets included government and commercial Internet infrastructure and information systems. Most of the attacks originated in Russia, including from a number of Russian government institutions, though some were conducted from elsewhere. After this attack, NATO accelerated its effort to confront cyber\n Id. “Many cybersecurity experts, however, consider the U.S. government to have the most advanced operations...

Neither country has confirmed or denied involvement, but experts have referred this attack as very likely a state-sponsored cyber attack rather than a case of cyber terrorism.\nStuxnet is a key example of the shift from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure. Cyber attacks have become an instrument in states' attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason states will probably continue to sponsor them. It remains unclear whether the Stuxnet attack constitutes an unlawful use of force because no physical damage has been confirmed.\n NATO Strategic Concept 2010, updated May 2012, “Cyber attacks continue to pose a real threat to NATO and cyber defence will continue to be a core capability of the Alliance.” available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm (visited October, 2016).\n Siobhan Gorman, U.S. Team and Israel Developed Iran Worm, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564 (visited November 2016) http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023048213045774\n Peter Beaumont, Stuxnet Worm Heralds New Era of Global Cyberwar, September 30, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar, (visited September 2016).\n Supra note 17. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564\n Josh Holliday, Stuxnet worm is the ‘work of a national government agency’, September 24, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agenc,, (visited September, 2016) “Kaspersky Lab, told the Guardian: We think that Stuxnet’s sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a State.”\n Id.\n Id.\n Russell Buchan, Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Use of Force or Prohibited Interventions, J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 2014 Sony attack\nComputer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014, allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records. North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns. An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare. International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.\n## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race. Although international law includes\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nvarious rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.\nIn regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that \"cyber space is international space.\" Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels. Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions. Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm. Instead,\n *Id.*\n *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nsuch legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively. In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act. Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation” in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework. In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”\nSince “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,” this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in\n Supra note 28, at 189.\n Supra note 23, at 212.\n Id.\n Mathew C.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nor through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.\n## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility\nThe primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it. In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations. Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.” The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and . . . apply unless excluded.”\nSuch “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable. Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nactivities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply. The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.\n## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues\nStates and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons, in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State. Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons. In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.\nCyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors\n Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Supra note 49, at 20.\n JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nin or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author. Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase. The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility. In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator. For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution\nAs stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and\n Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report (November 2010) *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016)\n Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n *Id.* at 230.\n *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\" In other words, \"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity. This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility. Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\"). Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 3.4. Existing attribution standards\nAttribution is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation. In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.” Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states. Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process. A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007. In another widely cited\n For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\ninternational suit, the Tadić Appeals Chamber case, the attribution criterion of an “overall control test” was established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).83 The process of attribution was also examined by the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test\nThe Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87\nThe contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90\n## As acting on behalf of (US) government\nThe ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nStates' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict, it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States. However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact. Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States. The Court formulated the test as follow;\n“Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”\nFrom the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government. It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it;\n Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n Id., at paras. §109-121.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nrather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’. The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.\nThe contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.\n## A single test or more\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nCassese argued that the effective control test portrays one single ‘exacting test’ in the circumstances for acts performed by private individuals where a State is involved to perform specific illegal acts in the territory of another State. In such instances specific instructions concerning the performance of each action are required in order to attribute the private action to the instructing State. Cassese further contends that the ‘effective control’ test is applicable exclusively in situations of single individuals acting on behalf of a State.\nBarbour and Salzman point out that “[t]he effective control test is an “all-or-nothing” approach to State responsibility that leaves no room for the more complex forms of State involvement...” Furthermore, Tyner draws attention to the “effective control” as a single standard set out in Nicaragua case, which “was among the first articulations of a test to determine when actions of non-state actors could be attributed to a State.”\n## Two distinct tests in Nicaragua\nHowever there are some exceptions in the case law and literature, which argue that the ICJ in fact established two distinct tests. Some writers argue that the attribution of conducts of de facto organs to a State concerns two distinctive elements in the light of the Nicaragua case. These are the notions of ‘complete dependence’ on, and ‘control’ of, the State over the non-state groups. Abass points out that the purpose of the “control test” is to clarify\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n ICJ, *Nicaragua Case*, supra note 80, at paras. §118–119, 141.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at pp. 657, 653: “[B]y ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.”\n Barbour &amp; Salzman, supra note 105, at 74.\n Tyner, supra note 105, at 850.\n Stephan Talmon, *The Responsibility of Outside Powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities*, I.C.L.Q. 58, 493–517 (2009), at pp. 493–517; Marko Milanovic, *State Responsibility for Genocide*, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nwhether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State. ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it. In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”\nTalmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case. He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ. The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.” “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity. According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.\n Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n Id., at 891.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n Id., at 497.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## Strict control test\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^[121]^\n## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case\nIn 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n^[118]^ Id., at 498.\n^[119]^ Id., at 500.\n^[120]^ Id., at 500.\n^[121]^ Id., at 502.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(with effect from 3 June 2006, the Republic of Serbia) with respect to a dispute concerning alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948. The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.\nAfter deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide, the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia. At\n The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthis point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case. Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law. Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.\nThe court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning. The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.” The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY. The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment. The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\nthe Genocide Convention.\n Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n Id., at para. §385.\n Id., at para. §396.\n Id., at para. §406.\n Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n Id., at para. §386\n Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\ncould be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting. Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.” Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.\n## Scholarly Critiques\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique. Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”. Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n *Id.*, at para. §394.\n *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nshould not be used to advance extra-legal agendas.” Talmon argued that the ICJ in the two leading cases on the attribution problem, the Nicaraguan case and Bosnian Genocide case, were in fact so identical that the latter casted some further justifications on the ruling in the former.\n## The Court’s conclusion\nWhen the Court applied the Nicaragua test to the conflict in the Genocide Case, the Court found that the VRS could not be categorized as a de facto organ of the FRY. In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.\n## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY) was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.” The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the\n Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nVRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.” The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility. This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.” Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n Id., at para. §98.\n Id.\n Id., at para. §114.\n Id., at paras. §116-123.\n Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nprivate individuals are not based on rigid and uniform criteria.\" The acts of private individuals are attributable to States in the instances where the State exercises control over them. Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals. Since\n *Id.*, at para. §117.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at paras. §118, §119. The Appeals Chamber pointed out a particular situations where the individuals acts ultra vires. States may assign a private individual with the specific task of performing lawful actions on its behalf. However, if that individual acts beyond the lawful task and breach the international law, in this case, States may also maintain responsibility on this account.\n *Id.*, at para. §121.\n *Id.*, at para. §120.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthe characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”\nThen the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice. In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State. “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.” Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to\n Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n Id., at para. §124.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §131.\n Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfinancing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply. The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n Id.\n Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.\n## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party. The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey, Behrami v. France, and Bankovic v. Belgium provides insights for such inquiry.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR. For a detailed discussion on the approach taken by ECtHR see Christine Byron, *Blurring of the Boundaries: The Application of International Humanitarian Law by Human Rights Bodies*, VA. J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n# Effective-Overall Control Test\n## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996)\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).” Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nSome scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction. Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations. That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.\n“Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”\nThe Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.\nOne of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\neffective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(ICTY). Rather the Court advanced its own relevant test by pointing out two distinguishing elements to form its own criteria. First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.\nThe control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.\nThe picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”\nConcerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot find it necessary to be evidenced whether Turkey was in actual control of the actions of the \"TRNC\" authorities. The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This \"obvious\" control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC.\"\n## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001)\nIn the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority. Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.\nIn the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,' the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations. Bankovic case was the first case before\n The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

Then the control over the military contingent did matter, because the entity controlling those persons had to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights in order to raise the responsibility before the convention.\nThe Court applied the ultimate authority and control test to establish whether the UN or France was responsible for the conduct held during the operations. The Court attributed all acts and omissions relating to the operations in Kosovo entirely to the UN, and not its member States. It did not consider the possibility of the dual or multiple attribution of KFOR's conduct to the UN as well as to NATO and its contributing States (TNCs).\nThe court found that the alleged human rights violations were attributable to the United Nations and not to the individual TCNs, and therefore the Court was not competent ratione personae to examine the relevant actions.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one. The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state. Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State. Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel. The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ. Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications. According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus. Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons. In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations. The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfor responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State. The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State. This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus. It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control. According to the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nNicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control. In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”; the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor. De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State. Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation. Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nobjectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified. It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”. Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas. This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State. The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nofficial apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation. As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack. This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question. In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State. The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”. For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.\n## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution)\n## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair\nWhen a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non-\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nstate actor to exercise the desired functions. In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.” The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC. Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State. The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory\n### The Concept of Control\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity. The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.” There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient. The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question. Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities. A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group. Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person. Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred. The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends. Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy. These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus. The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’. The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic and Landzo (Celebici), ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, Case No. IT-96-21-A (February 20, 2001), at para. §47.\n Id.\n ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, supra note 80.\n ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, id., at para. §62.\n Id., at para. §56.\n Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nalso trigger the responsibility of the latter. The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’. Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive. Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack. It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”. While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.\n## 5. Conclusion\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\na chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority. Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State. In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced. This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State. As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation. Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].” This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State. The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws. If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.",

Introduction\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nproof. States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized. Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\nCyber attacks, whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not, have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control. Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available. These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges. Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n See generally, MICHAEL N.

Some featured cyber incidents\n### 2007 Estonia case\nIn May 2007, the country of Estonia fell victim to far-reaching computer network attacks. The incident began after the government’s decision to remove a Soviet war memorial from the center of Tallinn. It is believed that these attacks were driven by ethnic Russian hackers. Targets included government and commercial Internet infrastructure and information systems. Most of the attacks originated in Russia, including from a number of Russian government institutions, though some were conducted from elsewhere. After this attack, NATO accelerated its effort to confront cyber\n Id. “Many cybersecurity experts, however, consider the U.S. government to have the most advanced operations...

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nattacks and initiated policies and capacity designed to create a safer cyber environment.\n## 2010 Stuxnet\nAn alleged U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran, discovered in 2010, that deployed the Stuxnet computer worm in an effort to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be the most advanced and destructive cyber attack to date. Neither country has confirmed or denied involvement, but experts have referred this attack as very likely a state-sponsored cyber attack rather than a case of cyber terrorism.\nStuxnet is a key example of the shift from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure. Cyber attacks have become an instrument in states' attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason states will probably continue to sponsor them. It remains unclear whether the Stuxnet attack constitutes an unlawful use of force because no physical damage has been confirmed.\n NATO Strategic Concept 2010, updated May 2012, “Cyber attacks continue to pose a real threat to NATO and cyber defence will continue to be a core capability of the Alliance.” available at http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm (visited October, 2016).\n Siobhan Gorman, U.S. Team and Israel Developed Iran Worm, June 1, 2012, available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564 (visited November 2016) http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023048213045774\n Peter Beaumont, Stuxnet Worm Heralds New Era of Global Cyberwar, September 30, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/30/stuxnet-worm-new-era-global-cyberwar, (visited September 2016).\n Supra note 17. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577440703810436564\n Josh Holliday, Stuxnet worm is the ‘work of a national government agency’, September 24, 2010, available at https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agency, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/24/stuxnet-worm-national-agenc,, (visited September, 2016) “Kaspersky Lab, told the Guardian: We think that Stuxnet’s sophistication, purpose and the intelligence behind it suggest the involvement of a State.”\n Id.\n Id.\n Russell Buchan, Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Use of Force or Prohibited Interventions, J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 2014 Sony attack\nComputer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014, allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records. North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns. An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare. International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.\n## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race. Although international law includes\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nvarious rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.\nIn regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that \"cyber space is international space.\" Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels. Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions. Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm. Instead,\n *Id.*\n *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nsuch legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively. In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act. Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation” in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework. In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”\nSince “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,” this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in\n Supra note 28, at 189.\n Supra note 23, at 212.\n Id.\n Mathew C.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nor through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.\n## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility\nThe primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it. In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations. Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.” The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and . . . apply unless excluded.”\nSuch “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable. Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nactivities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply. The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.\n## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues\nStates and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons, in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State. Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons. In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.\nCyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors\n Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n Supra note 49, at 20.\n JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nin or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author. Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase. The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility. In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator. For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution\nAs stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and\n Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report (November 2010) *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016)\n Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n *Id.* at 230.\n *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\" In other words, \"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity. This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility. Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\"). Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 3.4. Existing attribution standards\nAttribution is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation. In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.” Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states. Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process. A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007. In another widely cited\n For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test\nThe Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87\nThe contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90\n## As acting on behalf of (US) government\nThe ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nStates' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict, it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States. However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact. Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States. The Court formulated the test as follow;\n“Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”\nFrom the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government. It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it;\n Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n Id., at paras. §109-121.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nrather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’. The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.\nThe contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.\n## A single test or more\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.\n Id., at para. §109.\n Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nCassese argued that the effective control test portrays one single ‘exacting test’ in the circumstances for acts performed by private individuals where a State is involved to perform specific illegal acts in the territory of another State. In such instances specific instructions concerning the performance of each action are required in order to attribute the private action to the instructing State. Cassese further contends that the ‘effective control’ test is applicable exclusively in situations of single individuals acting on behalf of a State.\nBarbour and Salzman point out that “[t]he effective control test is an “all-or-nothing” approach to State responsibility that leaves no room for the more complex forms of State involvement...” Furthermore, Tyner draws attention to the “effective control” as a single standard set out in Nicaragua case, which “was among the first articulations of a test to determine when actions of non-state actors could be attributed to a State.”\n## Two distinct tests in Nicaragua\nHowever there are some exceptions in the case law and literature, which argue that the ICJ in fact established two distinct tests. Some writers argue that the attribution of conducts of de facto organs to a State concerns two distinctive elements in the light of the Nicaragua case. These are the notions of ‘complete dependence’ on, and ‘control’ of, the State over the non-state groups. Abass points out that the purpose of the “control test” is to clarify\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n ICJ, *Nicaragua Case*, supra note 80, at paras. §118–119, 141.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at pp. 657, 653: “[B]y ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.”\n Barbour &amp; Salzman, supra note 105, at 74.\n Tyner, supra note 105, at 850.\n Stephan Talmon, *The Responsibility of Outside Powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities*, I.C.L.Q. 58, 493–517 (2009), at pp. 493–517; Marko Milanovic, *State Responsibility for Genocide*, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nwhether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State. ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it. In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”\nTalmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case. He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ. The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.” “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity. According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.\n Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n Id., at 891.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n Id., at 497.\n ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## Strict control test\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor.

The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.\nAfter deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide, the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia. At\n The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthis point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case. Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law. Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.\nThe court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning. The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.” The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY. The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment. The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\nthe Genocide Convention.\n Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n Id., at para. §385.\n Id., at para. §396.\n Id., at para. §406.\n Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n Id., at para. §386\n Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\ncould be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting. Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.” Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.\n## Scholarly Critiques\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique. Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”. Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n *Id.*, at para. §394.\n *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nshould not be used to advance extra-legal agendas.” Talmon argued that the ICJ in the two leading cases on the attribution problem, the Nicaraguan case and Bosnian Genocide case, were in fact so identical that the latter casted some further justifications on the ruling in the former.\n## The Court’s conclusion\nWhen the Court applied the Nicaragua test to the conflict in the Genocide Case, the Court found that the VRS could not be categorized as a de facto organ of the FRY. In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.\n## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY) was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.” The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the\n Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J. INT’L L. 21, 885-910 (2008), at pp 885, 896, 900.\n Talmon at 111. According to Talmon, the Nicaragua judgment established two distinct tests concerning the problem of attribution, the ‘strict control test’ and the ‘effective control test’ respectively.\n ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §392.\n U.N. S.C. Resl. 827, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (May 25, 1993) [hereinafter ICTY Statute] Article 2: Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n Id., Dusko Tadić was indicted, a citizen of the former Yugoslavia, of Serb ethnic descent, and a resident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of the alleged crimes. “It is the first determination of individual guilt or innocence in connection with serious violations of international humanitarian law by a truly international tribunal.” The Indictment by the Prosecutor against Dusko Tadić, charging him with a total of 132 counts involving grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, and crimes against humanity.

Article 4 “[P]ersons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nVRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.” The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility. This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.” Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n Id., at para. §98.\n Id.\n Id., at para. §114.\n Id., at paras. §116-123.\n Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nprivate individuals are not based on rigid and uniform criteria.\" The acts of private individuals are attributable to States in the instances where the State exercises control over them. Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals. Since\n *Id.*, at para. §117.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*, at paras. §118, §119. The Appeals Chamber pointed out a particular situations where the individuals acts ultra vires. States may assign a private individual with the specific task of performing lawful actions on its behalf. However, if that individual acts beyond the lawful task and breach the international law, in this case, States may also maintain responsibility on this account.\n *Id.*, at para. §121.\n *Id.*, at para. §120.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthe characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”\nThen the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice. In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State. “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.” Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to\n Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n Id., at para. §124.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §130.\n Id., at para. §131.\n Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfinancing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply. The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n Id.\n Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.\n## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party. The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey, Behrami v. France, and Bankovic v. Belgium provides insights for such inquiry.\n ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n# Effective-Overall Control Test\n## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996)\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).” Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nSome scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction. Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations. That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.\n“Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”\nThe Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.\nOne of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\neffective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.\nThe control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.\nThe picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”\nConcerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M.

The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This \"obvious\" control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC.\"\n## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001)\nIn the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction. Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority. Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.\nIn the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,' the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations. Bankovic case was the first case before\n The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

Then the control over the military contingent did matter, because the entity controlling those persons had to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights in order to raise the responsibility before the convention.\nThe Court applied the ultimate authority and control test to establish whether the UN or France was responsible for the conduct held during the operations. The Court attributed all acts and omissions relating to the operations in Kosovo entirely to the UN, and not its member States. It did not consider the possibility of the dual or multiple attribution of KFOR's conduct to the UN as well as to NATO and its contributing States (TNCs).\nThe court found that the alleged human rights violations were attributable to the United Nations and not to the individual TCNs, and therefore the Court was not competent ratione personae to examine the relevant actions.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one. The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state. Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State. Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel. The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ. Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications. According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus. Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons. In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations. The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfor responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State. The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State. This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus. It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control. According to the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nNicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control. In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”; the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor. De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State. Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation. Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nobjectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified. It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”. Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas. This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State. The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nofficial apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation. As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack. This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question. In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State. The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”. For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.\n## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution)\n## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair\nWhen a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non-\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M.

In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.” The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC. Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State. The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory\n### The Concept of Control\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity. The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.” There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient. The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question. Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities. A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group. Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person. Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred. The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends. Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy. These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus. The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’. The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic and Landzo (Celebici), ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, Case No. IT-96-21-A (February 20, 2001), at para. §47.\n Id.\n ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, supra note 80.\n ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, id., at para. §62.\n Id., at para. §56.\n Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nalso trigger the responsibility of the latter. The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’. Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive. Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack. It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”. While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.\n## 5. Conclusion\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\na chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority. Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State. In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced. This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State. As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation. Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].” This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State. The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws. If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future."

Introduction\nThis paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nproof.¹ States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized.² Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an \"act of state.\" De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n¹ Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks\nCyber attacks,³ whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not,⁴ have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control.⁵ Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available.⁶ These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.⁷\nHacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges.⁸ Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and\n³ See generally, MICHAEL N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 2014 Sony attack\nComputer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014,²⁴ allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.²⁵ The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records.²⁶ North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.²⁷\nThese three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns.²⁸ An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare.²⁹ International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.³⁰\n## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives\nWhether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race.³¹ Although international law includes\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nvarious rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.³²\nIn regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that \"cyber space is international space.\"³³ Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels.³⁴ Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.³⁵\n## 2.3. Legal questions arise\nPrior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle³⁶ or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc. ... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions.³⁷ Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm.³⁸ Instead,\n³² *Id.*\n³³ *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n³⁴ There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n³⁵ *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n³⁶ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n³⁷ For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n³⁸ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nsuch legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively.³⁹ In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act.⁴⁰ Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.⁴¹\nIn an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation”⁴² in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework.⁴³ In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.⁴⁴\n## 2.4. States are not the only players\nIn times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”⁴⁵\nSince “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,”⁴⁶ this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in\n³⁹ Supra note 28, at 189.\n⁴⁰ Supra note 23, at 212.\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² Mathew C.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nor through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability⁴⁷ expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.⁴⁸\n## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility\nThe primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it.⁴⁹ In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations.⁵⁰ Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.”⁵¹ The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and . . . apply unless excluded.”⁵²\nSuch “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable.⁵³ Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nactivities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply.⁵⁴ The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.⁵⁵\n## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues\nStates and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons,⁵⁶ in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State.⁵⁷ Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons.⁵⁸ In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.⁵⁹\nCyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct⁶⁰ and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors\n⁵⁴ Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 49, at 20.\n⁵⁶ JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n⁵⁷ U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nin or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.⁶¹\nIt could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author.⁶² Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”⁶³\n## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution\nAttribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase.⁶⁴ The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility.⁶⁵ In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator.⁶⁶ For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution\nAs stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and\n⁶¹ Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report (November 2010) *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016)\n⁶² Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n⁶³ *Id.* at 230.\n⁶⁴ *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n⁶⁵ *Id.*\n⁶⁶ *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\"⁶⁷ In other words, \"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"⁶⁸\nThere are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.⁶⁹\nAs for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity.⁷⁰ This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility.⁷¹ Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.⁷²\nArticle 8 refers to a third autonomous element, \"control,\" in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which \"control\" plays an independent role. The ILC does not formulate the elements of \"control.\" It establishes a conceptual distinction between a subjective condition of attribution (\"effective\" or \"overall\" control) and an objective condition (one involving a factual link, \"instruction\" or \"direction\").⁷³ Thus, \"The only notable difference is in fact temporal: in one case a factual link at a particular point, while in the other, 'control' constitutes a continuous factual link.\"⁷⁴\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 3.4. Existing attribution standards\nAttribution⁷⁵ is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation.⁷⁶ In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.”⁷⁷ Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states.⁷⁸ Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”⁷⁹\nThe issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process.⁸⁰ A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁸¹ for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007.⁸² In another widely cited\n⁷⁵ For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test\nThe Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87\nThe contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90\n## As acting on behalf of (US) government\nThe ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nStates' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.⁹¹\nAlthough the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict⁹², it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States.⁹³ However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact.⁹⁴ Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States.⁹⁵ The Court formulated the test as follow;\n“Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”⁹⁶\nFrom the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government.⁹⁷ It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it;\n⁹¹ Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n⁹² Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n⁹³ Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n⁹⁴ Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n⁹⁵ Id., at paras. §109-121.\n⁹⁶ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁷ Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nrather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’.⁹⁸ The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.⁹⁹\nThe contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying¹⁰⁰ to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.¹⁰¹\n## A single test or more\nIn regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.¹⁰²\n⁹⁸ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁹ Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n¹⁰⁰ Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n¹⁰¹ Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n¹⁰² Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nwhether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State.¹⁰⁹ ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it.¹¹⁰ In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”¹¹¹\nTalmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case.¹¹² He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ.¹¹³ The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.”¹¹⁴ “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”¹¹⁵\nTalmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity.¹¹⁶ According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.¹¹⁷\n¹⁰⁹ Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n¹¹⁰ Id., at 891.\n¹¹¹ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹² Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n¹¹³ Id., at 497.\n¹¹⁴ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n¹¹⁵ Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n¹¹⁶ In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹⁷ Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## Strict control test\nTalmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^^\nOn the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^^\n## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case\nIn 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n^^ Id., at 498.\n^^ Id., at 500.\n^^ Id., at 500.\n^^ Id., at 502.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(with effect from 3 June 2006, the Republic of Serbia) with respect to a dispute concerning alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948.¹²² The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.¹²³\nAfter deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide,¹²⁴ the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia.¹²⁵ At\n¹²² The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n¹²³ For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label \"JNA.\" The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n¹²⁴ ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297. \"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"\n¹²⁵ Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n139\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthis point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case.¹²⁶ Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law.¹²⁷ Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.¹²⁸\nThe court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning.¹²⁹ The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility¹³⁰ is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.”¹³¹ The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY.¹³² The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.¹³³\nThe Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment.¹³⁴ The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS\nthe Genocide Convention.\n¹²⁶ Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n¹²⁷ Id., at para. §385.\n¹²⁸ Id., at para. §396.\n¹²⁹ Id., at para. §406.\n¹³⁰ Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n¹³¹ ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n¹³² Id., at para. §386\n¹³³ Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n¹³⁴ ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\ncould be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting.¹³⁵ Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.”¹³⁶ Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.¹³⁷\n## Scholarly Critiques\nThe ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test¹³⁸ in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique.¹³⁹ Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”.¹⁴⁰ Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.¹⁴¹\nOn the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to . . . extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message . . . that international courts\n¹³⁵ *Id.*, at para. §394.\n¹³⁶ *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n¹³⁷ *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n¹³⁸ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n¹³⁹ See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n¹⁴⁰ Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n¹⁴¹ Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nshould not be used to advance extra-legal agendas.”¹⁴² Talmon argued that the ICJ in the two leading cases on the attribution problem, the Nicaraguan case and Bosnian Genocide case, were in fact so identical that the latter casted some further justifications on the ruling in the former.¹⁴³\n## The Court’s conclusion\nWhen the Court applied the Nicaragua test to the conflict in the Genocide Case, the Court found that the VRS could not be categorized as a de facto organ of the FRY. In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.¹⁴⁴\n## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY)¹⁴⁵ was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić¹⁴⁶ after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.”¹⁴⁷ The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the\n¹⁴² Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J. INT’L L. 21, 885-910 (2008), at pp 885, 896, 900.\n¹⁴³ Talmon at 111. According to Talmon, the Nicaragua judgment established two distinct tests concerning the problem of attribution, the ‘strict control test’ and the ‘effective control test’ respectively.\n¹⁴⁴ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §392.\n¹⁴⁵ U.N. S.C. Resl. 827, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (May 25, 1993) [hereinafter ICTY Statute] Article 2: Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n¹⁴⁶ Id., Dusko Tadić was indicted, a citizen of the former Yugoslavia, of Serb ethnic descent, and a resident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of the alleged crimes. “It is the first determination of individual guilt or innocence in connection with serious violations of international humanitarian law by a truly international tribunal.” The Indictment by the Prosecutor against Dusko Tadić, charging him with a total of 132 counts involving grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, and crimes against humanity. The accused was charged with individual counts of persecution, inhuman treatment, cruel treatment, rape, willful killing, murder, torture, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body and health, and inhumane acts alleged to have been committed at the Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje camps and at other locations in Opština Prijedor in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n¹⁴⁷ Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949. Article 4 “[P]ersons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nVRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.¹⁴⁸\nThe main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.”¹⁴⁹ The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.¹⁵⁰\nare not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n¹⁴⁸ ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n¹⁴⁹ Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n¹⁵⁰ Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\n143\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility.¹⁵¹ This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”¹⁵²\nAfter being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow:\n“[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”¹⁵³\nHowever, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.”¹⁵⁴ Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.¹⁵⁵\nThe Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by\nof authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n¹⁵¹ Id., at para. §98.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id., at para. §114.\n¹⁵⁴ Id., at paras. §116-123.\n¹⁵⁵ Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M.

Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that \"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"¹⁵⁷\nIn the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect \"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"¹⁵⁸\nOn the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the \"overall control\" test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.¹⁵⁹\nThe Court highlighted that:\n\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"¹⁶⁰\nAccording to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\nthe characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”¹⁶¹\nThen the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice.¹⁶² In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”¹⁶³\nIn the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State.¹⁶⁴ “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.”¹⁶⁵ Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.¹⁶⁶\nFinally, the Court emphasized that:\n“[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to\n¹⁶¹ Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n¹⁶² Id., at para. §124.\n¹⁶³ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁴ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁵ Id., at para. §131.\n¹⁶⁶ Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfinancing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”¹⁶⁷\nThe Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment¹⁶⁸ triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply.¹⁶⁹ The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.¹⁷⁰\nAccording to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.¹⁷¹\nHowever, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the\n¹⁶⁷ Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n¹⁶⁸ Id.\n¹⁶⁹ Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.¹⁷³\n## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party.¹⁷⁴ The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey¹⁷⁵, Behrami v. France¹⁷⁶, and Bankovic v. Belgium¹⁷⁷ provides insights for such inquiry.¹⁷⁸\n¹⁷² ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n¹⁷³ Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n¹⁷⁴ The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR. For a detailed discussion on the approach taken by ECtHR see Christine Byron, *Blurring of the Boundaries: The Application of International Humanitarian Law by Human Rights Bodies*, VA. J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n# Effective-Overall Control Test\n## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996)\nIn the case of Loizidou v Turkey¹⁷⁹, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’¹⁸⁰\nThe Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).”¹⁸¹ Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.¹⁸²\nWhile the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.¹⁸³\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS\nDr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nSome scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction.¹⁸⁴ Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations.¹⁸⁵ That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.¹⁸⁶\n“Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”¹⁸⁷\nThe Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.¹⁸⁸\nOne of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\neffective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n(ICTY). Rather the Court advanced its own relevant test by pointing out two distinguishing elements to form its own criteria. First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’¹⁸⁹ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.¹⁹⁰\nThe control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.¹⁹¹\nThe picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”¹⁹²\nConcerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nnot find it necessary to be evidenced whether Turkey was in actual control of the actions of the \"TRNC\" authorities.¹⁹³ The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This \"obvious\" control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC.\"¹⁹⁴\n## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001)\nIn the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction.¹⁹⁵ Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority.¹⁹⁶ Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.¹⁹⁷\nIn the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,'¹⁹⁸ the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations.¹⁹⁹ Bankovic case was the first case before\n¹⁹³ The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n¹⁹⁴ Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n¹⁹⁵ ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

The Court attributed all acts and omissions relating to the operations in Kosovo entirely to the UN, and not its member States.²¹² It did not consider the possibility of the dual or multiple attribution of KFOR's conduct to the UN as well as to NATO and its contributing States (TNCs).²¹³\nThe court found that the alleged human rights violations were attributable to the United Nations and not to the individual TCNs, and therefore the Court was not competent ratione personae to examine the relevant actions.²¹⁴ Finally, the Court concluded that the UN had an operational command that was evidence for ultimate authority and control over the military contingents during the operations, so that it did not have jurisdiction.²¹⁵\n²¹⁰ Id., at para §144.\n²¹¹ Id., at paras. §133, §144: The Court relied on the 1244 Security Council Resolution.

Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks\nIt appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one.²¹⁶ The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state.²¹⁷ Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution)\n### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State.²¹⁸ Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.²¹⁹\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel.²²⁰ The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.²²¹\nDe facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ.²²² Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications.²²³ According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus.²²⁴ Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.²²⁵\nThe Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons.²²⁶ In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations.²²⁷ The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.²²⁸\nAccording to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement\n220 Id., paras. §75, §86.\n221 Id., paras §75, §86, §115.\n222 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 265.\n223 International jurisprudence and conflicting tests display such reality.\n224 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, Article 8, commentary para §2.\n225 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 267.\n226 Id., at 268.\n227 ICJ, Nicaragua case, supra note 80, para. §115.\n228 De Frouville, supra note 68, at 268.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nfor responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State.²²⁹ The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.²³⁰\nAlthough this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State.²³¹ This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.²³²\nAnother example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant²³³ who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus.²³⁴ It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”²³⁵\n## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory\nDe facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence\nThe ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control.²³⁶ According to the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nNicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control.²³⁷ In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”;²³⁸ the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.²³⁹\nBeyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.²⁴⁰\n## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction)\nDe facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor.²⁴¹ De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State.²⁴² Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.²⁴³\nIn this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation.²⁴⁴ Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nobjectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified.²⁴⁵ It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”.²⁴⁶ Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas.²⁴⁷ This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State.²⁴⁸ The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.²⁴⁹\nHowever, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nofficial apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation.²⁵⁰ As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack.²⁵¹ This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question.²⁵² In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State.²⁵³ The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”.²⁵⁴ For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.²⁵⁵\n## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution)\n## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair\nWhen a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non-\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nstate actor to exercise the desired functions.²⁵⁶ In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey.²⁵⁷ To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.”²⁵⁸ The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁵⁹ Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey ... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”²⁶⁰\nIn the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State.²⁶¹ The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.²⁶²\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\n## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory\n### The Concept of Control\nWhile de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity.²⁶³ The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.”²⁶⁴ There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient.²⁶⁵ The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question.²⁶⁶ Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”²⁶⁷\nControl takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities.²⁶⁸ A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.²⁶⁹\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group.²⁷⁰ Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.²⁷¹\nA further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person.²⁷² Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.²⁷³\n## Attribution in extra-territorial context\nTerritorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred.²⁷⁴ The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.²⁷⁵\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nIn Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends.²⁷⁶ Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy.²⁷⁷ These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey²⁷⁸ case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus.²⁷⁹ The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’.²⁸⁰ The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁸¹\nIn the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may\n²⁷⁶ Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic and Landzo (Celebici), ICTY Appeals Chamber Judgment, Case No. IT-96-21-A (February 20, 2001), at para. §47.\n²⁷⁷ Id.\n²⁷⁸ ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, supra note 80.\n²⁷⁹ ECHR Loizidou v Turkey, id., at para. §62.\n²⁸⁰ Id., at para. §56.\n²⁸¹ Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nalso trigger the responsibility of the latter.²⁸² The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’.²⁸³ Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive.²⁸⁴ Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack.²⁸⁵ It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”.²⁸⁶ While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.²⁸⁷\n## 5. Conclusion\nAccording to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\na chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority.²⁸⁸ Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State.²⁸⁹ In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced.²⁹⁰ This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State.²⁹¹ As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation.²⁹² Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].”²⁹³ This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State.²⁹⁴ The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI\nA strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws.²⁹⁵ If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.²⁹⁶"

Emrah TANYILDIZI¹ ## ABSTRACT This paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nThis paper introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and *control theory* (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an “act of state.” This paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission’s (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts.\n## ÖZET Bu makale uluslararası hukukun işlevselliği ve etkinliği bağlamında devlet organı olmayan özel kişilerin siber aktiviteleri ve bu konuda devletlerin sorumluluğunu doğuran esasları irdelemektedir.

Introduction This paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. Although the legal consequences of such action vary, this paper is of interest regarding the extent to which cyber activities fall under the international responsibilities of states. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all.\nIn fact, cyberspace and relevant international law has remained to develop further for today's needs, it lacks clearness for the applicable law. In the context of responsibility one has to recall that substantive and evidentiary issues differ in its scope. The issues of evidence and the issues of substance of law are different in nature. One has to examine first the applicable law to the facts related with cyber activities before reviewing the standard of Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI proof.¹ States for a long time avoided from making any assertion and swift conclusion on the responsibility of another state evidencing involvement for a certain cyberattack. However, recent developments indicate that the capacity of tracking those perpetrators and holding them accountable has been potentially materialized.² Since attribution in cyberspace is rather difficult to challenge its evidential value, the paper focuses on the substance of law and its potential application.\nThis paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission's (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. Moreover, it introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an\"act of state.\"De facto theory requires the specifics of complete dependence, specific operation, and instruction. Control theory, on the other hand, prioritizes the specifics of control, organizational capacity, and extraterritorial context in its application.\nSince non-state actors have assumed a prominent role in modern day conflicts, states may elude responsibility by acting through them. If the requirement for attribution is set relatively high, states can simply evade responsibility. While it remains unclear whether state practice will adopt the lower or higher standards of proof in terms of accountability for sponsorship of cyber attacks, this paper is nevertheless able to examine the applicability of the two theories of attribution for state responsibility as applied to cyber attacks.\n¹ Kuba Macák, *Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors*, J.

Identifying Cyber Attacks Cyber attacks,³ whether they are to be considered armed attacks or not,⁴ have become increasingly sophisticated and are increasingly characterized by considerable organizational competence, command, and control.⁵ Hackers are becoming more skilled, and the technology to conduct cyber operations is readily available.⁶ These cyber activities bring threats against online infrastructure, even as the new technologies that hackers exploit bring considerable benefits.⁷ Hacking activities include mining and stealing information, erasing computers, incapacitating electrical networks, disabling bank networks, jamming radar systems, and destroying nuclear centrifuges.⁸ Many countries have modified their military protocols in order to deal with this new and ³ See generally, MICHAEL N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI ## 2014 Sony attack Computer files and records at Sony Corporation’s Hollywood film division were destroyed by cyber attacks in 2014,²⁴ allegedly in retaliation for The Interview, a comic movie about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.²⁵ The breach is considered one of the most successful state-sponsored attacks. The FBI has claimed that North Korea successfully implanted malware on Sony computers that enabled the theft and destruction of company records.²⁶ North Korea has also been accused by South Korea of attempting to hack into a nuclear reactor, television networks, and banks.²⁷ These three incidents make clear why states are turning to military solutions to their cyber security concerns.²⁸ An effective legal response to an attack depends on international cooperation. A problem immediately arises, however, with regard to the definition of such basic concepts as cyber attack, cyber crime, and cyber warfare.²⁹ International cooperation is necessary to form the basis for information sharing, evidence collection, and criminal prosecution of those involved in cyber attacks. A new international law of cyberspace is evolving under these conditions.³⁰ ## 2.2. How states react: two main perspectives Whether defensively or offensively, states have begun to react to international cyber threats in two main ways. Some states pursue peaceful measures, such as sanctions or new treaties. Other states tend to see the problem as one step in an arms race.³¹ Although international law includes Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI various rules that apply to cases in which a state breaches its international obligations, cyber activities complicate the situation by introducing such extra elements as the active participation of non-state actors, technological developments, and a state's ability to conduct military operations.³² In regard to the application of the law, one should recognize that\"cyber space is international space.\"³³ Cyber activities must therefore comply with relevant international law. The two perspectives outlined above allow for parallel international inquiries that can offer insights into the ways in which international law reacts to cyber threats. First, there is an obvious need to regulate the cyber activities on both the domestic and international levels.³⁴ Second, interpretation and application of the existing international law is necessary to establish an effective course of legal action for countering cyber threats.³⁵ ## 2.3. Legal questions arise Prior arguments have privileged such legal inquiries as whether a cyber attack constitutes an unlawful use of force or an armed attack, how the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* rules apply to cyber activities, whether a cyber attack violates the non-intervention principle³⁶ or triggers the right of self defense, and whether the sponsoring State is responsible for such activity etc.... Though these questions all fall within the scope of the obligations of States and the sequence of the relevant primary rules, the problem remains regarding how cyber activities can best be attributed to the responsible party or parties.\nMilitary methods and related legal inquiries may fail to provide an effective course of action because such discussions are based on an analogical rationale that potentially fails to point to clear definitions.³⁷ Application of the law may suffer if these discussions are limited to the use of force paradigm.³⁸ Instead, ³² *Id.* ³³ *Supra* note 28, at 189.\n³⁴ There are no treaty provisions that directly deal with cyber ‘warfare’, and also no precise customary rules to apply since its scope is limited on State practice and opinion juris. See *supra* note 3, Schmitt, *Classification of Cyber Conflict*, at 264.\n³⁵ *Supra* note 28, at 187. This could be done by characterizing cyber activities “primarily as a sphere of economic and communication activity where civil law enforcement officials have primary jurisdiction..., alternatively, be characterized as primarily under the jurisdiction of military defence authorities.”\n³⁶ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\n³⁷ For a detailed discussion see O’Connell, *supra* note 28. The development of State practice is so much important because the most crucial question is do States need to observe international law rules with respect to the cyber activities. States follow “the Cold War strategy of threatening enemies with overwhelming force and preparing to act on these threats.”\n³⁸ *Supra* note 23, at 213.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI such legal norms as responsibility, non-intervention, and countermeasures can help to solve cyber problems effectively.³⁹ In addition, it is important not to overlook the risks involved in militarizing cyber security.\nThe use of force paradigm defines the legal status of cyber attacks under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, according to which an “effects-based prohibition” requires physical damage resulting from an unlawful act.⁴⁰ Cyber attacks may not always, however, cause physical damage, though they may still constitute unlawful attacks in that they violate customary international law.⁴¹ In an effort to go beyond discussions of whether cyber attacks constitute a use of force, I argue that they in any case amount to unlawful acts, and that existing law can be subject to an “interpretive reorientation”⁴² in order to arrive at a new, effective, and comprehensive legal framework.⁴³ In this respect, I submit that the attribution principles in the law of international responsibility can help to identify the author of an internationally wrongful act and can adequately assign responsibility to this party. These findings can serve as a legal basis for various applications of the law, including the use of force, non-intervention, and self-defense paradigms.⁴⁴ ## 2.4. States are not the only players In times of privatization of State functions and delegation of sovereign activities, how States react to the impairment of their interest is a crucial consideration that affects their responsibilities under international law. Holding States and individuals legally accountable for their conduct is deemed significantly valuable as part of a “general direction toward good governance and transparency.”⁴⁵ Since “the law of international responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities,”⁴⁶ this legal framework is expected to provide practical formulations that enhance the accountability of States for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in ³⁹ Supra note 28, at 189.\n⁴⁰ Supra note 23, at 212.\n⁴¹ Id.\n⁴² Mathew C.

Emrah TANYILDIZI or through cyberspace. A broader conception of accountability⁴⁷ expands the scope of the inter-state paradigm as it is conceived in the law of international responsibility.⁴⁸ ## 3. Attribution in the System of International Responsibility The primary subjects of international law are naturally States that are obliged to comply with it.⁴⁹ In this context, breaches of international law by a State depend on the actual content of that state’s international obligations.⁵⁰ Thus it has been said that “There is no such thing as a uniform code of international law, reflecting the obligations of all States.”⁵¹ The above discussions of cyber activities have not taken into account the fact that the international obligations of States vary markedly and that this variation is a significant concern when it comes to confronting such a new and unprecedented threat.\nThere remains the problem of establishing a system of cyber law and identifying the scope of States’ international obligations in the context of cyberspace. Though these obligations may vary, there are certain concepts underlying States’ responsibilities—attribution, breach, and consequences—that “are assumed and... apply unless excluded.”⁵² Such “standard assumptions of responsibility,” then, are generally applicable.⁵³ Thus, since no special rules of international law address cyber Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI activities and there is no clear definition of an internationally wrongful cyber act or its legal consequences, these general standards of responsibility would seem to apply.⁵⁴ The establishment of state responsibility is crucial for considering remedies to be sought for past breaches and ways to prevent internationally wrongful conduct in the future.⁵⁵ ## 3.1. Attribution is the crux of the legal issues States and non-states alike are made up of natural persons. While both perform activities with the help of natural persons,⁵⁶ in order to consider the conduct of a natural person to be an act of a State, this conduct must of course be legally attributable to that State.⁵⁷ Persons who do not have either de jure or de facto organ status are considered private persons.⁵⁸ In this respect, the circumstances under which the acts of private persons and entities are attributable to a State are clarified by the particular attribution standards in the law of international responsibility.⁵⁹ Cyber activities usually appear to be private activities, raising the questions of when subjects of international law bear responsibility for seemingly private conduct⁶⁰ and how to attribute wrongful acts committed by non-state actors ⁵⁴ Article 55 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n⁵⁵ Supra note 49, at 20.\n⁵⁶ JAMES CRAWFORD, STATE RESPONSIBILITY: THE GENERAL PART (2013) at 113: A State, as the conventional and main international actor, is a corporate entity that functions on the reliance of involvement of individuals and entities, who might have private or public capacity while acting.\n⁵⁷ U.N. 56th Sess., International Law Commission, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session: Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, U.N.

Emrah TANYILDIZI in or through cyberspace to a sponsoring state. Attribution of cyber attacks remains one of the most difficult tasks in identifying a perpetrator and assessing responsibility.⁶¹ It could be argued that attribution is a problem concerning the probity of cyber evidence during the conduct of cyber investigations. It is not only, however, a tool for identifying the origin of a specific cyber attack, but it also assigns the attack to an author.⁶² Attribution is critical not only “for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness.”⁶³ ## 3.2. A problem of evidence or a problem of attribution Attribution of cyber attacks is, then, an extraordinarily difficult process, and is likely to become more so as the complexity of information technologies continues to increase.⁶⁴ The identification of a cyber attacker is particularly important in cases where hackers aligned with a foreign country have engaged in espionage directed against the computers of opposing forces and then used stolen tactical information and intelligence in the ongoing armed conflict.\nAgain, the threshold of attribution required for a political response to a cyber attack may differ from that required for legal responsibility.⁶⁵ In the light of differing standards of attribution, technical issues give rise to concerns regarding how best to prepare cyber evidence for a legal determination of attribution. As to the availability of such evidence, a problem arises regarding how to tie material proof to a specific perpetrator.⁶⁶ For such purposes, varying regimes exist for attribution under the law of international responsibility.\n## 3.3. ILC articles on attribution As stated by the ILC, “attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and ⁶¹ Paul Cornish, David Livingstone, Dave Clemente and Claire Yorke *On Cyber Warfare*, A Chatham House Report *available at* http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/International%20Security/r1110_cyberwarfare.pdf “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.” (visited September, 2016) ⁶² Tsagourias, *supra* note 3, at 233. “Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks - as the case of terrorism demonstrates - and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain.”\n⁶³ *Id.* at 230.\n⁶⁴ *Id.* “Cyber attacks take place at different levels of sophistication and can be driven by a wide variety of political, ideological, economic and even frivolous motives.”\n⁶⁵ *Id.* ⁶⁶ *Id.*, at 234.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI not on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\"⁶⁷ In other words,\"attribution constitutes a question of law before being a question of fact... [I] t can only occur in the application of rules and fixed criteria of international law.\"⁶⁸ There are two main aspects of the classification of state organs according to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which describe the circumstances under which individuals or entities are classified as de jure or de facto state organs. With regard to the first, Articles 4 through 7 present the fundamentals of attribution in terms of organs and agencies of state that exercise sovereign authority.⁶⁹ As for the second aspect, Article 8 articulates another consideration about the creation of a de facto organ or agent through the direction and instruction of another entity.⁷⁰ This form of attribution has garnered significant attention in the context of the activities of non-state actors for determinations of state responsibility.⁷¹ Despite the rejection of a similar identification of a de facto organ in the articles relating to the first aspect, Article 8 nevertheless posits a de facto organ theory—by utilizing instruction and direction notions—that includes the basic understanding found in Articles 4 through 7.⁷² Article 8 refers to a third autonomous element,\"control,\"in addition to the notions of instruction and direction. The latter notions call for classifying individuals as de facto organs depending on whether they act according to the instruction and direction given by the intervening state, and they thereby indicate a separate consideration for attribution in which\"control\"plays an independent role.

Existing attribution standards Attribution⁷⁵ is, then, the process of assessing the conduct of a natural person or entity that possesses private or public competence in order to determine the legality of a particular state operation.⁷⁶ In other words, the legal function of attribution is to consider whether the conduct of a natural person or entity has a public dimension that is identical to an “act of state.”⁷⁷ Thus Christenson argued that attribution allocates responsibility between the public and private orbit in regard to substantive international obligations of states.⁷⁸ Similarly, Crawford observes that “the rules of attribution play a key role in distinguishing the ‘State sector’ from the ‘non-State sector’ for the purposes of responsibility.”⁷⁹ The issue of legal differentiation between state action and private conduct has long been a concern of international tribunals, which have presented substantial but varying interpretations of the attribution process.⁸⁰ A case concerning Nicaragua that was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ),⁸¹ for example, used an attribution standard called an “effective control test” in order to assess the responsibility of the United States for crimes committed by the contras. ICJ re-examined the already established standard at its more recent case concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) in 2007.⁸² In another widely cited ⁷⁵ For a detailed discussion see Daniel Bodansky &amp; John R.

Emrah TANYILDIZI international suit, the Tadić Appeals Chamber case, the attribution criterion of an “overall control test” was established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).83 The process of attribution was also examined by the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey and Behrami v. France, in which an “effective-overall control test”84 and “ultimate authority and control test”85 were established, respectively. Unfortunately, each test includes its own criteria for determining the factual and control relationships between states and private actors.\n## 3.4.1. ICJ and the ‘effective control’ test The Nicaragua case was concerned with the relationship between the United States and the armed groups operating in the territory of Nicaraguan state between 1981 and 1984.86 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) took into consideration the acts attributable to the United States including; mining of ports, attacks on oil installations and other objectives, over flights, support of armed bands opposed to government of applicant State, encouragement of conduct contrary to principles of humanitarian law and economic pressure.87 The contras were one of the armed opposition groups operating against the Nicaraguan government.88 They were a trained fighting force, operating along the borders of Nicaragua.89 According to the Court’s records, it was clear from the official statements by the President and high United States officials, that the United States Government had been giving support to the contras.90 ## As acting on behalf of (US) government The ICJ was asked to answer whether the intervention by the United States into the conflict in the territory of Nicaragua would establish the United Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI States' responsibility, because of the relationship of her own officials and the non-state actors engaged in the conflict.⁹¹ Although the Court acknowledged that the assistance of United States officials for the activities of the contras took different forms during the conflict⁹², it found that it was not convincing that all the operations launched by the contras force, displayed strategy and tactics only developed by the United States.⁹³ However, on the other hand, the Court held that the financial support given by the United States to the military and paramilitary activities of the contras in Nicaragua was an entirely established fact.⁹⁴ Since the Court had to clearly examine the character of the relationship between the United States and contras forces, it devised a test to determine whether the contras forces acted on behalf of the United States or were considered an organ of the United States.\nThe ICJ established the ‘effective control test’ in order to determine whether the acts of the contras were attributable to the United States.⁹⁵ The Court formulated the test as follow; “Whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government.”⁹⁶ From the court’s point of view, the degree of control necessitates the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid in order to equate the contras with an organ of the United States Government.⁹⁷ It appears that the given aid by the United States was not sufficient enough to consider contras forces were solely dependent on it; ⁹¹ Id., at para. §21. There are two aspects with regard to this relationship for the purposes of international responsibility. First, the responsibility of the United States arising from its officials’ conduct, and secondly the responsibility arising from the conduct of armed opposition groups. For the latter inquiry, the Court looked into the doctrine of attribution in order to clarify in which degree the United States’ engagement with these armed oppositions groups prompts its responsibility.\n⁹² Id., at para. §106. “[S]uch as logistic support, the supply of information on the location and movements of the Sandinista troops, the use of sophisticated methods of communication, the deployment of field broadcasting networks, radar coverage, etc.”\n⁹³ Id., at para. §106. “The Court found it clear that a number of military and paramilitary operations by this force were decided and planned, if not actually by United States advisers, then at least in close collaboration with them...”\n⁹⁴ Id., at paras. §107, 108.\n⁹⁵ Id., at paras. §109-121.\n⁹⁶ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁷ Id., at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI rather, the contras continued to ‘constitute an independent force’.⁹⁸ The Court relied on the evidence that after the cessation of aid by the United States, the contras continued to operate in Nicaragua.⁹⁹ The contras were not created, and military strategy and tactics were not entirely developed by the United States. In this respect, the Court found that the aid given by the United States was not satisfying¹⁰⁰ to conclude that the contras were not completely dependent to the United States, which could not be considered as acting on behalf of the United States.¹⁰¹ ## A single test or more In regard with the ICJ formulation of the effective control test the literature and some other international courts mostly indicate to one single test.¹⁰² ⁹⁸ Id., at para. §109.\n⁹⁹ Id., at para. §110. “[T]he evidence available to the Court indicates that the various forms of assistance provided to the contras by the United States have been crucial to the pursuit of their activities, but is insufficient to demonstrate their complete dependence on United States aid.” Such formulation comes after the Court reiterated that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the United States “created” the contras force in Nicaragua. Likewise, the evidence was not satisfying that the United States gave “direct and critical combat support” to contras.\n¹⁰⁰ Id., at para. §115, 109. The effective control test holds a high threshold for the attribution of conduct by non-State actors to a State. It requires evidence that the contras held a partial autonomy where the United States could only participate in the crimes committed by contras, unless it had directed or enforced such crimes. The Court came to the conclusion that the Nicaraguan government failed to prove that the United States “actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on the United States’ behalf”; thus, the actions of the contras could not be attributed to the United States.\n¹⁰¹ Id., at paras. §93-110, at para. §116: The Court concluded that it “...does not consider that the assistance given by the United States to the contras warrants the conclusion that these forces are subject to the United States to such an extent that any acts they have committed are imputable to that State. It takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, and that the United States is not responsible for the acts of the contras, but for its own conduct vis-à-vis Nicaragua, including conduct related to the acts of the contras.”\n¹⁰² Antonio Cassese, The Nicaragua and Tadic Tests Revisited in Light of the ICJ Judgment on Genocide in Bosnia, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI Cassese argued that the effective control test portrays one single ‘exacting test’ in the circumstances for acts performed by private individuals where a State is involved to perform specific illegal acts in the territory of another State.¹⁰³ In such instances specific instructions concerning the performance of each action are required in order to attribute the private action to the instructing State.¹⁰⁴ Cassese further contends that the ‘effective control’ test is applicable exclusively in situations of single individuals acting on behalf of a State.¹⁰⁵ Barbour and Salzman point out that “[t]he effective control test is an “all-or-nothing” approach to State responsibility that leaves no room for the more complex forms of State involvement...”¹⁰⁶ Furthermore, Tyner draws attention to the “effective control” as a single standard set out in Nicaragua case, which “was among the first articulations of a test to determine when actions of non-state actors could be attributed to a State.”¹⁰⁷ ## Two distinct tests in Nicaragua However there are some exceptions in the case law and literature, which argue that the ICJ in fact established two distinct tests.¹⁰⁸ Some writers argue that the attribution of conducts of de facto organs to a State concerns two distinctive elements in the light of the Nicaragua case. These are the notions of ‘complete dependence’ on, and ‘control’ of, the State over the non-state groups. Abass points out that the purpose of the “control test” is to clarify ¹⁰³ Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n¹⁰⁴ ICJ, *Nicaragua Case*, supra note 80, at paras. §118–119, 141.\n¹⁰⁵ Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at pp. 657, 653: “[B]y ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.”\n¹⁰⁶ Barbour &amp; Salzman, supra note 105, at 74.\n¹⁰⁷ Tyner, supra note 105, at 850.\n¹⁰⁸ Stephan Talmon, *The Responsibility of Outside Powers for Acts of Secessionist Entities*, I.C.L.Q. 58, 493–517 (2009), at pp. 493–517; Marko Milanovic, *State Responsibility for Genocide*, EUR.

Emrah TANYILDIZI whether the non-state entity acts under the instruction of a foreign State.¹⁰⁹ ‘Complete dependence’, on the other hand, puts forward specification on whether the persons or entities that committed the wrongful acts had such ties with the foreign State that they can be deemed to have been completely dependent on it.¹¹⁰ In fact, the ICJ employed such terminology when questioning: “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one hand and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government...”¹¹¹ Talmon argued that there are two distinct tests with regard to the Nicaragua case.¹¹² He points out that this approach was approved one more time in the latter Genocide case, before the ICJ.¹¹³ The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case, in the opinion of Talmon, by utilizing the intercorrelation between dependency and control. From one side, control is the consequent of dependence, from the other side, “dependence generates the potential for control.”¹¹⁴ “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin.”¹¹⁵ Talmon discusses that the Court put forward the question of responsibility as a question of ‘degree’; in other words, the ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power. It is parallel with the question of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the non-state entity.¹¹⁶ According to Talmon, The ICJ distinguished two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence, in his words, the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.¹¹⁷ ¹⁰⁹ Abass, supra note 111, at 892.\n¹¹⁰ Id., at 891.\n¹¹¹ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹² Talmon, supra note 111, at 497-498. “According to the ICJ, control results from dependence or, looking at it from the other side, dependence creates the potential for control. Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin. For the Court, the question of responsibility is a question of ‘degree’, namely the secessionist entity’s ‘degree of dependency’ on the outside power, which, in turn, is indicative of the outside power’s ‘degree of potential control’ over the secessionist entity, and the ‘degree of control’ the outside power actually exercises over the secessionist entity. The ICJ distinguishes two degrees of control and dependency—strict control based on complete dependence and effective control in cases of partial dependence—which, in turn, give rise to two control tests which may be referred to as the ‘strict control’ and ‘effective control’ tests.”\n¹¹³ Id., at 497.\n¹¹⁴ ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at paras. §106-115; see also, ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, paras. §375, §391, §393.\n¹¹⁵ Talmon, supra note 111, at 497.\n¹¹⁶ In the words of the ICJ: “the potential for control inherent in the degree of the contras’ dependence on aid” ICJ, Nicaragua Case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\n¹¹⁷ Talmon, supra note 111, at 498.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI ## Strict control test Talmon admits that the term ‘strict control’ can be used interchangeably with ‘dependence and control test’ and ‘agency test’. The strict control test advocates equating the authorities of the non-state entities and the outside power that acts on its behalf. The strict control test is formulated according to the relationship between “so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other.” Consequently, the relevant evidence should indicate the conditions where the outside power exercises such strict control over the non-state entity’s authorities.\nAccording to Talmon, in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ recognized three requirements of strict control: first of all, there should be a complete dependence on the outside power. Secondly, all activities of the non-state entity should be covered by this complete dependence criterion. Finally, because of the potential for control is inherent in that complete dependence, outside power must have employed a particularly high degree of control. In the instances where these three requirements are fulfilled non-state entities can be equated as a de facto organ of the outside power.^[118]^ On the other hand, in the effective control test, in regards to the relationship between the intervening State and the non-state actor, the focal point is not the question of dependence anymore. It is a question of control.^[119]^ Talmon submits that the ‘effective control’ test is a subsidiary test. The ICJ formulated it for the instances where the agency relationship (strict control) cannot be proved.^[120]^ The ‘effective control’ test is not only a test to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State, but also for the determination of the responsibility for specific conduct on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, there is partial dependency of the non-state actor. The relevant conduct to identify is not the one exercised by the non-state actor, but rather the one employed by de jure organs of the intervening State over the non-state actor. Therefore, “the object of control is no longer the secessionist entity but the activities or operations giving rise to the internationally wrongful act.”^[121]^ ## Effective control test revisited in Genocide Case In 1993, the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed an application initiating proceedings against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ^[118]^ Id., at 498.\n^[119]^ Id., at 500.\n^[120]^ Id., at 500.\n^[121]^ Id., at 502.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI (with effect from 3 June 2006, the Republic of Serbia) with respect to a dispute concerning alleged violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948.¹²² The case centered on atrocities that took place during the time of the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the early 1990s.¹²³ After deciding that the massacres committed in the Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide,¹²⁴ the Court examined whether such massacres gave rise to the international responsibility of the Respondent State, Serbia.¹²⁵ At ¹²² The Court was asked to examine the facts alleged by the Applicant State, whether the alleged atrocities occurred within the scope of Article II of the Genocide Convention. In the ICJ Genocide case, supra note 82, the Court dealt with, for the very first time, State responsibility under the Genocide Convention. See generally Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dec. 9, 1948, 102 Stat. 3045, 78 U.N.T.S. 277 [hereinafter Genocide Convention]. As of July 18, 2007, 140 States were parties to the Convention; ICJ Genocide Case, supra note 82. After the breakdown of FRY, independent sovereign States had emerged. These are Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska Krajina Crotia, and the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later to be called the Republika Srpska. The Republika Srpska did not enjoy any international recognition as a sovereign State. However, it had de facto control of substantial territory, and the loyalty of a large numbers of Bosnian Serbs.\n¹²³ For detailed historical analysis see RICHARD HOLBROOKE, TO END A WAR (1998); AMANTHA POWER, A PROBLEM FROM HELL: AMERICA AND THE AGE OF GENOCIDE (2002); ROGER CAROLE POIRIER, THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA (1998); Commission of Experts, Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780, (1992) U.N. Doc. S/1994/674, (27 May 1994). ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §237 When the Bosnian people declared independence, Bosnian Serb nationalists, who were against the Bosnian independence, declared their own separate Bosnian Serb State (the Republika Srpska- VRS) within the borders of old Bosnia. FRY supported the VRS by dispatching troops and other equipment belonging to the now Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) to Bosnia. Although the soldiers changed their badges, their army vehicles continued to carry signs of the label\"JNA.\"The case was concerned with the existence of close ties between the Respondent State Serbia and the authorities of the Republika Srpska, of a political, military and financial nature. It created an administrative correlation and control of the army of the Republika Srpska (VRS).\n¹²⁴ ICJ, Genocide Case, supra note 82, at para. §297.\"[T]he Court concludes that the acts committed at Srebrenica falling within Article II (a) and (b) of the Convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the VRS in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.\"¹²⁵ Id., at para. §379. The court investigated on which basis, the Respondent State's international responsibility can be subjected to the connection with the massacres committed in the Srebrenica area. The ICJ took three steps for further analysis because of their strong interconnection. First, in regards with the law of State responsibility, the question is whether the acts of persons who committed the genocide, could be attributed to the respondent State. Second, the Court examined the conditions to discover whether the material scope of Article III of the Genocide Convention, including the acts amount to be punishable, were perpetrated by persons whose conduct is attributable to the respondent State. The final one is the inquiry of the relevant circumstances where the respondent State was obliged to prevent and punish genocide according to the Article I of Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI this point, the relationship between FRY (now Serbia) and the VRS became the center of the case.¹²⁶ Concerning the relationship between FRY and VRS, the Court recalled that the FRY made “considerable military and financial support available to the Republika Srpska.” However, regardless of this material link, the Republika Srpska and the VRS were not de jure organs of the FRY as designated under the FRY’s internal law.¹²⁷ Thus, the Court had recourse to the international law of attribution to establish whether there was a de facto relationship.¹²⁸ The court utilized the ILC articles on State Responsibility to give grounds for its reasoning.¹²⁹ The Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility¹³⁰ is the main reference for the Court alongside with the jurisprudence of the Nicaragua case. The Court quoted from the Nicaragua judgment that the responsibility of the Respondent could arise if it were proved that it had itself “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the Applicant State.”¹³¹ The Court admitted that there was sufficient evidence that the FRY was providing substantial support, inter alia, financial support, to the Republika Srpska. Despite this fact, payment of salaries and other benefits to some officers of the VRS, did not automatically make them organs of the FRY.¹³² The court emphasized that the chain of command and those officers subordinated to the political leadership of the Republika Srpska kept partial independence.¹³³ The Court referred to the previous judgment in the Nicaragua case by quoting the famous paragraph 109 of that judgment.¹³⁴ The Court reached the conclusion in the negative that neither the Republika Srpska nor the VRS the Genocide Convention.\n¹²⁶ Id., at paras. §385-412. The court dealt with this inquiry in between these paragraphs by dividing into two subsections; “The question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of the conduct of its organs and on the other hand, the question of attribution of the Srebrenica genocide to the Respondent on the basis of direction or control.”\n¹²⁷ Id., at para. §385.\n¹²⁸ Id., at para. §396.\n¹²⁹ Id., at para. §406.\n¹³⁰ Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 57, conduct directed or controlled by a State “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”\n¹³¹ ICJ, Genocide case, supra note 82, at para. §399.\n¹³² Id., at para. §386 ¹³³ Id. at para. §388. They exercised elements of the public authority of the Republika Srpska. The court came up with the conclusion that those officers must be taken to have received their orders from the Republika Srpska or the VRS, not from the FRY.\n¹³⁴ ICJ Nicaragua case, supra note 80, at para. §109.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI could be regarded as ‘mere instruments’ through which the FRY was acting.¹³⁵ Furthermore, Republika Srpska or the VRS were partially independent and the FRY did not have a real autonomy on them. And the former had a real “qualified, but real, margin of independence.”¹³⁶ Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs’ political and military organizations cannot be equated with organs of the FRY.¹³⁷ ## Scholarly Critiques The ICJ’s endorsement of the Nicaragua test¹³⁸ in the Genocide Case has triggered significant scholarly critique.¹³⁹ Plücken and Griebel described the ICJ’s use of Nicaragua test as “a misapplication of established rules which is unlikely to find much support” and as “a legal mistake made by the Court, one which it might be difficult to correct in the future”.¹⁴⁰ Shackelford argued that the “Tadić test is better-suited to deal with allegations of genocide than restrictive Nicaragua test”.¹⁴¹ On the other hand, some writers contended differently arguing that the Nicaragua test is the most appropriate test. For example, Rajkovic argued that more expansive attribution test would be “malleable to... extra-legal agendas” and would open door to “politicized jurisprudence,” and that Court’s adherence to Nicaragua sent “a forceful message... that international courts ¹³⁵ *Id.*, at para. §394.\n¹³⁶ *Id.*, The Court further argued that effective control or the instructions given should not be in overall action, rather it should be in accordance with each operation and the alleged violations.\n¹³⁷ *Id.*, at paras. §394, §395. In the view of the Court, there was some evidence, demonstrating that differences over strategic options emerged between Yugoslavian authorities and Bosnian Serb leaders at that time. “The Court therefore finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the Respondent as having been committed by its organs or by persons or entities wholly dependent upon it, and thus do not on this basis entail the Respondent’s international responsibility.”\n¹³⁸ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §403. The ICJ rejected the overall control in two grounds; First, the ICJ argued that ICTY, referring to inquiries of State responsibility, “addressed an issue which was not indispensable for the exercise of its jurisdiction”… “issues of general international law which do not lie within the specific purview of its jurisdiction and, moreover, the resolution of which is not always necessary for deciding the criminal cases before it”. Secondly, *id.*, at paras. §405,406, the ICJ found the ‘overall control’ test ‘unpersuasive.’ The ICJ argued that “logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature” and the ‘overall control’ test overly broadens the scope of State responsibility.\n¹³⁹ See *e.g.* Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105; Abass, supra note 111.\n¹⁴⁰ Plücken &amp; Joern Griebel, supra note 75, at 621.\n¹⁴¹ Shackelford, supra note 3, at 24.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M.

In the opinion of the Court, the relationship did not consist of “complete dependence” and VRS was not “merely [an] instrument” of the FRY.¹⁴⁴ ## 3.4.2. ICTY and “overall control” test The International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (hereinafter ICTY)¹⁴⁵ was looking for an answer for establishing whether or not the armed conflict in the Former Yugoslavia (FRY) region is to be considered as international armed conflict. This was necessary to identify the acts perpetrated by Dusko Tadić¹⁴⁶ after May 19, 1992 whether entailed crimes against “protected persons.”¹⁴⁷ The Tadić Chambers questioned the relationship between the ¹⁴² Nikolas Rajkovic, *On ‘Bad Law’ and ‘Good Politics’: The Politics of the ICJ Genocide Case and Its Interpretation*, LEIDEN J. INT’L L. 21, 885-910 (2008), at pp 885, 896, 900.\n¹⁴³ Talmon at 111. According to Talmon, the Nicaragua judgment established two distinct tests concerning the problem of attribution, the ‘strict control test’ and the ‘effective control test’ respectively.\n¹⁴⁴ ICJ, *Genocide Case*, supra note 82, at para. §392.\n¹⁴⁵ U.N. S.C. Resl. 827, International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (May 25, 1993) [hereinafter ICTY Statute] Article 2: Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n¹⁴⁶ Id., Dusko Tadić was indicted, a citizen of the former Yugoslavia, of Serb ethnic descent, and a resident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of the alleged crimes. “It is the first determination of individual guilt or innocence in connection with serious violations of international humanitarian law by a truly international tribunal.” The Indictment by the Prosecutor against Dusko Tadić, charging him with a total of 132 counts involving grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, and crimes against humanity. The accused was charged with individual counts of persecution, inhuman treatment, cruel treatment, rape, willful killing, murder, torture, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body and health, and inhumane acts alleged to have been committed at the Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje camps and at other locations in Opština Prijedor in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n¹⁴⁷ Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949. Article 4 “[P]ersons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI VRS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The appeal case came after the decision given by the Tadić Trial Chamber on May 1997.¹⁴⁸ The main inquiry of the Appeal Court was the legal criteria for establishing “when, in an armed conflict, which is prima facie internal, private persons may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign power, thereby rendering the conflict into international.”¹⁴⁹ The Court referred to the general international law in order to reach an answer to this problem.¹⁵⁰ are not nationals.” If the FRY had “control” over the VRS (Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska) during the time in question, then the victims would qualify as “protected persons” under the fourth Geneva Convention (In the purview of Article 4 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, being “in the hands of an occupying power of which they were not nationals.”). If it is proven that the State in question is responsible for those acts it necessitates consideration that the State was a party to a conflict deemed to be an international armed conflict. If this categorization fails, Tadić’s victims would not be deemed protected persons, it would automatically imply the existence of a non-international armed conflict. Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions can only possibly happen in the context of an international armed conflict. The Trial Chamber acquitted Tadić on the ground that the victims referred to in the indictment had not been proved to be “protected persons” under the applicable provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Therefore, almost half of the charges against Tadić were considered inapplicable and were terminated by the Trial Chamber- then overruled by the Appeal Chamber.\n¹⁴⁸ ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, at para. §68. This was the first time that the Appeals Chamber decided on an appeal from a final judgment of a Trial Chamber.\n¹⁴⁹ Id., at para. §81. The Appeals Chamber phrased the question as follows: “(i) On what legal conditions armed forces fighting in a prima facie internal armed conflict may be regarded as acting on behalf of a foreign Power and (ii) whether in the instant case the factual conditions which are required by law were satisfied.”\n¹⁵⁰ Id., at para. §97. “Indeed, the legal consequences of the characterization of the conflict as either internal or international are extremely important. Should the conflict eventually be classified as international, it would inter alia follow that a foreign State may in certain circumstances be held responsible for violations of international law perpetrated by the armed groups acting on its behalf.” The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the lawful combatants. According to the Article 4 A (1, 2) of Geneva Convention of 1949, militias or paramilitary groups may be regarded as legitimate combatants if they form “part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict” or “belong to a Party to the conflict.” What logic suggests, “if, in an armed conflict, paramilitary units ‘belong’ to a State other than the one against which they are fighting, the conflict is international and therefore serious violations of the Geneva Conventions may be classified as grave breaches. The Appeals Chamber discussed how to define the notion “belonging to a Party to the conflict.” It is obvious that Article 4 A (1, 2) regulates how to qualify irregulars as lawful combatants. Though the Court admits that belonging to a Party requires ‘a relationship of dependence and allegiance’ of those irregulars to the Party to the conflict, such interpretation also indirectly concerns a test of control. The Appeal Chamber was convinced that the notion of control is necessary to consider what makes an individual or group of individuals, a de facto organ of a foreign State. However, the Court emphasized that what renders an internal armed conflict into an international one, relies on the specification of what degree Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 In the view of the Appeals Chamber, the notion of control is the relevant ‘ingredient’ of the law, where there is the need for international humanitarian law to be supplemented by general international law. The Court found it relevant to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals, governed in general international rules on State responsibility.¹⁵¹ This is because “international humanitarian law does not contain any criteria unique to this body of law for establishing when a group of individuals may be regarded as being under the control of a State, that is, as acting as de facto State officials.”¹⁵² After being convinced that the attribution principles laid down in the law of State responsibility is applicable for the case concerned, the Court examined the very early established test of control, namely ‘effective control’ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The Appeals Chamber read the Nicaragua case as follow: “[The ICJ] essentially set out two tests of State responsibility: (i) responsibility arising out of unlawful acts of State officials; and (ii) responsibility generated by acts performed by private individuals acting as de facto State organs. For State responsibility to arise under (ii), the Court required that private individuals not only be paid or financed by a State, and their action be coordinated or supervised by this State, but also that the State should issue specific instructions concerning the commission of the unlawful acts in question..., the test was not met as far as the contras were concerned: in their case no specific instructions had been issued by the United States concerning the violations of international humanitarian law which they had allegedly perpetrated.”¹⁵³ However, the Appeals Chamber found the ‘effective control’ test unpersuasive. According to the Court, the ‘effective control’ test is not convincing based on two fundamental reasons. First, the Nicaragua test appears “not to be compatible with the logic of the law of State responsibility.”¹⁵⁴ Second, the Nicaragua test seems inconsistent with judicial and State practice.¹⁵⁵ The Nicaragua test, in the Court’s view, appears to be incompatible in accordance with the law of State Responsibility because “the principles of international law concerning the attribution to States of acts performed by of authority or control must be employed by a foreign State over armed forces fighting on its behalf.\n¹⁵¹ Id., at para. §98.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id., at para. §114.\n¹⁵⁴ Id., at paras. §116-123.\n¹⁵⁵ Id., at para. §124-145.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI private individuals are not based on rigid and uniform criteria.\"¹⁵⁶ The acts of private individuals are attributable to States in the instances where the State exercises control over them. Although the Court argued that the effective control test requires a high threshold for the test of control, it admits that\"the degree of control may vary according to the factual circumstances of each case.\"¹⁵⁷ In the situations where a private individual engages some specific illegal acts, it requires to show that the controlling State issued specific instructions for that particular act contrary to international law, which places the individual acting in a de facto capacity. In this respect\"a generic authority over the individual would not be sufficient to engage the international responsibility of the State.\"¹⁵⁸ On the other hand, the Court took the view that an organized group needs a further evaluation. In this respect, the\"overall control\"test newly established by the Chamber, in its view, provides a better understanding equating the organized individuals to the State organ.¹⁵⁹ The Court highlighted that:\"[o]ne should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels. Plainly, an organised group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Normally a member of the group does not act on his own but conforms to the standards prevailing in the group and is subject to the authority of the head of the group. Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State.\"¹⁶⁰ According to the Court, the requisite of control in this case is independent from the requirement of instruction, which is necessary for individuals. Since ¹⁵⁶ *Id.*, at para. §117.\n¹⁵⁷ *Id.* ¹⁵⁸ *Id.*, at paras. §118, §119. The Appeals Chamber pointed out a particular situations where the individuals acts ultra vires. States may assign a private individual with the specific task of performing lawful actions on its behalf. However, if that individual acts beyond the lawful task and breach the international law, in this case, States may also maintain responsibility on this account.\n¹⁵⁹ *Id.*, at para. §121.\n¹⁶⁰ *Id.*, at para. §120.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI the characteristics of an organized group require a broader perspective in which “[the law of] State responsibility is based on a realistic concept of accountability, which disregards legal formalities and aims at ensuring that States entrusting some functions to individuals or groups of individuals must answer for their actions.”¹⁶¹ Then the Appeals Chamber turns to the argument of which the Nicaragua test is at variance with judicial and State practice. The Court argued that the “effective control” test is not the exclusive test and the ICJ failed to maintain convincing evidence that the test is well-suited with international judicial and State practice.¹⁶² In the light of international case law and state practice, the Appeals Chamber looked for an answer for “what measure of State control does international law require for organized military groups?”¹⁶³ In the view of the Appeals Chamber, financial support or even military assistance by a State to an armed group is not sufficient to attribute their acts to that State.¹⁶⁴ “It must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group.”¹⁶⁵ Given that, the issuance of instruction for the operation of particular acts contrary to international law, is not necessary for the purposes of attribution.¹⁶⁶ Finally, the Court emphasized that: “[The requirement for armed groups], does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation. Under international law it is by no means necessary that the controlling authorities should plan all the operations of the units dependent on them, choose their targets, or give specific instructions concerning the conduct of military operations and any alleged violations of international humanitarian law. The control required by international law may be deemed to exist when a State (or, in the context of an armed conflict, the Party to the conflict) has a role in organizing, coordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to ¹⁶¹ Id., at para. §121, 122. “In the case of an organised group, the group normally engages in a series of activities. If it is under the overall control of a State, it must perforce engage the responsibility of that State for its activities, whether or not each of them was specifically imposed, requested or directed by the State.”\n¹⁶² Id., at para. §124.\n¹⁶³ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁴ Id., at para. §130.\n¹⁶⁵ Id., at para. §131.\n¹⁶⁶ Id., at para. §132.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that group. Acts performed by the group or members thereof may be regarded as acts of de facto State organs regardless of any specific instruction by the controlling State concerning the commission of each of those acts.”¹⁶⁷ The Tadić Appeals Chamber Judgment¹⁶⁸ triggered one more time the academic debate regarding the weakening of legal boundaries between two types of armed conflict. The Tadić appeal judgment was the first judicial decision that acknowledged the fundamental change of modern armed conflict regarding with the increasing of internal armed conflicts. The judgment deeply argued the certain distinction and questioned whether the classification was still maintainable where the types of armed conflicts began to multiply.¹⁶⁹ The Appeals Chamber concluded that State practice weakened the traditional idea of rigorous interpretation of types of armed conflicts.¹⁷⁰ According to Cassese, the Chamber did not propound a rigid expression of the required degree of control for any relationship. It could alter according to the circumstances ambient to each relationship. The Chamber relied on judicial and State practice when associating two degrees of control. First, regarding the relationship between private single individuals and a State, acting on behalf of a State, only the acts performed under the instruction of the State can be attributed to that State. In these instances, each action should be treated individually and specific instruction is the fundamental requirement to attribute those actions to a State. This was how the ‘effective control’ test was submitted by the ICJ in Nicaragua.¹⁷¹ However, secondly, there is another degree of control over actions by organized and hierarchically structured groups. In this situation, the Appeals Chamber set out another control test in favor of a flexible approach. There is no need for specific instruction for each individual operation. Such ‘overall control’ includes not only “in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the ¹⁶⁷ Id., at paras. §137, §138. The Court admitted that the ICJ in Nicaragua case had to be carefully examined because “if the controlling State is not the territorial State where the armed clashes occur or where at any rate the armed units perform their acts, more extensive and compelling evidence is required to show that the State is genuinely in control of the units or groups not merely by financing and equipping them, but also by generally directing or helping plan their actions.”\n¹⁶⁸ Id.\n¹⁶⁹ Emily Crawford, *Unequal before the Law: The Case for the Elimination of the Distinction between International and Non-international Armed Conflicts*, LEIDEN J.

Cassese argued that the Appeals Chamber did not preclude the ‘effective control’ test but favored both, which are admissible on different substance and orbit corresponding with judicial and State practice.¹⁷³ ## 3.4.3. Attribution before the European Court of Human Rights The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has jurisdiction to investigate purported breaches of the rights presented in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). From the objective of the convention, in order to establish jurisdiction the conduct at stake should be imputable to a High Contracting Party.¹⁷⁴ The case law of ECtHR, especially the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey¹⁷⁵, Behrami v. France¹⁷⁶, and Bankovic v. Belgium¹⁷⁷ provides insights for such inquiry.¹⁷⁸ ¹⁷² ICTY Appeal Chamber, *Tadić Judgment*, supra note 46, paras §131, §137.\n¹⁷³ Cassese, *The Nicaragua and Tadić Tests Revisited*, supra note 105, at 657.\n¹⁷⁴ The Court has developed “extraterritorial jurisdiction” over persons within the territory that a High Contracting Party exercises legal space (espace juridique) within the scope of Article 1 of the ECHR. For a detailed discussion on the approach taken by ECtHR see Christine Byron, *Blurring of the Boundaries: The Application of International Humanitarian Law by Human Rights Bodies*, VA. J.

Emrah TANYILDIZI # Effective-Overall Control Test ## Loizidou v. Turkey (1996) In the case of Loizidou v Turkey¹⁷⁹, the Court dealt with the facts that a large number of Turkish troops in northern Cyprus were launched on a territory outside of its own designated sovereign area of land. The holding power in the territory was the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the Court did not classify the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey. Rather, in the words of the Court, it is classified as ‘subordinate local administration.’¹⁸⁰ The Court had to determine “whether Turkey was responsible for the continuous denial to the applicant of access to her property in Northern Cyprus. The respondent State, Turkey, denied that the Court had jurisdiction, on the grounds that the act complained of was not committed by one of its authorities but, rather, was attributable to the authorities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).”¹⁸¹ Then the question was whether the conduct commissioned by the authorities of TRNC, consisting of the breach of the ECHR, was attributable to Turkey, which requires the responsibility of Turkey under the auspices of the ECHR.¹⁸² While the Court, seized the issue of jurisdiction, the way it handled the attribution problem was by resorting to the concept of control in order to find an answer to whether Turkey was responsible for the acts of the TRNC authorities. The issue of imputability or attribution was discussed scholarly in depth as being whether the court’s findings was in conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility.¹⁸³ Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI Some scholars argued that the Loizidou case did not deal with attribution of responsibility, but rather with the question of State jurisdiction.¹⁸⁴ Cassese, by contrast, argued that while the Court looked for whether the State’s complaint had jurisdiction over the alleged victims parallel with the question to which State or entity the violations were to be attributed to. This inquiry stipulates which State or entity submitted responsibility for those commissioned violations.¹⁸⁵ That being so, the Court concluded that the restrictions on the right to property complained of by the applicant were attributable to Turkey.¹⁸⁶ “Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, [Turkey’s] responsibility cannot be confined to the act so fits own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support”¹⁸⁷ The Court utilized the notion of ‘effective-overall control’ in a sense aiming to determine the literal power of Turkey outside its national frontiers. It reflects a certain control over a territory and a population that does not belong to it. However, the Court used the effective-overall control test to define to what extent the relationship between Turkey and TRNC adequately fits within the context of the convention.¹⁸⁸ One of the difficulties appears while the Court was seizing a standard for attribution, the court did not resort to the findings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia effective control exercised by Turkey over the territory of Northern Cyprus, attribution of human rights violations see Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at pp. 532-537; see also Frank Hoffmeister, Loizidou v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI (ICTY). Rather the Court advanced its own relevant test by pointing out two distinguishing elements to form its own criteria. First of all, the court appears to read the course of identifying the territorial entity as being a ‘subordinate local administration’¹⁸⁹ by putting leverage on the organizational structure of the entity. Secondly, the entity in question was under the ‘effective authority’ or to a certain extent under the ‘decisive influence’ of outside power.¹⁹⁰ The control over TRNC was defined as being effectively authoritative or at least having a resolute impact on the decision making mechanisms of TRNC. Finally, despite the entity maintaining a certain autonomy, it sustains its existence by the advantage of support, by means of military, financial and political, provided by the outside power.¹⁹¹ The picture delineated by the Court simply excluded the mandate on the commission of the conduct allegedly infringing on the human rights provisions. Rather the Court emphasized the authority on an organizational body which had an indirect influence on the conduct in question. The court did not point out any direction or instruction from the external State on the employment of the act of breach.\n“...It is not necessary to determine whether...Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the “TRNC”. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective overall control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibility for the policies and actions of the “TRNC”. Those affected by such policies or actions therefore come within the “jurisdiction” of Turkey for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (art. 1). Her obligation to secure to the applicant the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention therefore extends to the northern part of Cyprus...”¹⁹² Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory employed directly or through a local authority requires that State’s responsibility. The court did Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI not find it necessary to be evidenced whether Turkey was in actual control of the actions of the\"TRNC\"authorities.¹⁹³ The Court concluded such control from the large number of Turkish troops stationed in Northern Cyprus. This\"obvious\"control necessitated Turkey's responsibility for the policies and actions of the\"TRNC.\"¹⁹⁴ ## Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case (2001) In the Bankovic v Belgium &amp; 16 Others case, The ECHR had to deal with the problem of jurisdiction as it relates to acts of States within their jurisdiction.¹⁹⁵ Such jurisdiction also concerns the acts of State performed abroad by having extraterritorial public authority.¹⁹⁶ Bankovic case was about an application brought in respect of those injured by the bombing of a radio station in Belgrade (a city not located within the territory of a contracting party to the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR]) by the air forces of a number of contracting parties to the convention.¹⁹⁷ In the Bankovic case, although the court investigated 'the legal space of the European Convention,'¹⁹⁸ the law of State responsibility has influenced the reach of human rights obligations.¹⁹⁹ Bankovic case was the first case before ¹⁹³ The test was evidently submitted to a territorial scope. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that the Court advanced the test beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of 'decisive influence' and 'strong support' suffice a control over the local entity in question.\n¹⁹⁴ Oxman &amp; Rudolf, supra note 182, at 534. This approach was also endorsed in the judgment of the Solomou v Turkey case before the ECtHR, referring the Turkish-Cypriot forces as 'agents' of Turkey. Unfortunately, the effective-overall control test does not provide any clear answer for control over the operational activities of the local entity and the level of participation from the external State. The ECtHR promoted to make reference to control over the area rather than directly to control over the officials that had breached Ms. Loizidou's rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) referred to the Loizidou case in the Tadić case, claiming that the effective control test established by the ICJ was not endorsed by judicial and State practice.\n¹⁹⁵ ECHR, Bankovic and Others v.

Emrah TANYILDIZI Human Rights Convention.²¹⁰ The Court, in fact, examined whether it had jurisdiction for the alleged infringements. Then the control over the military contingent did matter, because the entity controlling those persons had to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights in order to raise the responsibility before the convention.²¹¹ The Court applied the ultimate authority and control test to establish whether the UN or France was responsible for the conduct held during the operations. The Court attributed all acts and omissions relating to the operations in Kosovo entirely to the UN, and not its member States.²¹² It did not consider the possibility of the dual or multiple attribution of KFOR's conduct to the UN as well as to NATO and its contributing States (TNCs).²¹³ The court found that the alleged human rights violations were attributable to the United Nations and not to the individual TCNs, and therefore the Court was not competent ratione personae to examine the relevant actions.²¹⁴ Finally, the Court concluded that the UN had an operational command that was evidence for ultimate authority and control over the military contingents during the operations, so that it did not have jurisdiction.²¹⁵ ²¹⁰ Id., at para §144.\n²¹¹ Id., at paras. §133, §144: The Court relied on the 1244 Security Council Resolution.

Emrah TANYILDIZI ## 4. Framing Attribution in the Context of Cyberattacks It appears that present attribution tests and their relevant interpretations, consist of a normatively inconsistent character that increases the risk of international law to become fragmented. In order to avoid such an outcome, I formulate, without any substantial modification, the principles of attribution in terms of two main classes of attribution models, *de facto* organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). The aim is to establish a categorical framework for validating legally consistent attribution standards that are also applicable to cyber attacks.\nIn regard to the contradiction between the interpretation of control tests and the abstract nature of attribution models, de facto organ theory and control theory differ, but they fall within the same conceptual area. While the latter requires proof of control, the former requires a de facto relationship. This distinction may not be problematic in cases where the concept of State responsibility transforms from a subjective context to an objective one.²¹⁶ The analytical distinction between de facto organ theory and control theory is apparent, however, whether or not the relationship of non-state actors to a State depends on equating, for legal purposes, the non-state actors with an organ of the State or identifying them as agents working on behalf of the state.²¹⁷ Thus de facto organ theory requires complete dependence, issuance of instruction and direction for each specific operation, while control theory requires an autonomous concept of control and a continuous factual link between the State and a group of individuals.\n## 4.1. De facto organ theory (Agency-based Attribution) ### 4.1.1. Defining de facto affairs The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case defined de facto organ theory. In that case, the ICJ distinguished two classes of individuals who lacked de jure State organ status but nevertheless acted on behalf of the State.²¹⁸ Members of one military group that was dependent on the United States for financing, equipment, planning, and direction were categorized as “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” (UCLAS). A second group, the *contras*, that was also financed and equipped by the United States, however, was found to retain a degree of independence.²¹⁹ Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI The ICJ ruled that the acts of those categorized as UCLAS were attributable to the United States because they were paid by and acting on the direct instruction of U.S. military or intelligence personnel.²²⁰ The ICJ did not, however, make the same judgment in relation to link between the United States and the contras, whom it did not find to be a de facto organ. The Court held that, even though they were financed, aided and supported in several ways by the United States, the contras were not a pure creation of the United States because their relationship with it was not one of “complete dependence.” The Court further found that the United States did not exercise “effective control” over the contras.²²¹ De facto organ theory proposes equating private actors with de jure organs of States. This link is not a legal abstraction, but a positive determination that a non-state actor is dependent on and under the control of a specific State organ.²²² Although the distinction between de jure and de facto organs is based on a factual link and the nature of a State function, de facto organ status means acting “on behalf” of the State, a notion that has unlimited potential applications.²²³ According to this theory, the organs of a State supplement their own action with the help of private persons who act as “auxiliaries” while remaining outside the State’s official apparatus.²²⁴ Clearly, States delegate to private persons those tasks that they do not want to carry out directly.²²⁵ The Nicaragua judgment is significant from the perspective of de facto organ theory for two reasons. First, there exists a de facto link between the State and private persons.²²⁶ In the Nicaragua case, the United States participated in the financing, organization, training, supply, and equipping of the contras, as well as selection of military targets and planning of entire operations.²²⁷ The second requirement is that private persons be in a condition of “complete dependence” on the State, or that the State have “effective control” over those persons in regard to the acts that the State allegedly ordered them to execute.²²⁸ According to De Frouville, the second requirement, the finding of a simple factual link, can be seen as the consequence of a subjective conception of responsibility according to which the “fault” remains the requirement Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI for responsibility. The theory establishes the parameter that the act must proceed from the free will of the State.²²⁹ The requirement of “effective control” indicates a strict understanding that the State desires the outcome of the private conduct. Objective factual attachment is not sufficient to establish attribution, and further investigation is necessary to reveal the State’s aims.²³⁰ Although this strict interpretation of de facto organ theory of attribution remains to be applied by the ICJ in its more recent ruling of the 2007 Genocide case, it appears that the ICJ modified its approach by distinguishing between a de facto organ and a private person acting under the effective control or instructions of the State.²³¹ This new approach is unconvincing because it conflicts with the established criteria in the Nicaragua case.²³² Another example of the distinction between de facto and de jure is the aforementioned Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights. This case involved a breach of the property rights of a Greek Cypriot applicant²³³ who could not access her property because of Turkish control of the northern part of Cyprus.²³⁴ It is unclear whether the European Court considered classifying the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as a de facto organ of Turkey in accordance with Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC since it defined the former as a “subordinate local administration.”²³⁵ ## 4.1.2. Specifics of de facto organ theory De facto organ theory includes specific notions of “complete dependence,” “issuance”, and “operating at specific capacity.”\n### Complete dependence The ICJ formulated the attribution in the Nicaragua case using an incorporated concept of dependency and control.²³⁶ According to the Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI Nicaragua formulation, control is a byproduct of dependence or, put another way, dependence generates the potential for control.²³⁷ In the words of Talmon, “Dependence and control are thus two sides of the same coin”;²³⁸ the Court made the question of responsibility one of “degree,” namely the “degree of dependency” on the intervening State. Complete dependence, then, creates a “degree of potential control” of the intervening State over the non-state actor.²³⁹ Beyond the discussion of whether the Nicaragua formulation advocates one or more tests of attribution, de facto organ theory embraces the concepts of dependence and control, contending that both encourage a legal understanding of the non-state actor as a State organ, so that the acts of non-state actors are at the same time viewed as those of a State.\nComplete dependence is assessed according to three strict criteria. First, the non-state actor must have absolute dependence on the intervening State. Second, this dependence must extend to all of the activities of the non-state actor. Finally, the intervening State must possess a high degree of control over the non-state actor. A non-state actor who meets these three requirements can be viewed as a de facto organ of the intervening State.²⁴⁰ ## Operating at specific capacity (issuance of direction) De facto organ theory encompasses another “exacting test” beside the complete dependence test that applies in instances in which specific instructions must be given by the intervening State concerning each action taken by the non-state actor.²⁴¹ De facto organ theory only applies when individuals act in a specific capacity on behalf of a State.²⁴² Thus, for example, the “effective control” test in the Nicaragua case required evidence that the United States had directed the contras to perform specific operations (e.g., the indiscriminate killing of civilians) on its behalf.²⁴³ In this respect, the question is no longer one of dependence, but rather of the specificity of operation.²⁴⁴ Although non-state actors are to a certain extent independent of the intervening State, their conduct occurs under the authority of de jure organs of that State. Under these circumstances, the Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI objectives of non-state actors and an intervening State regarding a particular operation that involves an internationally wrongful act are complementary rather than distinct. Consequently, the function of de facto organ theory is to decide whether a person or group of persons qualifies as a de facto organ of a State; the focus is on particular operations on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, de facto organ theory prioritizes instruction and dependence over control.\nIn the context of cyberspace, identifying the online actors remains complicated. It is highly difficult for skilled cyber attacker to be positively identified.²⁴⁵ It may appear as “information-warfare militia unit, but at the same time, being a university IT department, an online advertising agency, an online gaming clan, a patriot-hacker team, and a local cyber-crime syndicate engaged in software piracy”.²⁴⁶ Although the type of any domestic legal status or lack of it has no effect on attribution, however, as for example of the Stuxnet case, it shifted from financial motivations for the conduct of cyber attacks toward the aim of disrupting critical infrastructure on overseas.²⁴⁷ This brings attention of those perpetrators’ identity where cyber attacks have become an instrument in States’ attempts to gain political, economic and military advantages, for which reason States will probably continue to sponsor them. According to de facto organ theory, complete dependence is the first resort to look into if any factual link materializes equating private cyberattackers with de jure organ of sponsoring State.²⁴⁸ The inquiry starts with whether the cyberattackers are pure creation of the sponsoring State, whether those perpetrators are dependent on the sponsoring State for ‘financing, equipment, planning and direction’, whether their existence is conditional on the sponsoring State’s involvement, organization, training, supply, selection of tagets and planning of entire operations. As in the affirmative, these cyberattackers will be considered de facto organ of that State.²⁴⁹ However, in the instances where cyberattackers retain a degree of independence in which they act as ‘auxiliaries’ remaining outside the State’s Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI official apparatus, the sponsoring State exercises command and control in relation to a particular operation.²⁵⁰ As a consequence of subjective conception of responsibility, the degree of control shall be stated as high as the wrongful act must proceed form the free will of the State, where apparently that State desires the outcome of the cyberattack.²⁵¹ This creates a specific link between the sponsoring State and the perpetrators that the latter acts as de facto in actual State function, subordinated and delegated with issuance of operation in which acting on behalf of that State. In this case, if a State specifically instructed private actors to conduct cyberattack against a selected objective, the outcome of operation would be attributable to the State in question.²⁵² In the light of de facto organ theory; incitement, ‘rallying call’, alignment of goals, encouragement for the action, or shared goals would not be sufficient to conclude that the conduct is attributable to the sponsoring State.²⁵³ The instructions must be given specifically “in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred”.²⁵⁴ For example, in the Estonian case, one may argue that Russia politically had shared goals with the perpetrators and plausibly instigated or encouraged the latter to attack Estonian networks, however, it was not enough for the aforementioned formation of the legal attribution.²⁵⁵ ## 4.2. Control theory (Control-based Attribution) ## 4.2.1. Defining the control affair When a State outsources tasks to private actors, it needs to retain control over them. The conduct of the latter, however, would not immediately be the State’s responsibility, since it can only be held responsible for allowing a non- Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI state actor to exercise the desired functions.²⁵⁶ In this respect, the scope and degree of control play a pivotal role in defining the relationship between the non-state actor and the State.\nAs previously discussed, the Loizidou v. Turkey case establishes an analytical distinction between the de facto and de jure status of State organs and private persons. It thus appears that the European Court does not regard the TRNC as a de facto organ of Turkey.²⁵⁷ To review briefly, it is not clear whether the Court’s categorization falls under Articles 4 or 8 of the ILC, since the court defined the TRNC as a “subordinate local administration.”²⁵⁸ The Court did argue that the large number of its troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus meant that the Turkish army exercised effective control over that part of the island. This degree of control would make Turkey responsible for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁵⁹ Thus De Frouville has argued that the notion of effective overall control “allows one to establish that all acts committed by its organs de jure or de facto on this territory are attributable to Turkey... thus expresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibility of State Parties to the Convention. But it has nothing to do with the definition of a de facto organ.”²⁶⁰ In the Tadić case, the ICTY employed principles of State responsibility to determine whether the conduct of individuals is attributable to a State and its participation in the conflict. The Court accordingly examined individuals, their conduct, and the participation of an outside State.²⁶¹ The Tadić decision is convincing in the sense that it did not reject the application of an effective control test entirely.²⁶² Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI ## 4.2.2. Specifics of control theory ### The Concept of Control While de facto organ theory focuses on the degree of dependence and specific instructions, control theory addresses the question of conduct, control and its continuity.²⁶³ The ICTY, in the Tadić case defined control as playing a significant role “not only in equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military or paramilitary activity.”²⁶⁴ There is no need for specific instructions for each operation; the State’s overall control over the group is sufficient.²⁶⁵ The test also submits a territorial dimension. However, the elements allocated above demonstrates that control go beyond a territorial consideration by putting leverage on the issues of ‘decisive influence’ and ‘strong support’ that suffice a certain degree of control over the non-state entity in question.²⁶⁶ Cassese has described this as “control of a global nature.”²⁶⁷ Control takes a different form in the context of a hierarchically structured group. Again, States cannot be expected to exercise absolute control over each member of an organized armed group. This fact inherently weakens the link between the group members and the State. However, the State’s systematic and broad support of the group indicates strong influence over the planning or organization of the group’s activities.²⁶⁸ A specific order or command is not required for this kind of relationship. The global authority of the State over the group suffices to confer responsibility on the former when the latter breaks international law.²⁶⁹ Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI The Appeals Chamber found that the relationship between VRS and FRY was sufficient to conclude that FRY played a role in the armed conflict by coordinating or helping to plan the military activities of the VRS. This global control was sufficient to assert that FRY could be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of the group.²⁷⁰ Unlike the effective control test, specific instruction was not a requirement. The Court allowed interplay between the distinctions between individual and organized groups, using the control concept as an independent model. This approach also has its foundations in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The ILC forges a compromise by allowing “control” to serve as an autonomous criterion, or an alternative, in regard to other two notions, namely instruction and direction.²⁷¹ A further justification for the distinction between individuals and groups is the existence of a factual link, whether temporary or continuous, between the State and the private person.²⁷² Thus, while the de facto theory supposes a temporary factual link between the foreign State and individual, the control theory, by contrast, assumes ‘decisive influence’, ‘strong support’ and a continuous factual link between the State and the organized group.²⁷³ ## Attribution in extra-territorial context Territorial scope plays a significant role in the application of control theory. In the Tadić example, the State in question had weakened authority over the territory in which armed clashes occurred.²⁷⁴ The neighboring controlling State had territorial ambitions regarding the State in which the conflict was taking place. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the controlling State was attempting to enlarge its territory through armed forces that it controlled.²⁷⁵ Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI In Celebici case, the ICTY Appeals Chamber also emphasized this territorial context. The Court argued, as in the Tadić case, that the controlling State had territorial ambitions on another State in which the conflict was taking place and was using armed forces to achieve its ends.²⁷⁶ Although the armed groups had “autonomous choices of means and tactics” while acting on behalf of the controlling State, the goal of territorial enlargement demonstrated that both shared a common strategy.²⁷⁷ These cases demonstrate that territory is a key dimension of the control theory in which the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature.\nThe Loizidou v. Turkey²⁷⁸ case before the European Court of Human Rights can again serve as an instructive example. The Court dealt with the fact that many Turkish troops were stationed beyond their national borders in northern Cyprus.²⁷⁹ The Court used the relationship between the Turkish military and the TRNC authorities as a major parameter for establishing the attribution test that it termed “effective overall control.” In the words of the Court, ‘the Turkish Military had effective overall control over northern Cyprus,’ that creates a subordinate relationship with ‘strong support’ and ‘decisive influence’.²⁸⁰ The Court thus, by addressing the issue of territory in the context of the control standard, established that such control necessarily entails Turkey’s responsibility for the policies and actions of the TRNC.²⁸¹ In the context of cyberattacks, control theory suggests that the analytical distinction between de facto and de jure organs of sponsoring State may be excluded in the instances where the relationship between that State and the non-state actors has a continuous and auxiliary nature. Classification of individuals is not needed where the relationship served in extraterritorial and chain of command context. ‘Continuation of instruction’ creates a certain degree of control that reaches out a particular relationship of ‘suggestion or innuendo’ between the non-state actor and the sponsoring State that may ²⁷⁶ Prosecutor v.

This test does not attempt to define the existence of a de facto organ, but instead stresses the extraterritorial dimension of the responsibilities of State parties to the European Convention. From the point of view of the Court, the external State need not “actually exercise... detailed control over the policies and actions” of the authorities of the territorial entity in order to attribute the acts of the TRNC to Turkey. Concerning the question of attribution, the Court held that effective control over an area outside a State’s national territory, whether employed directly or through a local authority, necessarily implies that State’s responsibility.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI also trigger the responsibility of the latter.²⁸² The subordinate relationship of this kind between the sponsoring State and the leadership of a group of individuals structured hierarchically suffice ‘control of a global nature’.²⁸³ Although the evidences in the Stuxnet worm case was not sufficient to come to a swift conclusion, the alleged U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges appears to be advanced and destructive.²⁸⁴ Many experts have referred this attack as very likely a State-sponsored cyberattack.²⁸⁵ It was reported that the virus “created in a modular fashion-programmed in ‘chunks’ by teams that probably had no idea of the larger project”.²⁸⁶ While the alleged sponsoring States played host to attackers, planned, organized, coordinated the attack; however, the leadership of non-state actor and its chain of command, and the ongoing relationship of subordination remains to be officially evidenced. This is because the online orbit occupied by ‘loosely structured entities’.²⁸⁷ ## 5. Conclusion According to the proposed categorization, de facto organ theory has specific requirements regarding instruction, direction, and complete dependence, while the requirements of control theory focus on continuity of the relationship and the degree of control in an organizational and extra-territorial context. The normative differences between these two models of attribution do not produce a fragmented system, but rather contribute to the notion of unity in international law. Furthermore, de facto organ theory relates to questions of dependence and instruction, and control theory to questions of conduct and its continuation. A seemingly fanciful but in fact normative distinction between these two theoretical perspectives thus may have the potential to provide answers regarding the allocation of responsibility between States and non-state actors in cyberspace.\nSignificant in this regard is the distinction between individuals and groups where different standards of attribution are concerned. Attributable cyber activities often involve private individuals receiving specific instructions from the intervening State for each operation that they carry out on that State’s behalf. Other conditions obtain in the case of an organized group that has Law &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI a chain of command, a set of rules, and outward symbols of authority.²⁸⁸ Members of an organized group naturally rely on the rules of the group and the orders of the commander rather than acting on their own. It is insufficient and impractical to demand that a State issue specific instructions to individual members of a group before making a determination of attribution. Thus in the Tadić case, the Court concluded that the group as a whole was under the overall control of the intervening State.²⁸⁹ In cases where cyber activities involve organized groups, material proof relies on the conduct of individual group members, apart from that which is self-motivated.\nAccording to de facto organ theory, attribution requires that specific instructions have been issued to individuals regarding each cyber activity by the sponsoring State, unless complete dependency on the intervening or instructing State is evidenced.²⁹⁰ This is the case in instances where individuals perform cyber activities on behalf of a State.²⁹¹ As a result, the status of individuals comes to play a crucial role in regard to determining whether they may be considered a de facto organ of that State.\nOn the other hand, in cases involving organized and hierarchically structured groups, such as cyber units, the degree of control over conduct is a sufficient indication of attributability, and specific instructions are not required for each individual operation.²⁹² Such control resides not only in “equipping, financing or training and providing operational support to the group, but also in coordinating or helping in the general planning of its [attack].”²⁹³ This is the case when one State sponsors a group of individuals to conduct cyber attacks against another State by coordinating or otherwise helping in the general planning of the group’s activities.\nWhile control theory focuses on the conduct, its continuity and the degree of control, then, de facto organ theory makes the legal status of individuals the central issue by examining their dependency on the instructing State.²⁹⁴ The use of organized groups creates the problems of complicity with a command of chain and identification of the exact perpetrator of the wrongful conduct. It is therefore crucial to determine whether this conduct was committed directly or rather was controlled by entities other than the agents on the ground.\nLaw &amp; Justice Review, Year:8, Issue:14, June 2017 STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN CYBERSPACE: THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION OF CYBERATTACKS CONDUCTED BY NON-STATE ACTORS Dr. M. Emrah TANYILDIZI A strict interpretation of attribution could result in the potential to produce undesirable outcomes. Since no single authority controls cyberspace, sponsoring States are free to attempt to enlarge their capacities in this new international arena by launching cyber actions against other States. The lack of such flexibility in attribution models may enable States to evade responsibility for serious breaches of international law. Their illegal conduct has become more sophisticated because of the special role of non-state actors in cyber conflicts. States may try to avoid responsibility by acting through non-state actors and then contending that these agents are not classifiable as State organs under given international and domestic laws.²⁹⁵ If the evidentiary standard is set high in this regard, States can simply escape accountability.\nI argue that the doctrine of attribution has the potential to provide legally adequate mechanisms for strengthening international standards of accountability and responsibility for unlawful cyber activities. From this perspective, maximization of accountability is necessary for international peace and security. A categorization of systematic models, without any fundamental change in the law of attribution, can increase the utility of the relevant standards for today's needs. It remains up to individual States to decide whether they will adopt the lower standards of proof in order better to hold State promoters of cyber attacks accountable in the present and to discourage sponsorship of international cyber crime in the future.²⁹⁶"

    "abstract": "This paper assesses the effectiveness of international law in ensuring the responsibility of states for the cyber activities of non-state actors. In particular, it addresses the most critical international legal question of whether states can be held responsible for wrongful acts committed by non-state actors in or through cyberspace. The aim is to identify and apply the law of international responsibility and attribution models in order to help make the cyber world safer for all. This paper introduces a categorical analysis for the attribution of private conduct to a state by formulating attribution models in two main settings, de facto organ theory (agency-based attribution) and control theory (control-based attribution). This categorization offers a theoretical framework with which to validate legally consistent and practically applicable models of attribution. Both attribution theories characterize the legality of a state operation that is seemingly private conduct and transform the conduct of a physical person or entity into an “act of state.” This paper highlights the current models in the doctrine of attribution that correspond to the International Law Commission’s (ILC) articles and international case law concerning the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts.",
