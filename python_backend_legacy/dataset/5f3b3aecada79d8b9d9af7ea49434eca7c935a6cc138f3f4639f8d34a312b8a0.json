The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\n\nReceived 21 December 2018\n\nRevised 24 April 2019\n\nAccepted 4 May 2019\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nSaudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations\n\n## Introduction\n\nConfidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent\n\nCONTACT James Shires\n\\odot\n James_shires@hks.harvard.edu\n\n© 2019 Chatham House",

This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\n\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\n\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations\n\nHack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\n\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to",

            "markdown": "execute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\n\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure (Pozen 2013). This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively (Walzer 2018). In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label (Tilly 2004; Jackson et al. 2011), so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\n\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it:",

(Fisher 2015)”\n\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\n\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity (Shires 2018), even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi (Cellan-Jones 2018). This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts (Kenyon 2018), meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\n\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak (Willsher and Henley 2017). The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.",

            "markdown": "2. HLOs in international politics\n\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n\n### Data breaches\n\nHLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders (Verizon 2018). For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations (Infowatch 2017, 2018). Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\n\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\n\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n\n###",

            "markdown": "Cyber-enabled information operations\n\nMany cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia (Raska 2018).\n\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes' (Kerr and Lin 2017, 4). Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media' (Omand 2018, 8). In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers' (Mansted 2018, 9).\n\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society (Hulcoop et al. 2017). As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n\n### Hack-and-leak operations\n\nThere have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number",

            "markdown": "in the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\n\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially (Arthur 2013). There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\n\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation",

In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\n\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths (Checkel 2008). This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring (Shires 2019a), this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n\n### The Yemen cyber Army\n\nThe Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum) (Al-Arabiya 2015). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n\n### MFA operation\n\nOn 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of",

The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically (Vocativ 2015). The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012 (Bronk and Tikk-Ringas 2013). The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n\n### Contested attribution\n\nMany observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location' (Frenkel 2015). Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident (Ragan 2015).\n\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed",

However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n\n### Wikileaks release\n\nOn 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access (WikiLeaks 2015). WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n\n### Response to WikiLeaks\n\nThe Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security' (Reuters 2015a). The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)' (CNN 2015). The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later (Sasapost 2015). The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017 (Al-Sharif 2017). It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\n\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing",

Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?' (Sasapost 2015). However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity (Jones 2016, 2017), it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n\n### Wider impact\n\nAfter this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012 (Reuters 2015b; Hubbard and Sheikh 2017), and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia (Atiaf 2015; Rabwah Times 2015; Zalat and Hamama 2015).Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria (Hoff 2016) and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Al-Hurra 2015; Bushehri 2015; Iraqi Thoughts 2015; OTV 2015; TOLOnews 2015). Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia (Bahgat 2015; Dorling 2015; Makuch and Ling 2015; RSF 2015).Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia (Bowcott 2015; Neuer 2015).Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks (Michael 2015).\n\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad (Hegghammer 2011; Al-Rasheed 2013), its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes (Sakr 2002; Lynch 2007), and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring (Lynch 2013; Matthiesen 2013), as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism (Legrenzi 2015). The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013.

However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs\n\nThe impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\n\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\n\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records ... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity' (Kwoka 2015, 1401). Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr (Ajami 2015). In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of",

Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\n\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\n\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\n\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia (Rid 2016). However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements (Rugh 2010). The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later (Jilani and Grim 2017).",

The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\n\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures",

For overview and critique, see Shires and Smeets (2017), Futter (2018) and Shires (2019b).The distinction between intrusion and interference relies on the execution of code on the target system. This diverges from Waldo et al.'s view of cyberattacks as gaining a ‘thread of control' by differentiating more strongly between denial of service attacks and other kinds (Waldo et al. 2018).However, examples of significant cyber incidents involving only interference are the Estonia ‘cyberwar' in 2007, the denial of service attacks known as Op Ababil, attributed to Iran, in 2012, and the Mirai botnet in 2016.Also, practices of classification are changing in tandem with technological developments (Smeets 2017; Swire 2015; Aldrich and Moran 2018).Available at http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks.Presentation by Camille Francois of Graphika at CyberWarCon, Washington DC, November 2018.Available at https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.I thank J.D.

Due to the focus of this article and the skillset of the author, this list may unintentionally exclude hack-and-leak operations in world regions that are not the US, Europe or the Middle East, and I would be grateful for additional information to expand and improve this list. Attribution is a direct quotation from the source listed and has not been independently verified. The cut-off date is 22 May 2019. The date for each incident lists the date of first leak, if available, and date of first media report if not. Some incidents include multiple leaks over a sustained period of time (up to a year); this aspect is not captured in Figure 1 or the following table:  $N = 47$ .\n\nTable A1.

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 21 December 2018\nRevised 24 April 2019\nAccepted 4 May 2019\n## KEYWORDS\nSaudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations\n## Introduction\nConfidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent\nCONTACT James Shires\n\\odot\n James_shires@hks.harvard.edu\n© 2019 Chatham House\ninvestigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations\nHack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to\nexecute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure (Pozen 2013). This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively (Walzer 2018). In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label (Tilly 2004; Jackson et al. 2011), so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it:\nIt was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter. (Fisher 2015)”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity (Shires 2018), even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi (Cellan-Jones 2018). This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts (Kenyon 2018), meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak (Willsher and Henley 2017). The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n2. HLOs in international politics\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches\nHLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders (Verizon 2018). For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations (Infowatch 2017, 2018). Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n###\nCyber-enabled information operations\nMany cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia (Raska 2018).\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes' (Kerr and Lin 2017, 4). Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media' (Omand 2018, 8). In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers' (Mansted 2018, 9).\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society (Hulcoop et al. 2017). As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations\nThere have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number\nin the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially (Arthur 2013). There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation\n-- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths (Checkel 2008). This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring (Shires 2019a), this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets.

I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army\nThe Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum) (Al-Arabiya 2015). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation\nOn 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of\nForeign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically (Vocativ 2015). The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012 (Bronk and Tikk-Ringas 2013). The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution\nMany observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location' (Frenkel 2015). Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident (Ragan 2015).\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed\n(Lindsay 2015; Rid and Buchanan 2015). However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release\nOn 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access (WikiLeaks 2015). WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks\nThe Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security' (Reuters 2015a). The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)' (CNN 2015). The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later (Sasapost 2015). The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017 (Al-Sharif 2017). It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing\nin them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?' (Sasapost 2015). However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity (Jones 2016, 2017), it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact\nAfter this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012 (Reuters 2015b; Hubbard and Sheikh 2017), and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia (Atiaf 2015; Rabwah Times 2015; Zalat and Hamama 2015).Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria (Hoff 2016) and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Al-Hurra 2015; Bushehri 2015; Iraqi Thoughts 2015; OTV 2015; TOLOnews 2015). Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia (Bahgat 2015; Dorling 2015; Makuch and Ling 2015; RSF 2015).Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia (Bowcott 2015; Neuer 2015).Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks (Michael 2015).\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad (Hegghammer 2011; Al-Rasheed 2013), its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes (Sakr 2002; Lynch 2007), and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring (Lynch 2013; Matthiesen 2013), as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism (Legrenzi 2015). The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up\ndedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs\nThe impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records ... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity' (Kwoka 2015, 1401). Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr (Ajami 2015). In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of\nrecipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia (Rid 2016). However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements (Rugh 2010). The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later (Jilani and Grim 2017).\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion\nThis article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures\nto mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms.",

I thank the participants for their comments; all errors are mine.All details in this paragraph taken from Lipton, Sanger, and Shane (2016).This paragraph is a synthesis of an extensive debate on how best to characterise cyber operations in International Relations (IR). For overview and critique, see Shires and Smeets (2017), Futter (2018) and Shires (2019b).The distinction between intrusion and interference relies on the execution of code on the target system. This diverges from Waldo et al.'s view of cyberattacks as gaining a ‘thread of control' by differentiating more strongly between denial of service attacks and other kinds (Waldo et al. 2018).However, examples of significant cyber incidents involving only interference are the Estonia ‘cyberwar' in 2007, the denial of service attacks known as Op Ababil, attributed to Iran, in 2012, and the Mirai botnet in 2016.Also, practices of classification are changing in tandem with technological developments (Smeets 2017; Swire 2015; Aldrich and Moran 2018).Available at http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks.Presentation by Camille Francois of Graphika at CyberWarCon, Washington DC, November 2018.Available at https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations.I thank J.D.

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 21 December 2018 Revised 24 April 2019 Accepted 4 May 2019 ## KEYWORDS Saudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations ## Introduction Confidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent CONTACT James Shires \\odot James_shires@hks.harvard.edu © 2019 Chatham House investigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations Hack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to execute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure. This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively. In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label, so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it: It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter.”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity, even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi. This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts, meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak. The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches HLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders. For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations. Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n### Cyber-enabled information operations Many cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia.\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes'. Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media'. In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers'.\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society. As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations There have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number in the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially. There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation -- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths. This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring, this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army The Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation On 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically. The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012. The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution Many observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location'. Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident.\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed. However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release On 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access. WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks The Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security'. The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)'. The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later. The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017. It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing in them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?'. However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity, it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact After this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012, and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia.Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon. Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia.Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia.Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks.\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad, its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes, and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring, as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism. The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up dedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs The impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity'. Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr. In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of recipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia. However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements. The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later.\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion This article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures to mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms.",

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 21 December 2018 Revised 24 April 2019 Accepted 4 May 2019 ## KEYWORDS Saudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations ## Introduction Confidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent CONTACT James Shires \\odot James_shires@hks.harvard.edu © 2019 Chatham House investigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations Hack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to execute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure. This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively. In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label, so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it: It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter.”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity, even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi. This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts, meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak. The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches HLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders. For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations. Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n### Cyber-enabled information operations Many cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia.\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes'. Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media'. In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers'.\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society. As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations There have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number in the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially. There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation -- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths. This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring, this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army The Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation On 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically. The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012. The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution Many observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location'. Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident.\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed. However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release On 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access. WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks The Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security'. The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)'. The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later. The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017. It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing in them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?'. However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity, it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact After this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012, and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia.Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon. Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia.Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia.Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks.\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad, its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes, and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring, as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism. The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up dedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs The impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity'. Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr. In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of recipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia. However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements. The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later.\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion This article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures to mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms.",

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 21 December 2018\nRevised 24 April 2019\nAccepted 4 May 2019\n## KEYWORDS\nSaudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations\n## Introduction\nConfidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent\nCONTACT James Shires\n\\odot\n James_shires@hks.harvard.edu\n© 2019 Chatham House\ninvestigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations\nHack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to\nexecute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure (Pozen 2013). This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively (Walzer 2018). In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label (Tilly 2004; Jackson et al. 2011), so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it:\nIt was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter. (Fisher 2015)”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity (Shires 2018), even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi (Cellan-Jones 2018). This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts (Kenyon 2018), meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak (Willsher and Henley 2017). The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n2. HLOs in international politics\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches\nHLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders (Verizon 2018). For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations (Infowatch 2017, 2018). Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n###\nCyber-enabled information operations\nMany cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia (Raska 2018).\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes' (Kerr and Lin 2017, 4). Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media' (Omand 2018, 8). In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers' (Mansted 2018, 9).\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society (Hulcoop et al. 2017). As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations\nThere have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number\nin the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially (Arthur 2013). There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation\n-- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths (Checkel 2008). This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring (Shires 2019a), this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army\nThe Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum) (Al-Arabiya 2015). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation\nOn 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of\nForeign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically (Vocativ 2015). The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012 (Bronk and Tikk-Ringas 2013). The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution\nMany observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location' (Frenkel 2015). Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident (Ragan 2015).\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed\n(Lindsay 2015; Rid and Buchanan 2015). However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release\nOn 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access (WikiLeaks 2015). WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks\nThe Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security' (Reuters 2015a). The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)' (CNN 2015). The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later (Sasapost 2015). The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017 (Al-Sharif 2017). It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing\nin them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?' (Sasapost 2015). However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity (Jones 2016, 2017), it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact\nAfter this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012 (Reuters 2015b; Hubbard and Sheikh 2017), and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia (Atiaf 2015; Rabwah Times 2015; Zalat and Hamama 2015).Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria (Hoff 2016) and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Al-Hurra 2015; Bushehri 2015; Iraqi Thoughts 2015; OTV 2015; TOLOnews 2015). Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia (Bahgat 2015; Dorling 2015; Makuch and Ling 2015; RSF 2015).Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia (Bowcott 2015; Neuer 2015).Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks (Michael 2015).\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad (Hegghammer 2011; Al-Rasheed 2013), its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes (Sakr 2002; Lynch 2007), and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring (Lynch 2013; Matthiesen 2013), as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism (Legrenzi 2015). The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up\ndedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs\nThe impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records ... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity' (Kwoka 2015, 1401). Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr (Ajami 2015). In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of\nrecipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia (Rid 2016). However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements (Rugh 2010). The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later (Jilani and Grim 2017).\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion\nThis article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures\nto mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms."

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 21 December 2018\nRevised 24 April 2019\nAccepted 4 May 2019\n## KEYWORDS\nSaudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations\n## Introduction\nConfidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent\nCONTACT James Shires\n\\odot\n James_shires@hks.harvard.edu\n© 2019 Chatham House\ninvestigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations\nHack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to\nexecute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure (Pozen 2013). This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively (Walzer 2018). In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label (Tilly 2004; Jackson et al. 2011), so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it:\nIt was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter. (Fisher 2015)”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity (Shires 2018), even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi (Cellan-Jones 2018). This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts (Kenyon 2018), meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak (Willsher and Henley 2017). The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n2. HLOs in international politics\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches\nHLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders (Verizon 2018). For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations (Infowatch 2017, 2018). Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n###\nCyber-enabled information operations\nMany cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia (Raska 2018).\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes' (Kerr and Lin 2017, 4). Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media' (Omand 2018, 8). In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers' (Mansted 2018, 9).\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society (Hulcoop et al. 2017). As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations\nThere have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number\nin the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially (Arthur 2013). There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation\n-- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths (Checkel 2008). This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring (Shires 2019a), this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army\nThe Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum) (Al-Arabiya 2015). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation\nOn 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of\nForeign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically (Vocativ 2015). The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012 (Bronk and Tikk-Ringas 2013). The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution\nMany observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location' (Frenkel 2015). Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident (Ragan 2015).\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed\n(Lindsay 2015; Rid and Buchanan 2015). However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release\nOn 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access (WikiLeaks 2015). WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks\nThe Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security' (Reuters 2015a). The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)' (CNN 2015). The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later (Sasapost 2015). The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017 (Al-Sharif 2017). It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing\nin them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?' (Sasapost 2015). However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity (Jones 2016, 2017), it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact\nAfter this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012 (Reuters 2015b; Hubbard and Sheikh 2017), and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia (Atiaf 2015; Rabwah Times 2015; Zalat and Hamama 2015).Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria (Hoff 2016) and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Al-Hurra 2015; Bushehri 2015; Iraqi Thoughts 2015; OTV 2015; TOLOnews 2015). Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia (Bahgat 2015; Dorling 2015; Makuch and Ling 2015; RSF 2015).Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia (Bowcott 2015; Neuer 2015).Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks (Michael 2015).\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad (Hegghammer 2011; Al-Rasheed 2013), its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes (Sakr 2002; Lynch 2007), and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring (Lynch 2013; Matthiesen 2013), as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism (Legrenzi 2015). The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up\ndedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs\nThe impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records ... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity' (Kwoka 2015, 1401). Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr (Ajami 2015). In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of\nrecipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia (Rid 2016). However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements (Rugh 2010). The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later (Jilani and Grim 2017).\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion\nThis article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures\nto mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms."

The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 21 December 2018 Revised 24 April 2019 Accepted 4 May 2019 ## KEYWORDS Saudi Arabia; Gulf; cybersecurity; hack-and-leak; information operations ## Introduction Confidential documents from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC), its sister organisation, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the email account of John Podesta, chairman of Hilary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, were all leaked online from June to November 2016.² These documents were obtained by an adversary that used 'phishing' – a fraudulent message masquerading as a legitimate request for credentials such as username and password – to gain access to the networks of the above organisations. Investigations by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike indicated that the likely sources of this cyber operation were the Russian internal and external intelligence agencies, the FSB and GRU (although their activities were not coordinated and they separately gained access to many of the same documents). The leaking of these documents had a significant media impact, generating several scandals and headlines about Clinton and her staff. Although it is extremely difficult to tell whether it changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, the leaks themselves and subsequent CONTACT James Shires \\odot James_shires@hks.harvard.edu © 2019 Chatham House investigations into Russian interference with the electoral process damaged the legitimacy of President Trump, and the 2016 democratic process itself, in the eyes of many US citizens and outside observers. This phenomenon -- a politically-motivated leak involving cyber intrusion, which I call a ‘hack-and-leak operation' -- is clearly a new and important element of international politics.\nWhile the DNC operation was framed as a risk to the foundations of liberal democracy, hack-and-leak operations have also been conducted in the context of non- or semi-democratic governments, especially the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the Gulf monarchies, legitimacy is derived, not from competitive electoral processes, but from a complex blend of personal, familial and national identities and carefully controlled access to substantial natural resources. Hack-and-leak operations were a central feature of the June 2017 Gulf crisis, where the ‘quartet' states of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE ‘blockaded' or ‘sanctioned' Qatar (the two sides use different terms) due to accusations of support for terrorist organisations. However, hack-and-leak operations first came to prominence in the Gulf two years earlier, following the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. This article uses the case of the Yemen Cyber Army to answer the question: what are hack-and-leak operations, and how can we understand their impact on international politics?\nThe article progresses in four stages. It begins by defining hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) using theoretical perspectives on both cyber intrusions and political leaks. The second section places HLOs in the context of wider concepts of data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. It then traces the evolution of politically-motivated HLOs from a hacktivist to a state tool and uses this evolution to justify the region selected by this article, the states of the GCC. The third section analyses a crucial hack-and-leak operation that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army. I argue that this incident has two characteristics that make it pivotal for understanding later hack-and-leak operations. First, its coverage challenged the quietist status quo in media outlets in the Gulf, preparing the ground for fierce PR battles during the 2017 Gulf crisis, including several further hack-and-leak operations. Second, a potential technical attribution to Russian intelligence agencies raises the intriguing possibility that it acted as an experiment for Russia's subsequent, and much more effective, hack-and-leak operations around the 2016 US election. The fourth and final section draws on this empirical material to propose a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs on international politics, based on characteristics, contexts and audiences.\n### Defining hack-and-leak operations Hack-and-leak operations involve both an intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak). In this section, I first define the two elements separately and then combine them.\nThere are two broad types of cyber operation: intrusion and interference. The former implies external and unauthorised access to a digital network, including the ability to execute code on that network, while the latter does not require such access, instead ‘merely' denying or restricting the provision of digital services. Both types of cyber operation are external in that they involve communication with points on the targeted network that are connected to the wider internet, from another internet-connected device or network. Due to the global nature of internet traffic and connections, external access does not imply a specific geographical position; external access could be someone in a van sitting outside the target's office building, or in a different country on the other side of the world. Cyber operations are also not exclusively external, as insiders can be a willing or unwitting part of a cyber operation, although their direction and control are nearly always external. The ‘unauthorised' aspect of this definition excludes many forms of external manipulation of digital devices and networks that are common and benign features of the internet: for example, IT administrators rely on remote access to computers to troubleshoot problems. It also rules out the cybersecurity practice of ‘penetration testing', in which organisations offer financial rewards for the discovery of vulnerabilities in their systems, creating at least implicit permission if the appropriate constraints are observed. Most cyberattacks in the narrative of international politics involve intrusion.\nTurning to leaks, there are many ways political actors seek to change the perceptions and behaviour of target audiences, from campaigning to propaganda. Leaks are just one tool in this wider struggle. Leaks are a common feature of both historical and contemporary politics and can be defined as the release of secret information into the public domain outside standard practices of disclosure. This definition does not distinguish between whistleblowing and leaking as morally right and wrong acts respectively. In this sense, it resembles other social scientific treatments of highly morally charged concepts, such as terrorism. Just as terrorism studies focus on terrorism as a method, rather than a condemnatory label, so this definition of leaks identifies a process rather than espousing a specific moral position. Finally, most states have hard legal standards around what is classified as secret information (although these standards differ significantly between states) and many leaks instead concern private or confidential information that does not meet those standards. A leak is thus not a binary transformation from secret to public, but a shift in the direction of publicity along what might be called a ‘spectrum of confidentiality'.\nHack-and-leak operations combine both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences. From an adversary's perspective, there are two main strategic reasons for this combination. First, and most simply, the intrusion might be the easiest way to obtain confidential information. In this case, the hack-and-leak elements would be planned in advance; given the likelihood of a particular target having publicly relevant information, an adversary could seek to leak that information and choose an intrusion as the best means of doing so. Second, and less straightforwardly, leaking might be an unplanned result of an intrusion that originally had a different objective or no clear objective. The DNC case illustrates this well, as no public evidence suggests a prior plan by the GRU to leak emails before the intrusion, and so it may have been a creative response to the access they gained after a successful phishing attempt. In some cases, leaking is explicitly a less desired route, only taken after other goals are thwarted. As Phineas Fisher, the hacker who leaked data from surveillance company Gamma International in 2016, put it: It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while mocking them on twitter.”\nAlthough detecting the difference between a strategically-motivated hack-and-leak operation and one improvised on the fly is very difficult, it is also unnecessary for my argument. The key point is that the combination exists as a tactic available to adversaries and has been used successfully in several cases.\nTwo caveats are required to complete this definition of hack-and-leak operations. First, the ubiquitous presence of digital technologies in modern society means that nearly all leaks have a ‘cyber' element. Contemporary leaks are unlikely to replicate the Pentagon Papers' model of manually photocopying hundreds of paper documents. For example, the Snowden leaks involved a wide range of ‘cyber' means for file access, encryption and secure messaging, even though Snowden's insider status meant that it was very much not a hack-and-leak operation as defined above. Furthermore, given the breadth of technologies and tools falling under the remit of cybersecurity, even those leaks that are relatively distant from hack-and-leak operations can be framed as cyber leaks. A good recent example of this is the leaked recording of the murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Turkish media, probably directed by the Turkish government, implausibly claimed that these recordings had been obtained through an Apple iCloud account that received them from Khashoggi's iPhone (located with his fiancée outside the consulate), which in turn received them from a synched iWatch worn by Khashoggi. This, combined with the installation of surveillance software on the devices of Khashoggi's contacts, meant that these leaks were widely seen as ‘hacked'. Consequently, although hack-and-leak operations, as defined above, are a distinct category of intervention in international politics, there is a wide penumbra of cyber-related leaks surrounding this definition.\nThe second caveat concerns the reliability of data leaked in hack-and-leak operations. Another hack-and-leak operation, targeted at the 2017 presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, included deliberately false and manipulated documents in the leak. The proportion of true and false data varies substantially between leaks and is especially difficult to determine because -- as I illustrate below -- the first response of the target is often to claim that the leak is completely fake. Consequently, hack-and-leak operations fall on both sides of the larger problem of ‘fake news' in the contemporary digital public sphere: on the one hand, they can be used by attackers to inject fake stories into the public domain; on the other hand, they are an easy target of attempts to delegitimize real news by branding it as fake. As Schneier and Farrell (2018) argue, accusations of fake news can be seen as an attack on societies viewed as information systems, because they blur the line between what Schneier and Farrell call ‘common' and ‘contested' political knowledge. The location of this line, and consequently the effect of HLOs, differs in democratic and non-democratic contexts, and I highlight aspects of these differences in the following discussion. For now, the relevant theoretical point is simply that HLOs do not necessarily involve only definitively leaked information but can also thrive off uncertainty over the provenance and reliability of that information.\n\nThere are two concepts closely related to HLOs that serve as a useful starting point for my analysis: data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations. This section provides an overview of each, arguing that they are both broader than HLOs and so the latter concept is a useful analytical addition. It then details the evolution of HLOs in international politics and explains why I select the Gulf as the site in which to investigate HLOs further.\n### Data breaches HLOs can be viewed as part of a larger phenomenon of data breaches, where secret information is not kept securely. Data breaches are ubiquitous, as illustrated by the data visualisation website, ‘information is beautiful', which tracked what it terms the ‘largest' data breaches worldwide from 2004 to 2018. Of the total 294 events in this time period, 180 (61%) were the result of an intrusion or ‘hack'. Similarly, Verizon's annual data breach report for 2018 identified 2,216 data breaches worldwide in 65 countries and stated that 73% of breaches were caused by outsiders. For the Middle East specifically, Infowatch, a subsidiary of the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, released reports in 2017 and 2018 on data breaches in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region relative to their worldwide observations. Their conclusions should be treated with caution, as actual incident numbers are not given and they have commercial incentives to adjust their data (which is not publicly available). With this caveat in mind, Infowatch concluded that 64% of data breaches in MENA in 2018, and 82% in 2017, were due to ‘external attacks', a higher percentage than their worldwide observations, at 37% and 62% respectively. Finally, the UK cybersecurity company Digital Shadows -- with similar caveats necessary -- put the Middle East as second to last in their global data breach measure, which was operationalised as number of credentials leaked online per world region (Digital Shadows 2016). The overall point is unsurprising: there are a large number of significant data breaches worldwide, and a substantial proportion of those -- especially in the Middle East -- are due to cyber intrusions.\nThe concept of a data breach is much broader than that of an HLO, for three reasons. First, data breaches can occur through either cyber or non-cyber means. Second, data breaches can be either accidental or deliberate (e.g. laptops left on trains), whereas HLOs require an adversary to coordinate both the intrusion and release of information. Third, data breaches are not limited to leaks, but also include instances where data is taken but then kept out of the public domain. Consequently, the frequency of data breaches is likely to be far higher than the frequency of HLOs, although it can still serve as a rough guide.\nAlso, the vast majority of data breaches (according to Verizon, around 70% average from 2013--2017) have a financial motivation, with organised criminal groups responsible for around 50% of all breaches. Such breaches are often not very ‘leaky', because the information is not published openly but instead traded on restricted online forums. Consequently, in this article I focus only on politically-motivated HLOs, which use leaked data in a more overt way. Some large data breaches, with neither clearly financial, nor clearly political, motivations -- e.g. the 2014 Sony PlayStation hack -- are excluded from the scope of this article.\n### Cyber-enabled information operations Many cybersecurity scholars, professionals and policymakers have turned their attention to ‘cyber-enabled information operations' after the DNC hack-and-leak operation in 2016. In the US, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a cybersecurity subcommittee session on this topic in April 2017, leading to the appearance of this term in several subsequent publications, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy to describe Russian operations against the US, and a full congressional report requested from the president (through DoD) in October 2018. This term has also spread outside the US: for example, a report written for the Singapore Parliament (a state often seen as a relative leader in cybersecurity) in March 2018 considers the possibility of ‘cyber-enabled information conflicts' in South-East Asia.\nThis policy attention has been matched by academic analysis. Kerr and Lin have proposed the concept of ‘cyber-enabled information/influence warfare and manipulation', defined as ‘the deliberate use of information by one party on an adversary to confuse, mislead, and ultimately to influence the choices and decisions that the adversary makes'. Separately, Omand has located cyber-enabled information operations in the broader historical context of subversion and sedition. He distinguishes these operations from cyber-assisted information operations that simply use the internet to increase the reach of traditional propaganda through known media outlets; in contrast, cyber-enabled operations ‘manipulate opinions and recruit supporters through the unique characteristics of social media'. In addition, Mansted has used the concept of ‘cyber-enabled interference operations', in the Australian context, to address ‘clandestine or deceptive tactical actions [with the] purpose of changing, shaping, or constraining the actions of decision-makers'.\nThe concerns of these authors are wider than this article, including both HLOs and many other forms of disinformation and misinformation that do not involve intrusion. Although ‘HLO' adds yet another term to a growing lexicon, it usefully focuses only on those cases containing both intrusion and influence. This narrower focus is helpful because, as I argue later, intrusion details are a crucial aspect of HLOs. Furthermore, all three authors above highlight the peculiar vulnerabilities of liberal democracies to such operations, while one of the purposes of this article is to complement such analyses through a comparison of non-democratic contexts. This focus builds on work by companies who have traced the way in which, what Francois calls ‘false leaks', spread on social media platforms like Twitter, highlighting how their dissemination through certain hashtags affects their impact. Similarly, researchers at Citizen Lab, a non-profit institution at the University of Toronto, have argued that what they call ‘tainted leaks' of doctored information gained through phishing attacks against journalists and political opponents have been used by the Russian state to ‘seed mistrust' among its domestic civil society. As stated above, HLOs can include tainted elements and this labelling is itself a highly-contested process.\n### Hack-and-leak operations There have been 49 politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to May 2019 (Figure 1). As well as data breaches and cyber-enabled information operations, we can also put this number in the context of other datasets of state-sponsored cyber operations (including both intrusion and interference but excluding politically-motivated non-state actors). For example, the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations Tracker includes 288 state-sponsored offensive cyber operations from 2005--2018. Even this rough comparison suggests that, numerically, HLOs are only a small proportion of offensive cyber operations more broadly. Furthermore, although the well-known limitations for data collection around state-sponsored cyber operations are reduced for HLOs, because the leak element of the operation is observable by definition, there may be some leaks (e.g. Paradise and Panama Papers) that are due to hacks but are not reported as such (BBC News 2017). 49 is thus only a minimum number of politically-motivated HLOs, and the actual frequency may well be higher.\nAs well as the overall count, Figure 1 indicates that HLOs are approximately evenly split between government and private sector targets. There was a decline in 2013--2015, followed by an increase in 2016 and 2017. As the grey line illustrates, HLOs attributed to the hacktivist collective, Anonymous, or related entities, accounted for most early incidents, although following law enforcement action from 2013 onwards, this percentage decreased substantially. There is thus a prima facie shift from hacktivist to state-sponsored or uncertain attribution for HLOs, although this should not be overstated; on the one hand, state actors may have played a role in Anonymous actions by suggesting target lists or similar support, while -- as I show below -- on the other hand, state actions often take place under hacktivist cover. Further details on the data underlying Figure 1 are provided in Appendix.\nThe GCC states are involved (either through attribution or as a victim) in 17 of the 49 instances catalogued in Figure 1 overall, and in 15 of the 36 incidents from 2013 onwards, after the decline in Anonymous activity. This numerical presence is sufficient reason to investigate the Gulf as a key region for HLOs, although two other justifications are also possible. First, the characteristics of HLOs in the Gulf cannot be deduced from the single HLO that has received the most media and scholarly attention -- the DNC operation -- because the political systems and regional environment are quite different to the liberal, democratic nature of domestic US politics. In other words, the effects of HLOs in this region cannot be extrapolated from the US case. Second, HLOs in the Gulf should not be thought of as entirely unconnected to US politics, as there are both similarities in adversary tactics and certain actors involved in both cases.\nMany of the HLOs in the Gulf took place in the context of the 2017 Gulf crisis. An investigation of these incidents is outside the scope of this article and an overview has been ably conducted by Cherkaoui (2018). However, Cherkaoui's account leaves out what I consider to be the key HLO in the Gulf: one that occurred before the Gulf crisis, but which prepared the ground for all the other HLOs related to the crisis itself. Consequently, although my forthcoming work also investigates HLOs related to the Gulf crisis itself in detail, this article takes a step back in time, examining instead the release of thousands of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015. It argues that this step is necessary, both to understand the later development of HLOs in the Gulf, and to understand the relationship between HLOs in the Gulf and those elsewhere, including in the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe following analysis of the Yemen Cyber Army incident is qualitative, using the political science method of ‘process-tracing'. Process-tracing is the creation of a narrative account of an event as it unfolded, seeking to identify key causal junctures and potential alternative paths. This method has one important caveat: as the legality of viewing leaked documents is at best, uncertain, and at most, a violation of cybercrime laws adopted and strengthened throughout the Gulf states since the Arab Spring, this analysis relies only on articles published by local and international news outlets. All conclusions are conditional on the claims regarding content and attribution made by these secondary sources, as they cannot be openly cross-referenced against the primary material due to these legal risks. I highlight key disagreements and reasons for caution regarding the secondary literature where relevant.\n### The Yemen cyber Army The Yemen Cyber Army (al-jaish al-yamani al-‘iliktroni) first appeared on the radar of cybersecurity and Middle East observers in April 2015, just over two years before the Gulf crisis and when GCC diplomatic relations were recovering from the withdrawal of the ambassadors of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Qatar in March 2014. On Monday 13 April 2015, the website of Lebanese Saudi-leaning newspaper Al-Hayat was defaced, and replaced by graphics including a picture of the Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the Hizballah slogan ‘prepare your bomb shelters' (jahizu malaji`akum). The website itself and a message on the site Pastebin, frequently used by hackers to claim responsibility for website defacements, both stated that the ‘Yemen Cyber Army' were responsible for the defacement.\n### MFA operation On 21 May, another Pastebin message was posted by the Yemen Cyber Army, claiming that they had put leaked documents from Saudi embassies online. An analysis of the data by cybersecurity company, Digital Shadows, and the cybersecurity website, Databreaches.net, indicated that the private information of 30,000 citizens and 11,000 Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) personnel was leaked online in two tranches that week, as well as thousands of scanned documents and information about MFA digital networks (Digital Shadows 2015; DataBreaches.net 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The hack and leak were first reported by Iranian website Fars News an hour and a half after the Pastebin message, shortly followed by the Russian news website, Russia Today (Fars News 2015; Russia Today 2015). On the evening of 22 May, the Saudi Press Agency confirmed that a ‘limited' cyberattack (hajmat ʿiliktroniyya mahduda) had occurred (Saudi Press Agency 2015). Messages from the Yemen Cyber Army Twitter account at this time threatened to release a million records a week ‘to stop Saudi attacks [in Yemen]' and to wipe all MFA computers automatically. The latter threat echoed the most damaging cyberattack on Saudi Arabia to date, an automatic wiping of 30,000 computers in the business networks of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, in August 2012. The MFA hack-and-leak was named ‘Operation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi' by the Yemen Cyber Army, after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen, signalling a political motivation (Digital Shadows 2015).\n### Contested attribution Many observers were cautious in their treatment of the Yemen Cyber Army as a ‘genuine' hacktivist group. This is partly due to the specific Saudi context: the earlier cyberattack against Saudi Aramco had originally been claimed on Pastebin by a group called ‘Cutting Sword of Justice' but was later attributed to Iranian state-linked actors. Journalists from Buzzfeed News who spoke to the Yemen Cyber Army in May 2015 reported that they ‘claimed that they are in Yemen, but they refuse to speak Arabic or answer details about their location'. Other observers used the close timing of the Fars News coverage to the original release in order to attribute the Saudi MFA operation to Iranian actors. Further evidence for this attribution was provided by the leaked documents themselves, some of which suggested that the Saudi MFA had been victim to an Iranian cyber intrusion in late 2014 and early 2015 -- known in the cybersecurity industry as Op CLEAVER -- and had contracted several US cybersecurity companies to investigate the incident.\nHowever, Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade (2016), researchers for the cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, argued that the same Russian actors responsible for the US DNC hack in 2016 (the GRU) were also responsible for the Saudi MFA operation. Given a wider history of masquerading as other actors or ‘false flags' -- including as something called the ‘CyberCaliphate' -- they based their conclusion on three technical similarities between known GRU activities and the MFA operation. First, the GRU actors had obtained access to the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine, in February 2015, through their unique exploitation of a specific zero-day vulnerability. Second, the researchers noted the use of the Russian webmail provider, Yandex, to register domains associated with the Yemen Cyber Army. Third, they highlighted the association of one specific domain involved in the MFA incident (wikisaleaks[.]com) with a DNS service also used by the GRU actors and located its hosting IP address within the same address range as known domains used by the GRU actors. Bartholomew and Guerrero-Sade recognised that this evidence was not conclusive and allowed for the possibility that Iranian actors were given support or technical assistance by the GRU. More generally, as several scholars have recognized, attribution is a complex and multifaceted process, with substantial uncertainty possible in nearly all cases, and especially one where deliberate misdirection is employed. However, if this attribution is correct, the DNC operation should be understood as the more successful rerun of an earlier experiment in the Gulf.\n### Wikileaks release On 19 June, the website WikiLeaks released the first set of what it called ‘The Saudi Cables', a set of around 61,000 documents from the Saudi MFA. WikiLeaks had previously garnered attention due to its release of several large document sets from both governments and private companies, including US diplomatic cables in 2010, and would go on to release the DNC documents in 2016. In its press release, WikiLeaks acknowledged that the Yemen Cyber Army's initial leaks had contributed to its Saudi Cables documents but claimed that they had many more documents than had been released so far, suggesting an arrangement with the Yemen Cyber Army actors for further access. WikiLeaks partnered with several media outlets to publish selected cables and analysis, including the Lebanese paper Al-Akhbar, the Egyptian website Mada Masr, Reporters Without Borders, Süddeutsche Zeitung (which had been involved in the Snowden leaks and several other large leak stories), and The Saturday Paper in Australia. WikiLeaks released another large set of documents from the Saudi MFA in November 2015, generating a second wave of media coverage.\n### Response to WikiLeaks The Saudi government's response immediately condemned the operation and attempted to limit the spread of leaked documents. Immediately after the WikiLeaks release, the Saudi MFA called on citizens to ‘avoid entering any website that exposed them to the documents or false leaked information (muʿalumat masraba qad takun ghir sahiha) intended to harm national security'. The head of the MFA Media Directorate, Osama Nuqali, stated that ‘it was necessary to never help the enemies of the nation (ʿadam musaʿidat ʿiʿdaʿ al-watan)' by sharing these documents, and that it was ‘forbidden in the cybercrime law (nizam jaraʿim al-muʿalumatiyya)'. The government response was not limited to hard power and a repressive legal atmosphere; official messages on Twitter were addressed to ‘aware citizens' (al-muwatin al-waʿi), an appeal to national consciousness that would be noticeably absent in the partisan atmosphere of the US presidential election a year later. The Saudi government response also remained consistent after the initial response had died down, using the sheer number of documents as a reason for claiming that the cables were forged (mazawwara) even as late as in January 2017. It is notable that this later statement also claimed that 85% of security vulnerabilities were down to human error, hinting that the MFA had been compromised through a phishing attack. It also stated that the MFA had adopted a new set of information technology programmes and was working with the newly created national authority for cybersecurity (al-haiʿa al-wataniyya lil-ʿamn al-muʿalumatiyya), signalling a recognition of previous vulnerabilities.\nThe WikiLeaks release generated significant activity on Saudi and regional social media, partly due to high levels of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia. The BBC claimed that around 70,000 tweets in the minutes after this release used the hashtags ‘WikiLeaks' in Arabic and ‘Saudileaks' in English (BBC Trends 2015). The BBC's analysis highlighted how some Saudi Twitter users opposed the leaks, including one who stated that there is ‘nothing in them [the leaked documents] other than renewing centrally what we knew before'. Others said the documents were ‘routine and normal speeches' (rutiniyya wa khutabat `adiyya) and claimed the operation was a ‘conspiracy' (mu`amar). Still others said that the leaks were fabricated (mufabrak) but echoed the government's interpellation of its people as ‘understanding and aware' (fahim wa wa`i), speculating that ‘the news is evidence of deteriorating Saudi-US relations'. The Sasapost article, cited above, also highlighted negative responses. For example, Twitter user, Masoud Al-Fuhaid, asked, ‘how does it benefit the people when documents are exposed to the public (`arad witha`iq lil-`ama) to damage the national interest and foreign relations; acts criminalised even by longstanding democracies (hiya `if`al tajarramha hata al-dimuqratiyyat al-`ariqa)?'. However, given the presence of massive bot networks used to support government claims and flood Twitter in order to counterbalance negative publicity, it is difficult to assess the extent of genuine positive or negative responses to the WikiLeaks release in the Saudi Arabian Twittersphere.\n### Wider impact After this initial burst, a variety of news organisations reported on the leaks over the next few months, and their stories covered four main areas of Saudi foreign policy. First, what the New York Times called an ‘obsession' with Iran, including the shipment of Iranian centrifuges to Sudan in 2012, and related concern with other interpretations of Islam, including Shia in Egypt and Yemen and Ahmaddiyya in Indonesia.Second, regional influence, including strategies to remove Bashar Al-Assad in Syria and political and financial relationships across the region, especially in Iraq, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Lebanon. Some reports in this vein focused specifically on media influence, including in Egypt, Canada and Australia.Third, attempts to increase influence in the United Nations, including on the Human Rights Council through vote trading with the UK and Russia.Fourth, and finally, a few reports examined what the documents revealed about social norms in Saudi Arabia, including criticism of the extent to which sensitive individual information was put online by WikiLeaks.\nTwo overall points can be made about the impact of this coverage. The first is that the stories largely confirmed the assessments of many individuals in -- and scholars of -- the region, as the Twitter users above noted. Studies of Saudi Arabia have long emphasised its symbiosis with a particular version of Islam, both domestically and abroad, its use of media dominance for foreign policy purposes, and its extensive involvement in politics and conflict across the region since the Arab Spring, as well as a growing Saudi-Iran antagonism. The second point is that the coverage largely failed to meet the high expectations of those involved, primed as they were by the global shock of the Snowden leaks in 2013. Many of the sites reporting on the documents set up dedicated channels for analysis, implying, and sometimes specifically stating, that there would be a long and slow release of documents over time to maximise impact. However, these channels dried up after the first few stories. The anticipated impact of this HLO was thus much higher than the subsequent reality, in stark contrast to the DNC case. In the following and final section of this article, I use this discrepancy to think more widely about the impact of HLOs in international politics.\n### Dimensions of impact for HLOs The impact of HLOs can be understood through their role as mechanisms for delegitimization: ways in which adversaries seek to diminish the legitimacy of their target. In this case, the actors behind the Yemen Cyber Army front sought to decrease the legitimacy of the Saudi government by revealing various secret foreign policy decisions. The publicity of the DNC incident generates a default assumption that HLOs are an effective mechanism for delegitimization, however, we cannot necessarily extrapolate from that case to other HLOs, including in the Gulf. In contrast, as I argue below, the Yemen Cyber Army leak was not effective, or at least nowhere near as effective as the DNC operation, for several reasons: it contained difficult-to-parse Arabic documents that were distributed by intermediaries with divergent agendas; there were strict legal and informal constraints on the Saudi public sphere; and it did not have a clear constituency for its reception. This differential impact can be understood along three dimensions of characteristics, context and audiences.\nFirst, the characteristics of HLOs include, first and foremost, the technical details of the operation, often referred to in the cybersecurity industry as tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These include the infrastructure used to conduct the intrusion, the entry points, the tools and patterns of access and methods of data exfiltration. TTPs can be used to identify and prevent intrusions of a similar type to those already experienced or to infer attribution possibilities. The TTPs for HLOs as a category of cyber intrusion do not differ significantly from TTPs for other cyber operations. However, the characteristics of HLOs include two further aspects not normally considered in discussions of TTPs.\nThe characteristics of HLOs also include the size and format of the data exfiltrated. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there were a vast number of documents (60,000), more than could be read or understood by any single person or organisation in a reasonable time frame for media coverage. This type of leak is what Margaret Kwoka calls a ‘deluge leak', defined as ‘mass leaks of records... with which the leakers admit to having had little or no familiarity'. Not all HLOs are deluge leaks, but the act of intrusion makes deluge leaking more likely, as adversaries have an incentive to gather as much information as possible during the potentially limited time in which they have access to the target networks, and only afterwards sift through the results. Furthermore, numerous commentators argued that the format of the Saudi MFA documents -- as scans requiring optical character recognition (OCR) software to make their text searchable -- increased the time taken to parse the information within them. Some, such as Zafir Muhammad Ajami in the UAE newspaper, Al-Khaleej, argued that the Arabic language itself increased the difficulty of this task, requiring native Arabic speakers in WikiLeaks partners such as Al-Akhbar and Mada Masr. In contrast, the English-language emails of the DNC were much more amenable to instant analysis by a wide range of recipients. Crucially, this characteristic means that the form affects the content of the leak; different forms encourage or afford different forms of distribution and so different content is produced as a result. Other forms, such as the leaking of source code itself, offer very different possibilities for exploitation, including the direct re-use of that code for intrusion as well as political influence.\nA corollary of this is that the impact of HLOs is highly dependent on intermediaries. In the Yemen Cyber Army case, there was a central intermediary -- WikiLeaks -- with extensive experience in publishing secret government documents, which immediately shaped the expectations of other media organisations. As in the DNC case, WikiLeaks' own motivations and interests become a key part of the HLO, with its initial press release suggesting a narrative of Saudi Arabia that was taken up by most subsequent stories. However, one difference between the DNC and the Yemen Cyber Army cases is that, in the latter, there were several other key intermediaries, partly due to the language challenges mentioned above. This proliferation of intermediaries with different priorities diluted the focus of the leak, suggesting that the original hackers -- whatever their identity -- had very little direction over the eventual impact of the operation. Overall, the characteristics of HLOs clearly affect its impact, in terms of TTPs, the form and size of data and intermediary practices and motivations.\nThe second dimension along which the impact of HLOs can be measured is ‘context', meaning that the political and social context of the operation affects the outcome in ways that can best be seen in comparative perspective. In contrast to the liberal, partisan and antagonistic quality of the US public sphere, in Saudi Arabia, repressive cybercrime laws, overt media control and extensive self-censorship mean that the spread of leaked documents could be restricted technically and with threats of legal sanction. Appeals to awareness, responsibility and national cohesion received some support, while the reliability and sensitivity of the documents were also successfully downplayed, with pro-government sources repeatedly describing them as forgeries.\nHowever, we should not assume that political and social contexts are entirely independent of HLOs, as HLOs themselves can alter such contexts. In the case considered here, the Saudi MFA leak continued a wider trend in Middle East media away from a quietist, censored, public sphere, to one where there is much more explicitly polarised debate. This trend can be traced back to the rise of satellite television and new channels such as Al Jazeera, although a critical juncture in this trend was of course the Arab Spring. As well as the widely discussed role of social media networks in facilitating protests across the Arab world in 2011, Bachrach (2011) has argued specifically that the WikiLeaks release of the US cables itself was a proximate cause of the Tunisian uprisings, as it starkly demonstrated the extent of -- already suspected -- corruption and inequality. To put this trend in relation to the US, much has been made of the Russian use of ‘kompromat' as a disinformation tactic to discredit and delegitimize opponents, putting the DNC operation in a longer context of bipolar competition between the US and Russia. However, kompromat is not only not part of the Gulf political culture, but has been considered positively alien to it, with an emphasis instead on personal relationships and private disagreements. The Yemen Cyber Army case thus further shifted the political context of Gulf politics towards an acceptance of the tactic of kompromat, laying the ground for personally-targeted revelations about parties on both sides of the Gulf crisis two years later.\nThe third and last dimension of impact for HLOs is ‘audiences'. The plural form is necessary because HLOs do not have a single effect on the public sphere per se but have very different effects on different audiences. The delegitimization that HLOs seek to achieve is thus targeted in relation to a particular audience. Again, a comparative perspective highlights how the DNC operation generates assumptions that do not necessarily hold for all HLOs. Although the relevant audience for the DNC operation was plausibly the US domestic population -- putting aside questions of fragmentation within that population (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) -- this is not the case for the Saudi MFA operation. Instead, the relevant audiences were just as much international allies and supporters as they were Saudi citizens. Finally, returning to the assessment of Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade -- that Russian state actors were responsible for both operations cited in the previous section -- the Saudi MFA leak could have acted as an experiment for the DNC operation, allowing these actors to hone their targeting of specific audiences and learn how best to manipulate their relationship with WikiLeaks. The contrast between the impact of the Saudi MFA operation and the US DNC leaks suggests that these actors may have learnt these lessons very well.\n## Conclusion This article has put forward hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category of cyber operations relevant to cyber policy and international politics. It first defined HLOs as the combination of both a cyber intrusion and a leak designed to influence certain audiences and identified plausible strategic rationales for engaging in HLOs. The article then provided an overview of politically-motivated HLOs from 2011 to 2018, putting the frequency of HLOs in the context of data breaches and state-sponsored cyber and influence operations. The third section explored the first HLO in the Gulf -- the leaking of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- in detail, tracing the process of the leak from these hackers to WikiLeaks, social media and international news organisations. Finally, the fourth section used this case study to introduce three dimensions of the impact of HLOs: characteristics, contexts and audiences. The discussion here was necessarily preliminary, as each of these dimensions requires further work to ground it both theoretically in political science and area studies literature and empirically in a wider range of cases of HLOs. The more modest aim of this section is merely to provide the starting point for a more precise understanding of the impact of HLOs on international politics.\nEven so, this article has three initial implications for cyber policy. First, policymakers should recognise hack-and-leak operations as a distinct tactic deployed by adversaries and should develop mitigation strategies that counter both the intrusion and influence elements of such operations in tandem, rather than as separate phenomena. Second, policymakers -- especially in the US -- should look globally to learn from other instances of HLOs, both because HLOs elsewhere often provide a useful comparative perspective and because the same actors may move between US and non-US targets and refine their tactics accordingly. Third, the deep question of legitimacy raised by HLOs requires policymakers to understand how exactly their different levels and sources of legitimacy relate to one another in respect to particular audiences and how this legitimacy might be diminished. This last angle carries with it a significant danger: that excessive measures to mitigate the risk of HLOs can themselves undermine the legitimacy targeted by HLOs. Consequently, policymakers should identify constructive steps that both reduce the risk of hack-and-leak operations while preserving key rights and freedoms."

    "abstract": "Events such as the leaking of hacked emails from the US Democratic National Committee before the 2016 presidential election sit between two paradigms of cybersecurity. The first paradigm focuses on intrusion (unauthorised access to networks), while the second concentrates on influence (the use of digital technologies to shift public debate). Analyses generally tackle one of these two aspects: cybersecurity specialists focus on intrusion, setting aside the complexities of the digital public sphere, while media scholars do the opposite, closely analysing flows of leaked information without considering how it was obtained. This article instead argues for conceptualising hack-and-leak operations (HLOs) as a distinct category, through a close analysis of a crucial HLO that has been overlooked by the cybersecurity literature: the release of documents from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the 'Yemen Cyber Army'. It proposes a tripartite framework for understanding the impact of HLOs as mechanisms of delegitimization, based on their technical characteristics, social and political context and target audiences. The article suggests that the Yemen Cyber Army incident could have been an experiment for the same Russian actors who carried out the DNC operation, allowing them to hone their tactics prior to the US elections.",
