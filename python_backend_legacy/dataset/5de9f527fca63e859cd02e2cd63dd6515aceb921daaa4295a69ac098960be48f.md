Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as \"grey zones.\" Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴\nThe Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has\n1.

In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey\nG.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

This legal ambiguity, also known as \"grey zones\" by Schmitt, will enable states to use international law as a tool to justify their actions.\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber warfare,\" and \"cyber operation.\" This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS\nThe literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber operation,\" and \"cyber\n¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[63:2]\nwarfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³\nThe most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵\nDespite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n20. See, e.g., Kilovaty, *supra* note 1, at 92; Hathaway et al., *supra* note 4, at 826–37; Arie J.

The first controversy refers to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors, asking whether they are considered “cyberattacks” under the law of armed conflict.²⁹ The second controversy concerns whether an operation must result in physical damage in order to be considered a cyberattack, or whether physical damage that was reasonably expected is sufficient, even if the actual outcomes of the attack did not have such effect.³⁰\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³\nIn respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶\n27.

LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE\nOona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹\nDue to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n37.

For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55\nThirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and\n47.

Of course, cyber operations may also cause physical damage and even fatalities. Such effects, as previously discussed, distinguish cyber operations from cyberattacks.\n52.

Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59\nFourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61\nFinally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64\n## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE\nThe initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n57.

The Tallinn Manual Project\nIn addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\n91.

Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention\nThe first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted\n111.

Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126\nWith regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n120.

Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n140.

First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what\nWhy States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193\nIn summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n187.

Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹\nLOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵\nThe Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷\nThe Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only\n199.

Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system.

Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵\nThe second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage\n223.

LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238\nIt is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or ...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243\nIn summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n234.

This principle requires taking into account the expected damage to civilians while achieving military advantage from the operation. Again, since “cyber infrastructures” may be “dual-use,” it is difficult to assess whether the expected damage might be disproportionate and harm also civilians.²⁴⁷ Lastly, precaution is also difficult to apply since cyberspace is interconnected, and it is hard to distinguish infrastructures used by the military and civilians.²⁴⁸ Regarding cyber operations to which LOAC does not apply, we can find cyber operations conducted outside armed conflict or non-international cyber operations in which the involved party cannot prove itself as an “organisation.”²⁴⁹ Such situations are covered by other bodies of law rather than LOAC.²⁵⁰\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n245.

As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶\nAppealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶²\nThus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n255.

Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G.

Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for \"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\" if it is \"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also, \"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless, \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283\nLiterature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n274.

Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³\nTo summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n292.

Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n305.

The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹\nWith regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²²\nThe due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵\nSupporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n314.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n326.

While France and the Netherlands determined that “a use of force need not be destructive or injurious,”347 the US, Israel, and Australia share the view that a cyber operation can be considered as use of force only if it results in physical harm.348 This suggests cyber-capable countries, such as the United States, Israel and Australia, find that only the most serious cyber incidents – which rarely occur in practice – are uses of force and legitimize less serious cyber incidents, whose damage is not physical (which are much more common). This can be analysed as a cynical use of international law.\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349\nSecond, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use\n346.

Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage.

This example strengthens the claim that much like legal cynicism in domestic contexts, international “law and the agents of its enforcement...are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”362\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements.

First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373\nIn addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION\nDespite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n371.

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as\"grey zones.\"Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE GREY ZONES... 243 CONCLUSION... 248 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) In 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴ The Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] expressed concerns over the growing risk that cyber activities pose to its national security.¹¹ Thus, as states continue to advance technologically, international law rules that govern use of force must be adjusted, through a process of conflict and contestation, cooperation and growth.¹² However, despite this growing international concern, international law of armed conflict (LOAC) has yet to develop an adequate fitted model. In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

A/RES/67/27, at 2 (Dec. 3, 2012).\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber warfare,\"and\"cyber operation.\"This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber operation,\"and\"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] For clarity and simplicity, this Article adopts the definition of the Tallinn Manual for cyberattack, noting the existing controversies and varying interpretations.³⁷ ## II. LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nSecondly, unlike kinetic war, cyber operations may cause serious damage to critical infrastructure without causing any physical damage;51 operations within cyberspace may cause severe non-physical damage, including the destruction of banking systems and computers, harm of sensitive information and data, damage to government digital networks, and disruption of essential governmental services.52 Although these effects are all severe, they are not physical. For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nIn 2004, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was founded by the United Nations and has held five sessions to date.74 Three of the sessions are considered to be successful in “outlining the global cybersecurity agenda and introducing the applicability of international law to state behaviour in cyberspace.”75 As explained by Eneken Tikk-Ringas, the first session (2004/2005) was unsuccessful in producing a report, due to lack of consensus.76 The second GGE session (2009/2010) aimed to continue studying the current and emerging information security threats and ways to resolve them.77 This session started the discussion among states regarding standards of use related to information and communication technology (ICT).78 Tikk-Ringas continues her explanation by stating that the third GGE session (2012/2013) focused on states’ behaviour and expanded the discussion into two separate dialogues: “applicability of international law [to ICT] and norms of responsible state behaviour.”79 Prior to the third session, in 2011, Russia, China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan offered an “International VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] code of conduct for information security.”80 Moreover, the third session was notable because Russia and China, for the first time, publicly stated that “international law is applicable to cyberspace.”81 The fourth GGE session (2014/2015) dealt with “norms, rules, and principles for the responsible behaviour of States (chapter 3) separately from how international law applies to the use of ICTs (chapter 6).”82 The former was considered to be “voluntary, non-binding norms” that do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.”83 The United States used the fourth GGE session to verify “existing principles of international law… identify and analyze rules and norms of behaviour that should govern the use of cyberspace.”84 The report of the fourth session “relates to the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and affirms the IHL [international humanitarian law] principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction.”85 This session was significant and invited experts from many UN Member States, including “Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States.”86 The consequent reports of those sessions reflect some of the points on which consensus was achieved between the Member States.87 Opposed to these three successful sessions, “the fifth and…last session” so far (2017) failed as a result of “fundamental disagreements” between the 25 members of the GGE group.88 Therefore, this session, similar to the first one, also did not produce a consensus report.89 The UN activities mentioned above and the resolutions that have been adopted over time by different committees show that international cyber norms are slowly emerging, even though this process is highly dynamic.90\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## A. The Tallinn Manual Project\nIn addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] 1977,¹⁰² and The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,¹⁰³ as well as the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Despite the international efforts described above and the significant development with the Tallinn Manuals, attempts to create binding international law applicable to cyber warfare have been unsuccessful.\nAdditionally, while the Tallinn process and manuals provide useful commentary on the application of existing international law to cyber operations, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and several significant issues remain highly contested (as will be detailed in sub-sections B through F below).¹⁰⁵ Indeed, most scholars agree that “international law applies to cyber warfare.”¹⁰⁶ For example, the UN Secretary-General has acknowledged that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable [to cyberwarfare].”¹⁰⁷ Likewise, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, “has stated that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.”¹⁰⁸ Finally, the Tallinn Group unanimously concluded that “both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello apply to cyber operations.”¹⁰⁹ However, some of the issues raised by cyberattacks are not clearly addressed by existing international law.¹¹⁰ This gap is\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAccordingly, while many of the current treaties and agreements under international law apply to cyberattacks, they do not do so explicitly.¹¹³ The UN Charter, for example, offers a legal framework for an international convention regulating cyber operations, yet it seems that it is unable to address all the complexities involved in such a war.¹¹⁴ In his Article, Schmitt identifies seven key grey zones concerning the application of international law to cyber warfare, including sovereignty, use of force, self-defence, and attribution.¹¹⁵ This Article adopts and discusses these seven grey zones, as well as countermeasures. Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## C. Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nReese Nguyen explains that the target-based approach is based on the entity being targeted; for example, an attack on critical infrastructure, such as important “systems and assets,” can be considered a use of force.¹⁵⁶ This approach focuses on “critical infrastructure with special status”¹⁵⁷ and defines “any cyber operation against such infrastructure as an ‘armed attack.’”¹⁵⁸ This approach is itself limited though, especially since different countries may have different definitions of “critical infrastructure.”¹⁵⁹ For instance, the US Congress defines critical infrastructure as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹⁶⁰ Second, while the previous approach was criticized for being under-inclusive, scholars argue that the target-based approach is “over-inclusive” as it extends the chances that a cyber operation might be considered as use of force.¹⁶¹ This might undermine international security by increasing the likelihood of war.¹⁶² According to this approach, it is sufficient that a cyber operation would merely attack a highly important infrastructure of a state in order to be considered as a use of force justifying self-defence as a response.¹⁶³ For example, under this approach, Iran should have been allowed to respond with force to the Stuxnet operation.¹⁶⁴ Similarly, the cyber operations against Estonia should have been considered a use of force, even though not much damage was done.¹⁶⁵ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] Next, with regard to the second question of self-defence, according to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), “not every use of force rises to the level of armed attack.”166 It is essential to understand the difference between a use of force and an armed attack as the former seeks to “determine whether a state has violated Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and the related customary international law prohibition,”167 while the latter determines “whether the target state may respond to an act with a use of force without itself violating the prohibition on using force.”168 “Only in the event that the use of force reaches the threshold of an armed attack, is a state entitled to respond using force in self-defence.”169 Thus, it is necessary to consider the “scale and effects” of a cyber operation in order to determine whether it reaches the level of an armed attack.170 The “scale and effects” criteria were introduced in the ICJ Nicaragua judgment to differentiate actions that are considered armed attacks and actions that are not.171 The ICJ “distinguish[es] the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms but provided no further guidance in this regard.”172 Therefore, the dispute regarding the “scale and effects” criteria is still unresolved.173 The Tallinn Group agreed that “any use of force that injures or kills persons or damages or destroys property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement” to be considered as an armed attack.174 However, they did not reach a consensus on the exact point of the severity of injury and damage in terms of how much harm a cyber operation needs to cause to people or property in order to qualify as an armed attack.175 In fact, the international community has never managed to unambiguously identify any international cyber operations approaching the level of an armed attack, including incidents such as the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.176 The Tallinn Group\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAdditionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1024-25 (2007); Nguyen, supra note 140, at 1127.\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] matters - only cyber operations that harm people or cause physical damage to property should be considered armed attacks; others focused on the extent of the consequences, as illustrated by the example of an “incident directed against the New York Stock Exchange that causes the market to crash.”187 As such a scenario may cause no more than economic damage, it was controversial among the Tallinn Group experts.188 Finally, the last unsettled issue relates to the effects of the cyber operation.189 The Tallinn Group “agreed that all reasonably foreseeable consequences” should be considered in order to qualify a certain cyber operation as an armed attack.190 For example, cyber operations “targeting a water purification plant” should be considered as an armed attack as their effects are reasonably expected - people can become very ill or even die as a result of “drinking contaminated water.”191 Yet, the Tallinn Group did not reach a consensus as to whether these effects need to be intentional. For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nD. Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹ LOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵ The Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷ The Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] cyber incidents that reach the level of an “attack” can be regulated under LOAC Rules.²¹² With regards to non-international armed conflicts, the Manual defines them as “protracted armed violence, which may include or be limited to cyber operations [between certain armed groups]” (Rule 23).²¹³ The Manual also mentions that LOAC can apply only if the conflict reaches a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict, such as “individual... or groups of hackers,” show a “minimum degree of organization.”²¹⁴ This means that “cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to non-international armed conflict.”²¹⁵ One of the main challenges with *jus in bello* is applying LOAC “principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution” to cyber operations.²¹⁶ These principles are “codified in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) [²¹⁷ and]… customary international law [and are] applicable both in international and non-international armed conflicts.”²¹⁸ The principle of distinction limits the legitimate targets only to “combatants or military objects” in order to protect civilians.²¹⁹ However, cyberspace is a domain being used by both the army and the civilian population, which makes distinction much more challenging,²²⁰ yet still possible, as in the case of Stuxnet. Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system. However, attacks\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAnother critical question, posed by Yohannes Eneyew Ayalew, concerns the personnel who usually conduct cyber operations, namely hackers: “[a]re [they] a legitimate target?”²²⁴ Are they protected under LOAC? Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] that could be achieved, but evaluating this proportionality in cyberspace is even harder due to the “interconnected nature of cyberspace.”234 Another important principle is precaution. LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] rare. As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶ Appealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## F. Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution\nIn addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors. As Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne articulate, this\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] issue of responsibility and attribution is divided between technical and legal characteristics.274 The\"technical problem\"is to pinpoint the source of a specific cyber operation.275 The\"legal problem\"is to determine the criteria for faulting a state for cyber operations\"by nonstate actors.\"276 The main reason for these problems, as articulated by Efrony and Shany, is that cyberspace possesses distinct features, such as providing a platform for people to act clandestinely.277 The possibility to conduct cyber operations clandestinely relying on capabilities to hide IP addresses, as well as the reliance on\"hacker groups or 'hacktivists'\"rather than formal state institutions, generates these issues.278 However, in order to attribute responsibility, it is necessary to identify the physical computers and devices used by the attacker and identify the state responsible for that attacker.279 A victim state could legally respond to an attack only after identifying these details.280 Beyond these factual challenges, the legal standard of attributing cyber operations to states is also challenging. Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for\"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\"if it is\"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also,\"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless,\"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nUnited States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua... would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.²⁸⁹ Accordingly, effective control, as articulated in Nicaragua, means that the State must have either “directed or enforced” the specific unlawful operations.²⁹⁰ In the Tadic case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted the overall control standard, which is more tolerant and provides that a state can be responsible for an operation conducted by a certain group (or individual), which was endorsed by a state.²⁹¹ The effective control test is problematic when applied to cyberspace due to the high level of proof that is unlikely to be achieved given the difficult task VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of identifying the origin of a cyber operation.²⁹² Further, even the tolerant overall control standard has been criticized as unrealistic when it comes to the attribution of cyber operations.²⁹³ This is because attributing a cyber operation to a certain state depends on the ability to prove the extent of the involvement of a state, such as if a state “direct[ed] private individuals or groups to conduct the operations.”²⁹⁴ This kind of proof is also hard to achieve as cyber operations can be carried out by non-state actors without expending a large amount of funds and with different technology than States.²⁹⁵ Thus, attributing an action of a non-state actor to a state might be very difficult.²⁹⁶ Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that it is still unknown whether the Russian Federation was in some way involved in the “2007 cyber operations” against Estonia that were partially conducted by a hacking group named the Nashi youth.²⁹⁷ The Tallinn Group noted that, “[i]nternational law regulates cyber operations by non-State actors [that are not attributed to a State] only in limited cases.”(Rule 33).²⁹⁸ First, it applies Article 11 of the Articles of State Responsibility, providing that a state is allowed to acknowledge a cyber operation conducted by a non-state actor as its own conduct.²⁹⁹ The Tallinn Group further stated that “cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that are not attributable to States” cannot breach international law rules, such as the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention and cannot be considered as use of force. Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³ To summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## H. Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] defence.³¹⁴ The third unsettled issue is whether cyber operations that are conducted independently by non-state actors are thus armed attacks which would justify a state acting in self-defence.³¹⁵ Another unsettled issue concerns actions that do not cause “injury, death, damage or destruction” but result in “negative effects.”³¹⁶ The last question, which relates to the issue of “reasonably foreseeable consequences,” is if the perpetrator’s intent in regard to the outcome of a cyber operation matters.³¹⁷ Under the grey zone of LOAC, there were four questions provided by Ayalew and Diamond, deriving from the application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## IV. LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] “supreme judicial authority” leads to divergence in the application of LOAC norms to specific cases and to unresolved legal disputes.³³⁶ Another aspect of legal cynicism is the servitude to powerful states’ interests and agendas.³³⁷ For example, Jochen von Bernstorff argues that there has been a recurring trend in the development of LOAC to prohibit weapons during “future armed conflicts” that have lost their relevance and effectiveness.³³⁸ Bernstorff also posits the example of suspending the use of weapons that “are not yet ready to be used for military purposes” or weapons that are no longer effective to use in warfare because of other military innovations.³³⁹ Despite the fact that such restrictions have no appreciable humanitarian effects, powerful states may present them as a significant achievement.³⁴⁰ In contrast, relevant weapons, such as those used for cyber operations, would have no restrictions imposed on them or only the governments that are unable to use them would limit them (similar to the nuclear weapons regime).³⁴¹ To demonstrate this legal cynicism when adapting international law to cyberspace, this section focuses on the grey zone of use of force under jus ad bellum.³⁴² First, it is important to examine the legal perspectives of Israel, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and France concerning the applicability of use of force to cyber operations.³⁴³ The analysis of the positions of these states demonstrates two significant aspects of legal cynicism: (i) a degree of uncertainty concerning the legal rules, based on different interpretations of relevant countries in their application of the legal rules;³⁴⁴ and (ii) expressions of legal interpretations that are consistent with, and reflecting of, states’ political and military interests.³⁴⁵\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage. The failure of the international community to condemn the Stuxnet attack as a breach of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] illustrates the ambiguity of international law and constructs it as non-juridical and cynical.\nIn summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] * * *",

      "## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an"

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as\"grey zones.\"Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE GREY ZONES... 243 CONCLUSION... 248 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) In 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴ The Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] expressed concerns over the growing risk that cyber activities pose to its national security.¹¹ Thus, as states continue to advance technologically, international law rules that govern use of force must be adjusted, through a process of conflict and contestation, cooperation and growth.¹² However, despite this growing international concern, international law of armed conflict (LOAC) has yet to develop an adequate fitted model. In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

A/RES/67/27, at 2 (Dec. 3, 2012).\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber warfare,\"and\"cyber operation.\"This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.",
    "## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber operation,\"and\"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.": "VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] For clarity and simplicity, this Article adopts the definition of the Tallinn Manual for cyberattack, noting the existing controversies and varying interpretations.³⁷ ## II. LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nSecondly, unlike kinetic war, cyber operations may cause serious damage to critical infrastructure without causing any physical damage;51 operations within cyberspace may cause severe non-physical damage, including the destruction of banking systems and computers, harm of sensitive information and data, damage to government digital networks, and disruption of essential governmental services.52 Although these effects are all severe, they are not physical. For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nIn 2004, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was founded by the United Nations and has held five sessions to date.74 Three of the sessions are considered to be successful in “outlining the global cybersecurity agenda and introducing the applicability of international law to state behaviour in cyberspace.”75 As explained by Eneken Tikk-Ringas, the first session (2004/2005) was unsuccessful in producing a report, due to lack of consensus.76 The second GGE session (2009/2010) aimed to continue studying the current and emerging information security threats and ways to resolve them.77 This session started the discussion among states regarding standards of use related to information and communication technology (ICT).78 Tikk-Ringas continues her explanation by stating that the third GGE session (2012/2013) focused on states’ behaviour and expanded the discussion into two separate dialogues: “applicability of international law [to ICT] and norms of responsible state behaviour.”79 Prior to the third session, in 2011, Russia, China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan offered an “International VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] code of conduct for information security.”80 Moreover, the third session was notable because Russia and China, for the first time, publicly stated that “international law is applicable to cyberspace.”81 The fourth GGE session (2014/2015) dealt with “norms, rules, and principles for the responsible behaviour of States (chapter 3) separately from how international law applies to the use of ICTs (chapter 6).”82 The former was considered to be “voluntary, non-binding norms” that do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.”83 The United States used the fourth GGE session to verify “existing principles of international law… identify and analyze rules and norms of behaviour that should govern the use of cyberspace.”84 The report of the fourth session “relates to the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and affirms the IHL [international humanitarian law] principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction.”85 This session was significant and invited experts from many UN Member States, including “Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States.”86 The consequent reports of those sessions reflect some of the points on which consensus was achieved between the Member States.87 Opposed to these three successful sessions, “the fifth and…last session” so far (2017) failed as a result of “fundamental disagreements” between the 25 members of the GGE group.88 Therefore, this session, similar to the first one, also did not produce a consensus report.89 The UN activities mentioned above and the resolutions that have been adopted over time by different committees show that international cyber norms are slowly emerging, even though this process is highly dynamic.90\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",

The Tallinn Manual Project": "In addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] 1977,¹⁰² and The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,¹⁰³ as well as the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Despite the international efforts described above and the significant development with the Tallinn Manuals, attempts to create binding international law applicable to cyber warfare have been unsuccessful.\nAdditionally, while the Tallinn process and manuals provide useful commentary on the application of existing international law to cyber operations, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and several significant issues remain highly contested (as will be detailed in sub-sections B through F below).¹⁰⁵ Indeed, most scholars agree that “international law applies to cyber warfare.”¹⁰⁶ For example, the UN Secretary-General has acknowledged that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable [to cyberwarfare].”¹⁰⁷ Likewise, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, “has stated that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.”¹⁰⁸ Finally, the Tallinn Group unanimously concluded that “both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello apply to cyber operations.”¹⁰⁹ However, some of the issues raised by cyberattacks are not clearly addressed by existing international law.¹¹⁰ This gap is\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nAccordingly, while many of the current treaties and agreements under international law apply to cyberattacks, they do not do so explicitly.¹¹³ The UN Charter, for example, offers a legal framework for an international convention regulating cyber operations, yet it seems that it is unable to address all the complexities involved in such a war.¹¹⁴ In his Article, Schmitt identifies seven key grey zones concerning the application of international law to cyber warfare, including sovereignty, use of force, self-defence, and attribution.¹¹⁵ This Article adopts and discusses these seven grey zones, as well as countermeasures. Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.",
    "## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an": "2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",
    "## C. Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence": "*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nReese Nguyen explains that the target-based approach is based on the entity being targeted; for example, an attack on critical infrastructure, such as important “systems and assets,” can be considered a use of force.¹⁵⁶ This approach focuses on “critical infrastructure with special status”¹⁵⁷ and defines “any cyber operation against such infrastructure as an ‘armed attack.’”¹⁵⁸ This approach is itself limited though, especially since different countries may have different definitions of “critical infrastructure.”¹⁵⁹ For instance, the US Congress defines critical infrastructure as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹⁶⁰ Second, while the previous approach was criticized for being under-inclusive, scholars argue that the target-based approach is “over-inclusive” as it extends the chances that a cyber operation might be considered as use of force.¹⁶¹ This might undermine international security by increasing the likelihood of war.¹⁶² According to this approach, it is sufficient that a cyber operation would merely attack a highly important infrastructure of a state in order to be considered as a use of force justifying self-defence as a response.¹⁶³ For example, under this approach, Iran should have been allowed to respond with force to the Stuxnet operation.¹⁶⁴ Similarly, the cyber operations against Estonia should have been considered a use of force, even though not much damage was done.¹⁶⁵ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] Next, with regard to the second question of self-defence, according to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), “not every use of force rises to the level of armed attack.”166 It is essential to understand the difference between a use of force and an armed attack as the former seeks to “determine whether a state has violated Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and the related customary international law prohibition,”167 while the latter determines “whether the target state may respond to an act with a use of force without itself violating the prohibition on using force.”168 “Only in the event that the use of force reaches the threshold of an armed attack, is a state entitled to respond using force in self-defence.”169 Thus, it is necessary to consider the “scale and effects” of a cyber operation in order to determine whether it reaches the level of an armed attack.170 The “scale and effects” criteria were introduced in the ICJ Nicaragua judgment to differentiate actions that are considered armed attacks and actions that are not.171 The ICJ “distinguish[es] the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms but provided no further guidance in this regard.”172 Therefore, the dispute regarding the “scale and effects” criteria is still unresolved.173 The Tallinn Group agreed that “any use of force that injures or kills persons or damages or destroys property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement” to be considered as an armed attack.174 However, they did not reach a consensus on the exact point of the severity of injury and damage in terms of how much harm a cyber operation needs to cause to people or property in order to qualify as an armed attack.175 In fact, the international community has never managed to unambiguously identify any international cyber operations approaching the level of an armed attack, including incidents such as the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.176 The Tallinn Group\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nAdditionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1024-25 (2007); Nguyen, supra note 140, at 1127.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] matters - only cyber operations that harm people or cause physical damage to property should be considered armed attacks; others focused on the extent of the consequences, as illustrated by the example of an “incident directed against the New York Stock Exchange that causes the market to crash.”187 As such a scenario may cause no more than economic damage, it was controversial among the Tallinn Group experts.188 Finally, the last unsettled issue relates to the effects of the cyber operation.189 The Tallinn Group “agreed that all reasonably foreseeable consequences” should be considered in order to qualify a certain cyber operation as an armed attack.190 For example, cyber operations “targeting a water purification plant” should be considered as an armed attack as their effects are reasonably expected - people can become very ill or even die as a result of “drinking contaminated water.”191 Yet, the Tallinn Group did not reach a consensus as to whether these effects need to be intentional. For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nD. Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹ LOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵ The Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷ The Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] cyber incidents that reach the level of an “attack” can be regulated under LOAC Rules.²¹² With regards to non-international armed conflicts, the Manual defines them as “protracted armed violence, which may include or be limited to cyber operations [between certain armed groups]” (Rule 23).²¹³ The Manual also mentions that LOAC can apply only if the conflict reaches a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict, such as “individual... or groups of hackers,” show a “minimum degree of organization.”²¹⁴ This means that “cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to non-international armed conflict.”²¹⁵ One of the main challenges with *jus in bello* is applying LOAC “principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution” to cyber operations.²¹⁶ These principles are “codified in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) [²¹⁷ and]… customary international law [and are] applicable both in international and non-international armed conflicts.”²¹⁸ The principle of distinction limits the legitimate targets only to “combatants or military objects” in order to protect civilians.²¹⁹ However, cyberspace is a domain being used by both the army and the civilian population, which makes distinction much more challenging,²²⁰ yet still possible, as in the case of Stuxnet. Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system. However, attacks\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nAnother critical question, posed by Yohannes Eneyew Ayalew, concerns the personnel who usually conduct cyber operations, namely hackers: “[a]re [they] a legitimate target?”²²⁴ Are they protected under LOAC? Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] that could be achieved, but evaluating this proportionality in cyberspace is even harder due to the “interconnected nature of cyberspace.”234 Another important principle is precaution. LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",
    "## E. Countermeasures": "Since the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] rare. As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶ Appealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",
    "## F. Due Diligence": "Another important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273",
    "## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution": "In addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors. As Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne articulate, this\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] issue of responsibility and attribution is divided between technical and legal characteristics.274 The\"technical problem\"is to pinpoint the source of a specific cyber operation.275 The\"legal problem\"is to determine the criteria for faulting a state for cyber operations\"by nonstate actors.\"276 The main reason for these problems, as articulated by Efrony and Shany, is that cyberspace possesses distinct features, such as providing a platform for people to act clandestinely.277 The possibility to conduct cyber operations clandestinely relying on capabilities to hide IP addresses, as well as the reliance on\"hacker groups or 'hacktivists'\"rather than formal state institutions, generates these issues.278 However, in order to attribute responsibility, it is necessary to identify the physical computers and devices used by the attacker and identify the state responsible for that attacker.279 A victim state could legally respond to an attack only after identifying these details.280 Beyond these factual challenges, the legal standard of attributing cyber operations to states is also challenging. Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for\"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\"if it is\"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also,\"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless,\"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nUnited States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua... would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.²⁸⁹ Accordingly, effective control, as articulated in Nicaragua, means that the State must have either “directed or enforced” the specific unlawful operations.²⁹⁰ In the Tadic case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted the overall control standard, which is more tolerant and provides that a state can be responsible for an operation conducted by a certain group (or individual), which was endorsed by a state.²⁹¹ The effective control test is problematic when applied to cyberspace due to the high level of proof that is unlikely to be achieved given the difficult task VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of identifying the origin of a cyber operation.²⁹² Further, even the tolerant overall control standard has been criticized as unrealistic when it comes to the attribution of cyber operations.²⁹³ This is because attributing a cyber operation to a certain state depends on the ability to prove the extent of the involvement of a state, such as if a state “direct[ed] private individuals or groups to conduct the operations.”²⁹⁴ This kind of proof is also hard to achieve as cyber operations can be carried out by non-state actors without expending a large amount of funds and with different technology than States.²⁹⁵ Thus, attributing an action of a non-state actor to a state might be very difficult.²⁹⁶ Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that it is still unknown whether the Russian Federation was in some way involved in the “2007 cyber operations” against Estonia that were partially conducted by a hacking group named the Nashi youth.²⁹⁷ The Tallinn Group noted that, “[i]nternational law regulates cyber operations by non-State actors [that are not attributed to a State] only in limited cases.”(Rule 33).²⁹⁸ First, it applies Article 11 of the Articles of State Responsibility, providing that a state is allowed to acknowledge a cyber operation conducted by a non-state actor as its own conduct.²⁹⁹ The Tallinn Group further stated that “cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that are not attributable to States” cannot breach international law rules, such as the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention and cannot be considered as use of force. Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³ To summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",
    "## H. Summary": "Using Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] defence.³¹⁴ The third unsettled issue is whether cyber operations that are conducted independently by non-state actors are thus armed attacks which would justify a state acting in self-defence.³¹⁵ Another unsettled issue concerns actions that do not cause “injury, death, damage or destruction” but result in “negative effects.”³¹⁶ The last question, which relates to the issue of “reasonably foreseeable consequences,” is if the perpetrator’s intent in regard to the outcome of a cyber operation matters.³¹⁷ Under the grey zone of LOAC, there were four questions provided by Ayalew and Diamond, deriving from the application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)",
    "## IV. LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE": "It seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] “supreme judicial authority” leads to divergence in the application of LOAC norms to specific cases and to unresolved legal disputes.³³⁶ Another aspect of legal cynicism is the servitude to powerful states’ interests and agendas.³³⁷ For example, Jochen von Bernstorff argues that there has been a recurring trend in the development of LOAC to prohibit weapons during “future armed conflicts” that have lost their relevance and effectiveness.³³⁸ Bernstorff also posits the example of suspending the use of weapons that “are not yet ready to be used for military purposes” or weapons that are no longer effective to use in warfare because of other military innovations.³³⁹ Despite the fact that such restrictions have no appreciable humanitarian effects, powerful states may present them as a significant achievement.³⁴⁰ In contrast, relevant weapons, such as those used for cyber operations, would have no restrictions imposed on them or only the governments that are unable to use them would limit them (similar to the nuclear weapons regime).³⁴¹ To demonstrate this legal cynicism when adapting international law to cyberspace, this section focuses on the grey zone of use of force under jus ad bellum.³⁴² First, it is important to examine the legal perspectives of Israel, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and France concerning the applicability of use of force to cyber operations.³⁴³ The analysis of the positions of these states demonstrates two significant aspects of legal cynicism: (i) a degree of uncertainty concerning the legal rules, based on different interpretations of relevant countries in their application of the legal rules;³⁴⁴ and (ii) expressions of legal interpretations that are consistent with, and reflecting of, states’ political and military interests.³⁴⁵\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage. The failure of the international community to condemn the Stuxnet attack as a breach of\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] illustrates the ambiguity of international law and constructs it as non-juridical and cynical.\nIn summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.",
    "## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This": "2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] * * *"

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as\"grey zones.\"Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE GREY ZONES... 243 CONCLUSION... 248 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) In 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴ The Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] expressed concerns over the growing risk that cyber activities pose to its national security.¹¹ Thus, as states continue to advance technologically, international law rules that govern use of force must be adjusted, through a process of conflict and contestation, cooperation and growth.¹² However, despite this growing international concern, international law of armed conflict (LOAC) has yet to develop an adequate fitted model. In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

A/RES/67/27, at 2 (Dec. 3, 2012).\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber warfare,\"and\"cyber operation.\"This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber operation,\"and\"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] For clarity and simplicity, this Article adopts the definition of the Tallinn Manual for cyberattack, noting the existing controversies and varying interpretations.³⁷ ## II. LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nSecondly, unlike kinetic war, cyber operations may cause serious damage to critical infrastructure without causing any physical damage;51 operations within cyberspace may cause severe non-physical damage, including the destruction of banking systems and computers, harm of sensitive information and data, damage to government digital networks, and disruption of essential governmental services.52 Although these effects are all severe, they are not physical. For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nIn 2004, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was founded by the United Nations and has held five sessions to date.74 Three of the sessions are considered to be successful in “outlining the global cybersecurity agenda and introducing the applicability of international law to state behaviour in cyberspace.”75 As explained by Eneken Tikk-Ringas, the first session (2004/2005) was unsuccessful in producing a report, due to lack of consensus.76 The second GGE session (2009/2010) aimed to continue studying the current and emerging information security threats and ways to resolve them.77 This session started the discussion among states regarding standards of use related to information and communication technology (ICT).78 Tikk-Ringas continues her explanation by stating that the third GGE session (2012/2013) focused on states’ behaviour and expanded the discussion into two separate dialogues: “applicability of international law [to ICT] and norms of responsible state behaviour.”79 Prior to the third session, in 2011, Russia, China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan offered an “International VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] code of conduct for information security.”80 Moreover, the third session was notable because Russia and China, for the first time, publicly stated that “international law is applicable to cyberspace.”81 The fourth GGE session (2014/2015) dealt with “norms, rules, and principles for the responsible behaviour of States (chapter 3) separately from how international law applies to the use of ICTs (chapter 6).”82 The former was considered to be “voluntary, non-binding norms” that do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.”83 The United States used the fourth GGE session to verify “existing principles of international law… identify and analyze rules and norms of behaviour that should govern the use of cyberspace.”84 The report of the fourth session “relates to the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and affirms the IHL [international humanitarian law] principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction.”85 This session was significant and invited experts from many UN Member States, including “Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States.”86 The consequent reports of those sessions reflect some of the points on which consensus was achieved between the Member States.87 Opposed to these three successful sessions, “the fifth and…last session” so far (2017) failed as a result of “fundamental disagreements” between the 25 members of the GGE group.88 Therefore, this session, similar to the first one, also did not produce a consensus report.89 The UN activities mentioned above and the resolutions that have been adopted over time by different committees show that international cyber norms are slowly emerging, even though this process is highly dynamic.90\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## A. The Tallinn Manual Project\nIn addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] 1977,¹⁰² and The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,¹⁰³ as well as the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Despite the international efforts described above and the significant development with the Tallinn Manuals, attempts to create binding international law applicable to cyber warfare have been unsuccessful.\nAdditionally, while the Tallinn process and manuals provide useful commentary on the application of existing international law to cyber operations, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and several significant issues remain highly contested (as will be detailed in sub-sections B through F below).¹⁰⁵ Indeed, most scholars agree that “international law applies to cyber warfare.”¹⁰⁶ For example, the UN Secretary-General has acknowledged that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable [to cyberwarfare].”¹⁰⁷ Likewise, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, “has stated that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.”¹⁰⁸ Finally, the Tallinn Group unanimously concluded that “both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello apply to cyber operations.”¹⁰⁹ However, some of the issues raised by cyberattacks are not clearly addressed by existing international law.¹¹⁰ This gap is\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAccordingly, while many of the current treaties and agreements under international law apply to cyberattacks, they do not do so explicitly.¹¹³ The UN Charter, for example, offers a legal framework for an international convention regulating cyber operations, yet it seems that it is unable to address all the complexities involved in such a war.¹¹⁴ In his Article, Schmitt identifies seven key grey zones concerning the application of international law to cyber warfare, including sovereignty, use of force, self-defence, and attribution.¹¹⁵ This Article adopts and discusses these seven grey zones, as well as countermeasures. Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## C. Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nReese Nguyen explains that the target-based approach is based on the entity being targeted; for example, an attack on critical infrastructure, such as important “systems and assets,” can be considered a use of force.¹⁵⁶ This approach focuses on “critical infrastructure with special status”¹⁵⁷ and defines “any cyber operation against such infrastructure as an ‘armed attack.’”¹⁵⁸ This approach is itself limited though, especially since different countries may have different definitions of “critical infrastructure.”¹⁵⁹ For instance, the US Congress defines critical infrastructure as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹⁶⁰ Second, while the previous approach was criticized for being under-inclusive, scholars argue that the target-based approach is “over-inclusive” as it extends the chances that a cyber operation might be considered as use of force.¹⁶¹ This might undermine international security by increasing the likelihood of war.¹⁶² According to this approach, it is sufficient that a cyber operation would merely attack a highly important infrastructure of a state in order to be considered as a use of force justifying self-defence as a response.¹⁶³ For example, under this approach, Iran should have been allowed to respond with force to the Stuxnet operation.¹⁶⁴ Similarly, the cyber operations against Estonia should have been considered a use of force, even though not much damage was done.¹⁶⁵ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] Next, with regard to the second question of self-defence, according to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), “not every use of force rises to the level of armed attack.”166 It is essential to understand the difference between a use of force and an armed attack as the former seeks to “determine whether a state has violated Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and the related customary international law prohibition,”167 while the latter determines “whether the target state may respond to an act with a use of force without itself violating the prohibition on using force.”168 “Only in the event that the use of force reaches the threshold of an armed attack, is a state entitled to respond using force in self-defence.”169 Thus, it is necessary to consider the “scale and effects” of a cyber operation in order to determine whether it reaches the level of an armed attack.170 The “scale and effects” criteria were introduced in the ICJ Nicaragua judgment to differentiate actions that are considered armed attacks and actions that are not.171 The ICJ “distinguish[es] the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms but provided no further guidance in this regard.”172 Therefore, the dispute regarding the “scale and effects” criteria is still unresolved.173 The Tallinn Group agreed that “any use of force that injures or kills persons or damages or destroys property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement” to be considered as an armed attack.174 However, they did not reach a consensus on the exact point of the severity of injury and damage in terms of how much harm a cyber operation needs to cause to people or property in order to qualify as an armed attack.175 In fact, the international community has never managed to unambiguously identify any international cyber operations approaching the level of an armed attack, including incidents such as the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.176 The Tallinn Group\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAdditionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1024-25 (2007); Nguyen, supra note 140, at 1127.\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] matters - only cyber operations that harm people or cause physical damage to property should be considered armed attacks; others focused on the extent of the consequences, as illustrated by the example of an “incident directed against the New York Stock Exchange that causes the market to crash.”187 As such a scenario may cause no more than economic damage, it was controversial among the Tallinn Group experts.188 Finally, the last unsettled issue relates to the effects of the cyber operation.189 The Tallinn Group “agreed that all reasonably foreseeable consequences” should be considered in order to qualify a certain cyber operation as an armed attack.190 For example, cyber operations “targeting a water purification plant” should be considered as an armed attack as their effects are reasonably expected - people can become very ill or even die as a result of “drinking contaminated water.”191 Yet, the Tallinn Group did not reach a consensus as to whether these effects need to be intentional. For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nD. Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹ LOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵ The Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷ The Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] cyber incidents that reach the level of an “attack” can be regulated under LOAC Rules.²¹² With regards to non-international armed conflicts, the Manual defines them as “protracted armed violence, which may include or be limited to cyber operations [between certain armed groups]” (Rule 23).²¹³ The Manual also mentions that LOAC can apply only if the conflict reaches a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict, such as “individual... or groups of hackers,” show a “minimum degree of organization.”²¹⁴ This means that “cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to non-international armed conflict.”²¹⁵ One of the main challenges with *jus in bello* is applying LOAC “principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution” to cyber operations.²¹⁶ These principles are “codified in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) [²¹⁷ and]… customary international law [and are] applicable both in international and non-international armed conflicts.”²¹⁸ The principle of distinction limits the legitimate targets only to “combatants or military objects” in order to protect civilians.²¹⁹ However, cyberspace is a domain being used by both the army and the civilian population, which makes distinction much more challenging,²²⁰ yet still possible, as in the case of Stuxnet. Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system. However, attacks\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAnother critical question, posed by Yohannes Eneyew Ayalew, concerns the personnel who usually conduct cyber operations, namely hackers: “[a]re [they] a legitimate target?”²²⁴ Are they protected under LOAC? Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] that could be achieved, but evaluating this proportionality in cyberspace is even harder due to the “interconnected nature of cyberspace.”234 Another important principle is precaution. LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] rare. As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶ Appealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## F. Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution\nIn addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors. As Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne articulate, this\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] issue of responsibility and attribution is divided between technical and legal characteristics.274 The\"technical problem\"is to pinpoint the source of a specific cyber operation.275 The\"legal problem\"is to determine the criteria for faulting a state for cyber operations\"by nonstate actors.\"276 The main reason for these problems, as articulated by Efrony and Shany, is that cyberspace possesses distinct features, such as providing a platform for people to act clandestinely.277 The possibility to conduct cyber operations clandestinely relying on capabilities to hide IP addresses, as well as the reliance on\"hacker groups or 'hacktivists'\"rather than formal state institutions, generates these issues.278 However, in order to attribute responsibility, it is necessary to identify the physical computers and devices used by the attacker and identify the state responsible for that attacker.279 A victim state could legally respond to an attack only after identifying these details.280 Beyond these factual challenges, the legal standard of attributing cyber operations to states is also challenging. Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for\"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\"if it is\"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also,\"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless,\"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nUnited States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua... would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.²⁸⁹ Accordingly, effective control, as articulated in Nicaragua, means that the State must have either “directed or enforced” the specific unlawful operations.²⁹⁰ In the Tadic case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted the overall control standard, which is more tolerant and provides that a state can be responsible for an operation conducted by a certain group (or individual), which was endorsed by a state.²⁹¹ The effective control test is problematic when applied to cyberspace due to the high level of proof that is unlikely to be achieved given the difficult task VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of identifying the origin of a cyber operation.²⁹² Further, even the tolerant overall control standard has been criticized as unrealistic when it comes to the attribution of cyber operations.²⁹³ This is because attributing a cyber operation to a certain state depends on the ability to prove the extent of the involvement of a state, such as if a state “direct[ed] private individuals or groups to conduct the operations.”²⁹⁴ This kind of proof is also hard to achieve as cyber operations can be carried out by non-state actors without expending a large amount of funds and with different technology than States.²⁹⁵ Thus, attributing an action of a non-state actor to a state might be very difficult.²⁹⁶ Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that it is still unknown whether the Russian Federation was in some way involved in the “2007 cyber operations” against Estonia that were partially conducted by a hacking group named the Nashi youth.²⁹⁷ The Tallinn Group noted that, “[i]nternational law regulates cyber operations by non-State actors [that are not attributed to a State] only in limited cases.”(Rule 33).²⁹⁸ First, it applies Article 11 of the Articles of State Responsibility, providing that a state is allowed to acknowledge a cyber operation conducted by a non-state actor as its own conduct.²⁹⁹ The Tallinn Group further stated that “cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that are not attributable to States” cannot breach international law rules, such as the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention and cannot be considered as use of force. Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³ To summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## H. Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] defence.³¹⁴ The third unsettled issue is whether cyber operations that are conducted independently by non-state actors are thus armed attacks which would justify a state acting in self-defence.³¹⁵ Another unsettled issue concerns actions that do not cause “injury, death, damage or destruction” but result in “negative effects.”³¹⁶ The last question, which relates to the issue of “reasonably foreseeable consequences,” is if the perpetrator’s intent in regard to the outcome of a cyber operation matters.³¹⁷ Under the grey zone of LOAC, there were four questions provided by Ayalew and Diamond, deriving from the application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## IV. LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] “supreme judicial authority” leads to divergence in the application of LOAC norms to specific cases and to unresolved legal disputes.³³⁶ Another aspect of legal cynicism is the servitude to powerful states’ interests and agendas.³³⁷ For example, Jochen von Bernstorff argues that there has been a recurring trend in the development of LOAC to prohibit weapons during “future armed conflicts” that have lost their relevance and effectiveness.³³⁸ Bernstorff also posits the example of suspending the use of weapons that “are not yet ready to be used for military purposes” or weapons that are no longer effective to use in warfare because of other military innovations.³³⁹ Despite the fact that such restrictions have no appreciable humanitarian effects, powerful states may present them as a significant achievement.³⁴⁰ In contrast, relevant weapons, such as those used for cyber operations, would have no restrictions imposed on them or only the governments that are unable to use them would limit them (similar to the nuclear weapons regime).³⁴¹ To demonstrate this legal cynicism when adapting international law to cyberspace, this section focuses on the grey zone of use of force under jus ad bellum.³⁴² First, it is important to examine the legal perspectives of Israel, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and France concerning the applicability of use of force to cyber operations.³⁴³ The analysis of the positions of these states demonstrates two significant aspects of legal cynicism: (i) a degree of uncertainty concerning the legal rules, based on different interpretations of relevant countries in their application of the legal rules;³⁴⁴ and (ii) expressions of legal interpretations that are consistent with, and reflecting of, states’ political and military interests.³⁴⁵\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage. The failure of the international community to condemn the Stuxnet attack as a breach of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] illustrates the ambiguity of international law and constructs it as non-juridical and cynical.\nIn summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] * * *",

In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it.

This legal ambiguity, also known as \"grey zones\" by Schmitt, will enable states to use international law as a tool to justify their actions. Hence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber warfare,\" and \"cyber operation.\" This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts. ## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber operation,\" and \"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14. VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,",

The first controversy refers to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors, asking whether they are considered “cyberattacks” under the law of armed conflict.²⁹ The second controversy concerns whether an operation must result in physical damage in order to be considered a cyberattack, or whether physical damage that was reasonably expected is sufficient, even if the actual outcomes of the attack did not have such effect.³⁰ The most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶",

LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through",

For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and",

VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution",

Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia. ## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted",

Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an",

Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence *Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N.

VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] approaches has significant shortcomings as they cannot comprehensively differentiate cyber operations from conventional attacks.¹⁴⁰ The effect-based approach assesses use of force according to how serious the consequences are.¹⁴¹ The gravity of the effects is determined by seven criteria as suggested by Schmitt (“Schmitt Analysis”): severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy and responsibility.¹⁴² “Despite being the leading approach” among scholars,¹⁴³ the main problem with these criteria is that they are ambiguous and impractical in assessing whether an attack qualifies as an armed attack,¹⁴⁴ and they do not offer appropriate direction to decision-makers.¹⁴⁵ For example, the application of these criteria against the 2007 cyber operations on Estonia is ambiguous. While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹ The instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical",

Hollis, 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) 229 unanimously determined that “the scale and effects threshold was not reached.”177 As for the 2010 Stuxnet attack, only some members of the Tallinn Group took the position “that the operations had reached the [level of an] armed attack” due to the fact that the Iranian centrifuges were seriously harmed.178 Additionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has",

Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage",

LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or ...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating",

This principle requires taking into account the expected damage to civilians while achieving military advantage from the operation. Again, since “cyber infrastructures” may be “dual-use,” it is difficult to assess whether the expected damage might be disproportionate and harm also civilians.²⁴⁷ Lastly, precaution is also difficult to apply since cyberspace is interconnected, and it is hard to distinguish infrastructures used by the military and civilians.²⁴⁸ Regarding cyber operations to which LOAC does not apply, we can find cyber operations conducted outside armed conflict or non-international cyber operations in which the involved party cannot prove itself as an “organisation.”²⁴⁹ Such situations are covered by other bodies of law rather than LOAC.²⁵⁰ ## E. Countermeasures Since the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are",

Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of",

Due Diligence Another important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269 Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273 ## G.

Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for \"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\" if it is \"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also, \"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless, \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284",

Summary Using Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹ With regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-",

The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international",

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE It seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity.

While France and the Netherlands determined that “a use of force need not be destructive or injurious,”347 the US, Israel, and Australia share the view that a cyber operation can be considered as use of force only if it results in physical harm.348 This suggests cyber-capable countries, such as the United States, Israel and Australia, find that only the most serious cyber incidents – which rarely occur in practice – are uses of force and legitimize less serious cyber incidents, whose damage is not physical (which are much more common). This can be analysed as a cynical use of international law. Further, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use",

VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage.

This example strengthens the claim that much like legal cynicism in domestic contexts, international “law and the agents of its enforcement...are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”362 Finally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour.

In summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare. ## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This",

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as\"grey zones.\"Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE GREY ZONES... 243 CONCLUSION... 248 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) In 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴ The Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] expressed concerns over the growing risk that cyber activities pose to its national security.¹¹ Thus, as states continue to advance technologically, international law rules that govern use of force must be adjusted, through a process of conflict and contestation, cooperation and growth.¹² However, despite this growing international concern, international law of armed conflict (LOAC) has yet to develop an adequate fitted model. In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

A/RES/67/27, at 2 (Dec. 3, 2012).\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber warfare,\"and\"cyber operation.\"This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber operation,\"and\"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] For clarity and simplicity, this Article adopts the definition of the Tallinn Manual for cyberattack, noting the existing controversies and varying interpretations.³⁷ ## II. LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nSecondly, unlike kinetic war, cyber operations may cause serious damage to critical infrastructure without causing any physical damage;51 operations within cyberspace may cause severe non-physical damage, including the destruction of banking systems and computers, harm of sensitive information and data, damage to government digital networks, and disruption of essential governmental services.52 Although these effects are all severe, they are not physical. For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nIn 2004, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was founded by the United Nations and has held five sessions to date.74 Three of the sessions are considered to be successful in “outlining the global cybersecurity agenda and introducing the applicability of international law to state behaviour in cyberspace.”75 As explained by Eneken Tikk-Ringas, the first session (2004/2005) was unsuccessful in producing a report, due to lack of consensus.76 The second GGE session (2009/2010) aimed to continue studying the current and emerging information security threats and ways to resolve them.77 This session started the discussion among states regarding standards of use related to information and communication technology (ICT).78 Tikk-Ringas continues her explanation by stating that the third GGE session (2012/2013) focused on states’ behaviour and expanded the discussion into two separate dialogues: “applicability of international law [to ICT] and norms of responsible state behaviour.”79 Prior to the third session, in 2011, Russia, China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan offered an “International VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] code of conduct for information security.”80 Moreover, the third session was notable because Russia and China, for the first time, publicly stated that “international law is applicable to cyberspace.”81 The fourth GGE session (2014/2015) dealt with “norms, rules, and principles for the responsible behaviour of States (chapter 3) separately from how international law applies to the use of ICTs (chapter 6).”82 The former was considered to be “voluntary, non-binding norms” that do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.”83 The United States used the fourth GGE session to verify “existing principles of international law… identify and analyze rules and norms of behaviour that should govern the use of cyberspace.”84 The report of the fourth session “relates to the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and affirms the IHL [international humanitarian law] principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction.”85 This session was significant and invited experts from many UN Member States, including “Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States.”86 The consequent reports of those sessions reflect some of the points on which consensus was achieved between the Member States.87 Opposed to these three successful sessions, “the fifth and…last session” so far (2017) failed as a result of “fundamental disagreements” between the 25 members of the GGE group.88 Therefore, this session, similar to the first one, also did not produce a consensus report.89 The UN activities mentioned above and the resolutions that have been adopted over time by different committees show that international cyber norms are slowly emerging, even though this process is highly dynamic.90\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## A. The Tallinn Manual Project\nIn addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] 1977,¹⁰² and The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,¹⁰³ as well as the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Despite the international efforts described above and the significant development with the Tallinn Manuals, attempts to create binding international law applicable to cyber warfare have been unsuccessful.\nAdditionally, while the Tallinn process and manuals provide useful commentary on the application of existing international law to cyber operations, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and several significant issues remain highly contested (as will be detailed in sub-sections B through F below).¹⁰⁵ Indeed, most scholars agree that “international law applies to cyber warfare.”¹⁰⁶ For example, the UN Secretary-General has acknowledged that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable [to cyberwarfare].”¹⁰⁷ Likewise, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, “has stated that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.”¹⁰⁸ Finally, the Tallinn Group unanimously concluded that “both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello apply to cyber operations.”¹⁰⁹ However, some of the issues raised by cyberattacks are not clearly addressed by existing international law.¹¹⁰ This gap is\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAccordingly, while many of the current treaties and agreements under international law apply to cyberattacks, they do not do so explicitly.¹¹³ The UN Charter, for example, offers a legal framework for an international convention regulating cyber operations, yet it seems that it is unable to address all the complexities involved in such a war.¹¹⁴ In his Article, Schmitt identifies seven key grey zones concerning the application of international law to cyber warfare, including sovereignty, use of force, self-defence, and attribution.¹¹⁵ This Article adopts and discusses these seven grey zones, as well as countermeasures. Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## C. Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nReese Nguyen explains that the target-based approach is based on the entity being targeted; for example, an attack on critical infrastructure, such as important “systems and assets,” can be considered a use of force.¹⁵⁶ This approach focuses on “critical infrastructure with special status”¹⁵⁷ and defines “any cyber operation against such infrastructure as an ‘armed attack.’”¹⁵⁸ This approach is itself limited though, especially since different countries may have different definitions of “critical infrastructure.”¹⁵⁹ For instance, the US Congress defines critical infrastructure as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹⁶⁰ Second, while the previous approach was criticized for being under-inclusive, scholars argue that the target-based approach is “over-inclusive” as it extends the chances that a cyber operation might be considered as use of force.¹⁶¹ This might undermine international security by increasing the likelihood of war.¹⁶² According to this approach, it is sufficient that a cyber operation would merely attack a highly important infrastructure of a state in order to be considered as a use of force justifying self-defence as a response.¹⁶³ For example, under this approach, Iran should have been allowed to respond with force to the Stuxnet operation.¹⁶⁴ Similarly, the cyber operations against Estonia should have been considered a use of force, even though not much damage was done.¹⁶⁵ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] Next, with regard to the second question of self-defence, according to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), “not every use of force rises to the level of armed attack.”166 It is essential to understand the difference between a use of force and an armed attack as the former seeks to “determine whether a state has violated Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and the related customary international law prohibition,”167 while the latter determines “whether the target state may respond to an act with a use of force without itself violating the prohibition on using force.”168 “Only in the event that the use of force reaches the threshold of an armed attack, is a state entitled to respond using force in self-defence.”169 Thus, it is necessary to consider the “scale and effects” of a cyber operation in order to determine whether it reaches the level of an armed attack.170 The “scale and effects” criteria were introduced in the ICJ Nicaragua judgment to differentiate actions that are considered armed attacks and actions that are not.171 The ICJ “distinguish[es] the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms but provided no further guidance in this regard.”172 Therefore, the dispute regarding the “scale and effects” criteria is still unresolved.173 The Tallinn Group agreed that “any use of force that injures or kills persons or damages or destroys property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement” to be considered as an armed attack.174 However, they did not reach a consensus on the exact point of the severity of injury and damage in terms of how much harm a cyber operation needs to cause to people or property in order to qualify as an armed attack.175 In fact, the international community has never managed to unambiguously identify any international cyber operations approaching the level of an armed attack, including incidents such as the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.176 The Tallinn Group\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAdditionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1024-25 (2007); Nguyen, supra note 140, at 1127.\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] matters - only cyber operations that harm people or cause physical damage to property should be considered armed attacks; others focused on the extent of the consequences, as illustrated by the example of an “incident directed against the New York Stock Exchange that causes the market to crash.”187 As such a scenario may cause no more than economic damage, it was controversial among the Tallinn Group experts.188 Finally, the last unsettled issue relates to the effects of the cyber operation.189 The Tallinn Group “agreed that all reasonably foreseeable consequences” should be considered in order to qualify a certain cyber operation as an armed attack.190 For example, cyber operations “targeting a water purification plant” should be considered as an armed attack as their effects are reasonably expected - people can become very ill or even die as a result of “drinking contaminated water.”191 Yet, the Tallinn Group did not reach a consensus as to whether these effects need to be intentional. For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nD. Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹ LOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵ The Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷ The Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] cyber incidents that reach the level of an “attack” can be regulated under LOAC Rules.²¹² With regards to non-international armed conflicts, the Manual defines them as “protracted armed violence, which may include or be limited to cyber operations [between certain armed groups]” (Rule 23).²¹³ The Manual also mentions that LOAC can apply only if the conflict reaches a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict, such as “individual... or groups of hackers,” show a “minimum degree of organization.”²¹⁴ This means that “cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to non-international armed conflict.”²¹⁵ One of the main challenges with *jus in bello* is applying LOAC “principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution” to cyber operations.²¹⁶ These principles are “codified in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) [²¹⁷ and]… customary international law [and are] applicable both in international and non-international armed conflicts.”²¹⁸ The principle of distinction limits the legitimate targets only to “combatants or military objects” in order to protect civilians.²¹⁹ However, cyberspace is a domain being used by both the army and the civilian population, which makes distinction much more challenging,²²⁰ yet still possible, as in the case of Stuxnet. Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system. However, attacks\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAnother critical question, posed by Yohannes Eneyew Ayalew, concerns the personnel who usually conduct cyber operations, namely hackers: “[a]re [they] a legitimate target?”²²⁴ Are they protected under LOAC? Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] that could be achieved, but evaluating this proportionality in cyberspace is even harder due to the “interconnected nature of cyberspace.”234 Another important principle is precaution. LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] rare. As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶ Appealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## F. Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution\nIn addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors. As Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne articulate, this\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] issue of responsibility and attribution is divided between technical and legal characteristics.274 The\"technical problem\"is to pinpoint the source of a specific cyber operation.275 The\"legal problem\"is to determine the criteria for faulting a state for cyber operations\"by nonstate actors.\"276 The main reason for these problems, as articulated by Efrony and Shany, is that cyberspace possesses distinct features, such as providing a platform for people to act clandestinely.277 The possibility to conduct cyber operations clandestinely relying on capabilities to hide IP addresses, as well as the reliance on\"hacker groups or 'hacktivists'\"rather than formal state institutions, generates these issues.278 However, in order to attribute responsibility, it is necessary to identify the physical computers and devices used by the attacker and identify the state responsible for that attacker.279 A victim state could legally respond to an attack only after identifying these details.280 Beyond these factual challenges, the legal standard of attributing cyber operations to states is also challenging. Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for\"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\"if it is\"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also,\"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless,\"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nUnited States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua... would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.²⁸⁹ Accordingly, effective control, as articulated in Nicaragua, means that the State must have either “directed or enforced” the specific unlawful operations.²⁹⁰ In the Tadic case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted the overall control standard, which is more tolerant and provides that a state can be responsible for an operation conducted by a certain group (or individual), which was endorsed by a state.²⁹¹ The effective control test is problematic when applied to cyberspace due to the high level of proof that is unlikely to be achieved given the difficult task VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of identifying the origin of a cyber operation.²⁹² Further, even the tolerant overall control standard has been criticized as unrealistic when it comes to the attribution of cyber operations.²⁹³ This is because attributing a cyber operation to a certain state depends on the ability to prove the extent of the involvement of a state, such as if a state “direct[ed] private individuals or groups to conduct the operations.”²⁹⁴ This kind of proof is also hard to achieve as cyber operations can be carried out by non-state actors without expending a large amount of funds and with different technology than States.²⁹⁵ Thus, attributing an action of a non-state actor to a state might be very difficult.²⁹⁶ Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that it is still unknown whether the Russian Federation was in some way involved in the “2007 cyber operations” against Estonia that were partially conducted by a hacking group named the Nashi youth.²⁹⁷ The Tallinn Group noted that, “[i]nternational law regulates cyber operations by non-State actors [that are not attributed to a State] only in limited cases.”(Rule 33).²⁹⁸ First, it applies Article 11 of the Articles of State Responsibility, providing that a state is allowed to acknowledge a cyber operation conducted by a non-state actor as its own conduct.²⁹⁹ The Tallinn Group further stated that “cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that are not attributable to States” cannot breach international law rules, such as the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention and cannot be considered as use of force. Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³ To summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## H. Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] defence.³¹⁴ The third unsettled issue is whether cyber operations that are conducted independently by non-state actors are thus armed attacks which would justify a state acting in self-defence.³¹⁵ Another unsettled issue concerns actions that do not cause “injury, death, damage or destruction” but result in “negative effects.”³¹⁶ The last question, which relates to the issue of “reasonably foreseeable consequences,” is if the perpetrator’s intent in regard to the outcome of a cyber operation matters.³¹⁷ Under the grey zone of LOAC, there were four questions provided by Ayalew and Diamond, deriving from the application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## IV. LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] “supreme judicial authority” leads to divergence in the application of LOAC norms to specific cases and to unresolved legal disputes.³³⁶ Another aspect of legal cynicism is the servitude to powerful states’ interests and agendas.³³⁷ For example, Jochen von Bernstorff argues that there has been a recurring trend in the development of LOAC to prohibit weapons during “future armed conflicts” that have lost their relevance and effectiveness.³³⁸ Bernstorff also posits the example of suspending the use of weapons that “are not yet ready to be used for military purposes” or weapons that are no longer effective to use in warfare because of other military innovations.³³⁹ Despite the fact that such restrictions have no appreciable humanitarian effects, powerful states may present them as a significant achievement.³⁴⁰ In contrast, relevant weapons, such as those used for cyber operations, would have no restrictions imposed on them or only the governments that are unable to use them would limit them (similar to the nuclear weapons regime).³⁴¹ To demonstrate this legal cynicism when adapting international law to cyberspace, this section focuses on the grey zone of use of force under jus ad bellum.³⁴² First, it is important to examine the legal perspectives of Israel, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and France concerning the applicability of use of force to cyber operations.³⁴³ The analysis of the positions of these states demonstrates two significant aspects of legal cynicism: (i) a degree of uncertainty concerning the legal rules, based on different interpretations of relevant countries in their application of the legal rules;³⁴⁴ and (ii) expressions of legal interpretations that are consistent with, and reflecting of, states’ political and military interests.³⁴⁵\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage. The failure of the international community to condemn the Stuxnet attack as a breach of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] illustrates the ambiguity of international law and constructs it as non-juridical and cynical.\nIn summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] * * *"

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as \"grey zones.\" Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴\nThe Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has\n1.

In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it.

This legal ambiguity, also known as \"grey zones\" by Schmitt, will enable states to use international law as a tool to justify their actions.\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber warfare,\" and \"cyber operation.\" This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS\nThe literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber operation,\" and \"cyber\n¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[63:2]\nwarfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³\nThe most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵\nDespite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n20. See, e.g., Kilovaty, *supra* note 1, at 92; Hathaway et al., *supra* note 4, at 826–37; Arie J.

The first controversy refers to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors, asking whether they are considered “cyberattacks” under the law of armed conflict.²⁹ The second controversy concerns whether an operation must result in physical damage in order to be considered a cyberattack, or whether physical damage that was reasonably expected is sufficient, even if the actual outcomes of the attack did not have such effect.³⁰\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³\nIn respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶\n27.

LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE\nOona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹\nDue to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n37.

For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55\nThirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and\n47.

Of course, cyber operations may also cause physical damage and even fatalities. Such effects, as previously discussed, distinguish cyber operations from cyberattacks.\n52.

Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59\nFourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61\nFinally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64\n## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE\nThe initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n57.

The few scholars who claim that international law norms do not apply to cyber warfare argue that in reality, and as stated by Bradley Raboin, “the paradigm and structure of international law” cannot adapt to cyber warfare; see, e.g., François Delerue, International Cooperation on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, 24 EUR.

Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention\nThe first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted\n111.

Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126\nWith regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n120.

Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n140.

First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what\nWhy States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193\nIn summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n187.

Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹\nLOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵\nThe Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷\nThe Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only\n199.

Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system.

Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵\nThe second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage\n223.

LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238\nIt is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or ...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243\nIn summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n234.

This principle requires taking into account the expected damage to civilians while achieving military advantage from the operation. Again, since “cyber infrastructures” may be “dual-use,” it is difficult to assess whether the expected damage might be disproportionate and harm also civilians.²⁴⁷ Lastly, precaution is also difficult to apply since cyberspace is interconnected, and it is hard to distinguish infrastructures used by the military and civilians.²⁴⁸ Regarding cyber operations to which LOAC does not apply, we can find cyber operations conducted outside armed conflict or non-international cyber operations in which the involved party cannot prove itself as an “organisation.”²⁴⁹ Such situations are covered by other bodies of law rather than LOAC.²⁵⁰\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n245.

As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶\nAppealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶²\nThus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n255.

Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution\nIn addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors.

Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for \"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\" if it is \"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also, \"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless, \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283\nLiterature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n274.

Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³\nTo summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n292.

Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n305.

The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹\nWith regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²²\nThe due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵\nSupporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n314.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n326.

While France and the Netherlands determined that “a use of force need not be destructive or injurious,”347 the US, Israel, and Australia share the view that a cyber operation can be considered as use of force only if it results in physical harm.348 This suggests cyber-capable countries, such as the United States, Israel and Australia, find that only the most serious cyber incidents – which rarely occur in practice – are uses of force and legitimize less serious cyber incidents, whose damage is not physical (which are much more common). This can be analysed as a cynical use of international law.\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349\nSecond, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use\n346.

Foltz, supra note 350, at 45.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[63:2]\nof force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage.

This example strengthens the claim that much like legal cynicism in domestic contexts, international “law and the agents of its enforcement...are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”362\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case\n362. Ryo, supra note 329, at 1015 (citing David S. Kirk and Andrew V.

First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373\nIn addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION\nDespite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n371.

Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as\"grey zones.\"Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE GREY ZONES... 243 CONCLUSION... 248 2023] MIND THE GAP(S) In 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴ The Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] expressed concerns over the growing risk that cyber activities pose to its national security.¹¹ Thus, as states continue to advance technologically, international law rules that govern use of force must be adjusted, through a process of conflict and contestation, cooperation and growth.¹² However, despite this growing international concern, international law of armed conflict (LOAC) has yet to develop an adequate fitted model. In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey G.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

A/RES/67/27, at 2 (Dec. 3, 2012).\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber warfare,\"and\"cyber operation.\"This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n## I. DEFINITIONS The literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as\"cyberattack,\"\"cyber operation,\"and\"cyber ¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] warfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³ The most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵ Despite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³ In respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] For clarity and simplicity, this Article adopts the definition of the Tallinn Manual for cyberattack, noting the existing controversies and varying interpretations.³⁷ ## II. LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE Oona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹ Due to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nSecondly, unlike kinetic war, cyber operations may cause serious damage to critical infrastructure without causing any physical damage;51 operations within cyberspace may cause severe non-physical damage, including the destruction of banking systems and computers, harm of sensitive information and data, damage to government digital networks, and disruption of essential governmental services.52 Although these effects are all severe, they are not physical. For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55 Thirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] delays in accurate attribution.57 Cyber operations are frequently harder to identify and assess than conventional kinetic attacks. Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59 Fourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61 Finally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64 ## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE The initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nIn 2004, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) was founded by the United Nations and has held five sessions to date.74 Three of the sessions are considered to be successful in “outlining the global cybersecurity agenda and introducing the applicability of international law to state behaviour in cyberspace.”75 As explained by Eneken Tikk-Ringas, the first session (2004/2005) was unsuccessful in producing a report, due to lack of consensus.76 The second GGE session (2009/2010) aimed to continue studying the current and emerging information security threats and ways to resolve them.77 This session started the discussion among states regarding standards of use related to information and communication technology (ICT).78 Tikk-Ringas continues her explanation by stating that the third GGE session (2012/2013) focused on states’ behaviour and expanded the discussion into two separate dialogues: “applicability of international law [to ICT] and norms of responsible state behaviour.”79 Prior to the third session, in 2011, Russia, China, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan offered an “International VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] code of conduct for information security.”80 Moreover, the third session was notable because Russia and China, for the first time, publicly stated that “international law is applicable to cyberspace.”81 The fourth GGE session (2014/2015) dealt with “norms, rules, and principles for the responsible behaviour of States (chapter 3) separately from how international law applies to the use of ICTs (chapter 6).”82 The former was considered to be “voluntary, non-binding norms” that do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law.”83 The United States used the fourth GGE session to verify “existing principles of international law… identify and analyze rules and norms of behaviour that should govern the use of cyberspace.”84 The report of the fourth session “relates to the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter and affirms the IHL [international humanitarian law] principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction.”85 This session was significant and invited experts from many UN Member States, including “Belarus, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States.”86 The consequent reports of those sessions reflect some of the points on which consensus was achieved between the Member States.87 Opposed to these three successful sessions, “the fifth and…last session” so far (2017) failed as a result of “fundamental disagreements” between the 25 members of the GGE group.88 Therefore, this session, similar to the first one, also did not produce a consensus report.89 The UN activities mentioned above and the resolutions that have been adopted over time by different committees show that international cyber norms are slowly emerging, even though this process is highly dynamic.90\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## A. The Tallinn Manual Project\nIn addition to the UN activities, in 2013 an international group of experts (“the Tallinn Group”) created the *Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* that was initiated and supported by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE).97 The purpose of the *Manual* was to create “a non-binding document applying the existing law to cyber warfare.”98 The international processes, including the *Tallinn Manual* projects, have focused on the application of LOAC to the actual challenges and circumstances of cyber warfare.99 This includes the application of customary international law (CIL),100 treaty law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949,101 the Additional Protocols of\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] 1977,¹⁰² and The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,¹⁰³ as well as the UN Charter.¹⁰⁴ Despite the international efforts described above and the significant development with the Tallinn Manuals, attempts to create binding international law applicable to cyber warfare have been unsuccessful.\nAdditionally, while the Tallinn process and manuals provide useful commentary on the application of existing international law to cyber operations, this interpretation is not universally accepted, and several significant issues remain highly contested (as will be detailed in sub-sections B through F below).¹⁰⁵ Indeed, most scholars agree that “international law applies to cyber warfare.”¹⁰⁶ For example, the UN Secretary-General has acknowledged that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable [to cyberwarfare].”¹⁰⁷ Likewise, Harold Koh, legal advisor to the U.S. Department of State, “has stated that international law does apply to activities in cyberspace.”¹⁰⁸ Finally, the Tallinn Group unanimously concluded that “both the jus ad bellum and jus in bello apply to cyber operations.”¹⁰⁹ However, some of the issues raised by cyberattacks are not clearly addressed by existing international law.¹¹⁰ This gap is\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAccordingly, while many of the current treaties and agreements under international law apply to cyberattacks, they do not do so explicitly.¹¹³ The UN Charter, for example, offers a legal framework for an international convention regulating cyber operations, yet it seems that it is unable to address all the complexities involved in such a war.¹¹⁴ In his Article, Schmitt identifies seven key grey zones concerning the application of international law to cyber warfare, including sovereignty, use of force, self-defence, and attribution.¹¹⁵ This Article adopts and discusses these seven grey zones, as well as countermeasures. Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention The first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] state’s sovereignty.”120 For example, as posited by Michael Schmitt, State A has three alternatives to oversee cyber operations conducted by State B: i) using servers in State A’s own territory to capture and intercept signals; ii) inserting malware into State B’s network remotely; or iii) using a hard drive to implant the malware.121 Schmitt analyses these three alternatives, and he begins by stating that the first alternative does not raise any legal issues because it neither involves coercion nor causes any physical injury. Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126 With regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## C. Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n---\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nReese Nguyen explains that the target-based approach is based on the entity being targeted; for example, an attack on critical infrastructure, such as important “systems and assets,” can be considered a use of force.¹⁵⁶ This approach focuses on “critical infrastructure with special status”¹⁵⁷ and defines “any cyber operation against such infrastructure as an ‘armed attack.’”¹⁵⁸ This approach is itself limited though, especially since different countries may have different definitions of “critical infrastructure.”¹⁵⁹ For instance, the US Congress defines critical infrastructure as “systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹⁶⁰ Second, while the previous approach was criticized for being under-inclusive, scholars argue that the target-based approach is “over-inclusive” as it extends the chances that a cyber operation might be considered as use of force.¹⁶¹ This might undermine international security by increasing the likelihood of war.¹⁶² According to this approach, it is sufficient that a cyber operation would merely attack a highly important infrastructure of a state in order to be considered as a use of force justifying self-defence as a response.¹⁶³ For example, under this approach, Iran should have been allowed to respond with force to the Stuxnet operation.¹⁶⁴ Similarly, the cyber operations against Estonia should have been considered a use of force, even though not much damage was done.¹⁶⁵ VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] Next, with regard to the second question of self-defence, according to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), “not every use of force rises to the level of armed attack.”166 It is essential to understand the difference between a use of force and an armed attack as the former seeks to “determine whether a state has violated Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and the related customary international law prohibition,”167 while the latter determines “whether the target state may respond to an act with a use of force without itself violating the prohibition on using force.”168 “Only in the event that the use of force reaches the threshold of an armed attack, is a state entitled to respond using force in self-defence.”169 Thus, it is necessary to consider the “scale and effects” of a cyber operation in order to determine whether it reaches the level of an armed attack.170 The “scale and effects” criteria were introduced in the ICJ Nicaragua judgment to differentiate actions that are considered armed attacks and actions that are not.171 The ICJ “distinguish[es] the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms but provided no further guidance in this regard.”172 Therefore, the dispute regarding the “scale and effects” criteria is still unresolved.173 The Tallinn Group agreed that “any use of force that injures or kills persons or damages or destroys property would satisfy the scale and effects requirement” to be considered as an armed attack.174 However, they did not reach a consensus on the exact point of the severity of injury and damage in terms of how much harm a cyber operation needs to cause to people or property in order to qualify as an armed attack.175 In fact, the international community has never managed to unambiguously identify any international cyber operations approaching the level of an armed attack, including incidents such as the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.176 The Tallinn Group\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAdditionally, the Tallinn Manual brings to light some more issues that remain unsettled with regards to cyber operations that trigger the legal right to self-defence. First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what Why States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L. REV. 1023, 1024-25 (2007); Nguyen, supra note 140, at 1127.\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] matters - only cyber operations that harm people or cause physical damage to property should be considered armed attacks; others focused on the extent of the consequences, as illustrated by the example of an “incident directed against the New York Stock Exchange that causes the market to crash.”187 As such a scenario may cause no more than economic damage, it was controversial among the Tallinn Group experts.188 Finally, the last unsettled issue relates to the effects of the cyber operation.189 The Tallinn Group “agreed that all reasonably foreseeable consequences” should be considered in order to qualify a certain cyber operation as an armed attack.190 For example, cyber operations “targeting a water purification plant” should be considered as an armed attack as their effects are reasonably expected - people can become very ill or even die as a result of “drinking contaminated water.”191 Yet, the Tallinn Group did not reach a consensus as to whether these effects need to be intentional. For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193 In summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nD. Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹ LOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵ The Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷ The Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] cyber incidents that reach the level of an “attack” can be regulated under LOAC Rules.²¹² With regards to non-international armed conflicts, the Manual defines them as “protracted armed violence, which may include or be limited to cyber operations [between certain armed groups]” (Rule 23).²¹³ The Manual also mentions that LOAC can apply only if the conflict reaches a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict, such as “individual... or groups of hackers,” show a “minimum degree of organization.”²¹⁴ This means that “cyber operations in and of themselves will only in exceptional cases amount to non-international armed conflict.”²¹⁵ One of the main challenges with *jus in bello* is applying LOAC “principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution” to cyber operations.²¹⁶ These principles are “codified in the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) [²¹⁷ and]… customary international law [and are] applicable both in international and non-international armed conflicts.”²¹⁸ The principle of distinction limits the legitimate targets only to “combatants or military objects” in order to protect civilians.²¹⁹ However, cyberspace is a domain being used by both the army and the civilian population, which makes distinction much more challenging,²²⁰ yet still possible, as in the case of Stuxnet. Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system. However, attacks\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nAnother critical question, posed by Yohannes Eneyew Ayalew, concerns the personnel who usually conduct cyber operations, namely hackers: “[a]re [they] a legitimate target?”²²⁴ Are they protected under LOAC? Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵ The second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] that could be achieved, but evaluating this proportionality in cyberspace is even harder due to the “interconnected nature of cyberspace.”234 Another important principle is precaution. LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238 It is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243 In summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## E. Countermeasures\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] rare. As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶ Appealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶² Thus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## F. Due Diligence\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n## G. State Responsibility for Cyber Operations and the Legal Standard for Attribution\nIn addition to the grey zones in the interpretation of the relevant legal rules, cyber operations often raise problems relating to identifying the responsible actors. As Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne articulate, this\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] issue of responsibility and attribution is divided between technical and legal characteristics.274 The\"technical problem\"is to pinpoint the source of a specific cyber operation.275 The\"legal problem\"is to determine the criteria for faulting a state for cyber operations\"by nonstate actors.\"276 The main reason for these problems, as articulated by Efrony and Shany, is that cyberspace possesses distinct features, such as providing a platform for people to act clandestinely.277 The possibility to conduct cyber operations clandestinely relying on capabilities to hide IP addresses, as well as the reliance on\"hacker groups or 'hacktivists'\"rather than formal state institutions, generates these issues.278 However, in order to attribute responsibility, it is necessary to identify the physical computers and devices used by the attacker and identify the state responsible for that attacker.279 A victim state could legally respond to an attack only after identifying these details.280 Beyond these factual challenges, the legal standard of attributing cyber operations to states is also challenging. Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for\"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\"if it is\"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also,\"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless,\"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283 Literature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nUnited States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua... would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.²⁸⁹ Accordingly, effective control, as articulated in Nicaragua, means that the State must have either “directed or enforced” the specific unlawful operations.²⁹⁰ In the Tadic case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted the overall control standard, which is more tolerant and provides that a state can be responsible for an operation conducted by a certain group (or individual), which was endorsed by a state.²⁹¹ The effective control test is problematic when applied to cyberspace due to the high level of proof that is unlikely to be achieved given the difficult task VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of identifying the origin of a cyber operation.²⁹² Further, even the tolerant overall control standard has been criticized as unrealistic when it comes to the attribution of cyber operations.²⁹³ This is because attributing a cyber operation to a certain state depends on the ability to prove the extent of the involvement of a state, such as if a state “direct[ed] private individuals or groups to conduct the operations.”²⁹⁴ This kind of proof is also hard to achieve as cyber operations can be carried out by non-state actors without expending a large amount of funds and with different technology than States.²⁹⁵ Thus, attributing an action of a non-state actor to a state might be very difficult.²⁹⁶ Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that it is still unknown whether the Russian Federation was in some way involved in the “2007 cyber operations” against Estonia that were partially conducted by a hacking group named the Nashi youth.²⁹⁷ The Tallinn Group noted that, “[i]nternational law regulates cyber operations by non-State actors [that are not attributed to a State] only in limited cases.”(Rule 33).²⁹⁸ First, it applies Article 11 of the Articles of State Responsibility, providing that a state is allowed to acknowledge a cyber operation conducted by a non-state actor as its own conduct.²⁹⁹ The Tallinn Group further stated that “cyber operations conducted by non-State actors that are not attributable to States” cannot breach international law rules, such as the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention and cannot be considered as use of force. Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³ To summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## H. Summary\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] defence.³¹⁴ The third unsettled issue is whether cyber operations that are conducted independently by non-state actors are thus armed attacks which would justify a state acting in self-defence.³¹⁵ Another unsettled issue concerns actions that do not cause “injury, death, damage or destruction” but result in “negative effects.”³¹⁶ The last question, which relates to the issue of “reasonably foreseeable consequences,” is if the perpetrator’s intent in regard to the outcome of a cyber operation matters.³¹⁷ Under the grey zone of LOAC, there were four questions provided by Ayalew and Diamond, deriving from the application of the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution. The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹ With regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²² The due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵ Supporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\n## IV. LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] “supreme judicial authority” leads to divergence in the application of LOAC norms to specific cases and to unresolved legal disputes.³³⁶ Another aspect of legal cynicism is the servitude to powerful states’ interests and agendas.³³⁷ For example, Jochen von Bernstorff argues that there has been a recurring trend in the development of LOAC to prohibit weapons during “future armed conflicts” that have lost their relevance and effectiveness.³³⁸ Bernstorff also posits the example of suspending the use of weapons that “are not yet ready to be used for military purposes” or weapons that are no longer effective to use in warfare because of other military innovations.³³⁹ Despite the fact that such restrictions have no appreciable humanitarian effects, powerful states may present them as a significant achievement.³⁴⁰ In contrast, relevant weapons, such as those used for cyber operations, would have no restrictions imposed on them or only the governments that are unable to use them would limit them (similar to the nuclear weapons regime).³⁴¹ To demonstrate this legal cynicism when adapting international law to cyberspace, this section focuses on the grey zone of use of force under jus ad bellum.³⁴² First, it is important to examine the legal perspectives of Israel, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and France concerning the applicability of use of force to cyber operations.³⁴³ The analysis of the positions of these states demonstrates two significant aspects of legal cynicism: (i) a degree of uncertainty concerning the legal rules, based on different interpretations of relevant countries in their application of the legal rules;³⁴⁴ and (ii) expressions of legal interpretations that are consistent with, and reflecting of, states’ political and military interests.³⁴⁵\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349 Second, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] of force.”353 Thus, when using these criteria to analyse the Stuxnet incident and considering the positions of states regarding use of force, it should have been expected that states – in particular those proposing “physical damage” as the main attribute of a cyberattack – would conclude that this operation crosses the level of use of force and violates “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.”354 However, in practice, even after more than 10 years since that incident, states are disinclined to classify the Stuxnet attack as illegal use of force;355 there is a complete silence regarding this issue as no state has condemned or supported this operation. Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage. The failure of the international community to condemn the Stuxnet attack as a breach of\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] illustrates the ambiguity of international law and constructs it as non-juridical and cynical.\nIn summary, legal grey zones relating to cyber warfare intensify elements of legal cynicism in the law of armed conflict in several ways. First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n## CONCLUSION Despite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n\n2023] MIND THE GAP(S)\n\nVIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [63:2] * * *"

First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373 In addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.",

    "ARTICLE\n\n# Mind the Gap(s) – The Need to Resolve Uncertainties in the International Law of Cyber Warfare\n\nSHIRAN SHAHAF*\n\nEmerging evidence demonstrates the growing significance of cyber operations in the context of armed conflicts and aggression. Despite increasing concerns of the international community, no specialised international legal regime has been developed to govern and control these operations. Instead, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) is applied to cyber operations that are conducted during armed conflicts. While the implementation of LOAC to evaluate the legality of cyber operations is important and valuable, this branch of law has not yet developed enough to resolve several core legal issues that are at the heart of cyber operations. These legal uncertainties, gaps and unsettled issues, have been referred to in the literature as \"grey zones.\" Existing studies questioned whether clarifying these grey zones is desirable, given the uniqueness and sensitivities of cyber operations. This Article first identifies and analyses the main grey zones in the application of LOAC on cyber operations. It then focuses on the question of whether these gaps and uncertainties should be clarified, placing this Article in a growing conversation about legal cynicism and the politicization of international law. In particular, it argues that these gaps contribute to the marginalization of international law and frustrate its role in guiding human behaviour during armed conflicts.\n\n* PhD candidate, Deakin University Faculty of Business and law; MA in European Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; BA in International Relations and Arabic Language and Literature, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

    "2023]\nMIND THE GAP(S)\n211\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 2010, the Iranian nuclear systems were penetrated by the “Stuxnet” worm. This computer worm caused serious and irreversible physical “damage to the uranium-enriching infrastructure at the Natanz nuclear facility” and interfered with its processes.¹ The Stuxnet incident, allegedly conducted by state actors,² physically abused another state’s infrastructure, thus illustrating the growing relevance of cyber warfare capabilities, the new risks to national security posed by cyberspace,³ and mainly the need for international legal rules to regulate cyber operations.⁴\n\nThe Stuxnet incident is not an isolated event. A new era has begun, one in which ongoing global technology changes are occurring.⁵ “More than 2.7 billion people use the internet” worldwide, and the majority of developed states use computers and computer networks to manage their national infrastructures.⁶ The global technological change and the rise of cyberspace throughout the last few decades have had a substantial impact on states’ security concerns, and national cybersecurity has become a highly important issue in states’ “foreign and domestic policies.”⁷ All states are vulnerable to cyber operations: those that are technologically advanced, as well as those that lack technological development.⁸ Thus, concerns regarding the ability to hinder or de-escalate cyber operations have been expressed by the international community.⁹ For example, “the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly has acknowledged that cyberattacks put the peace and security of the world at risk and have the capacity to undermine the security and integrity of critical national infrastructures, which provide services in the civil and military domains.”¹⁰ Also, the United States government has\n\n1.

In the past two decades, extensive scholarship in international law has analysed the rules governing cyber warfare, and, in particular, the application of the traditional law of armed conflict to cyber operations. Yet, not all the rules of international law apply flawlessly to cyber operations due to a poor match between existing rules and the challenges of cyber. Furthermore, some of the applicable rules generate significant legal disagreements and unsettled issues.¹³ In 2017, Michael Schmitt published an Article in which he discussed some of these unsettled issues, which he termed “grey zones.”¹⁴ Schmitt highlighted three reasons justifying the need for clarification of these grey zones: First, “uncertainty can lead to escalation” as states may interpret and respond to certain actions differently.¹⁵ Second, “clarification of grey zone issues will also enhance deterrence in cyberspace.”¹⁶ Third, “legal clarity breeds international stability,” and the clarification of grey zones can reduce the likelihood that states will use them in a way that leads to instability.¹⁷ While accepting Schmitt’s general arguments for clarifying grey zones in international law governing cyber operations, this Article advances a fourth argument for clarification, placing the implications of “grey zones” in the emerging debate about cynicism and backlash in international law. Existing literature identifies legal cynicism as a prevalent problem in international law and, specifically, in the law of armed conflict.¹⁸ Based on this literature, I argue that existing legal grey zones trigger cynical attitudes towards international law and make people less trusting of it. Further, these grey\n\nG.A. Res. 63/37, U.N. Doc. A/RES/63/37, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2008); G.A. Res. 64/25, U.N. Doc. A/RES/64/25, at 2 (Dec. 2, 2009); G.A. Res. 65/41, U.N. Doc.

This legal ambiguity, also known as \"grey zones\" by Schmitt, will enable states to use international law as a tool to justify their actions.\n\nHence, the main questions this article seeks to clarify are: what are the current grey zones and controversies concerning the legal regime governing cyber operations? And, how do these gaps contribute to the marginalization and politicization of international law? This Article begins in Section I with definitions of key terms, including \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber warfare,\" and \"cyber operation.\" This Article only covers cyber operations governed under the law of war, namely *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, although there could be other laws, international or domestic, governing cyber operations. Cyber operations conducted outside these two branches of law are not covered in this Article. Section II then identifies core differences between cyber operations and other types of armed conflicts. These differences are the basis for identification of existing grey zones discussed in Section III. Section III begins with a description of the international efforts invested to regulate cyber operations, including the *Tallinn Manual*, and shows that despite these efforts, cyber warfare is currently not sufficiently regulated by existing legal norms. Then, based on the accepted notion that international law of war generally applies to cyber operations, Section III identifies the existing grey zones - legal gaps and unsettled issues - deriving from the application of international law to cyber operations. This Article extends and expands upon Schmitt's pioneering work in several ways.¹⁹ First, it updates and enhances our understanding of the grey zones, for example by identifying countermeasures, which are not yet addressed by existing literature. Second, it provides an updated analysis of existing core disagreements, including those relating to the use of force and self-defence. Finally, by adopting the arguments of legal cynicism, Section IV demonstrates that the clarification of grey zones, as articulated by Michael Schmitt, in cyberspace is needed not only to prevent misinterpretation of the law or to promote international stability, but also to strengthen and reclaim international law as a normative framework guiding behaviour during armed conflicts.\n\n## I. DEFINITIONS\n\nThe literature on this topic utilises different concepts and definitions of cyber tools and methods, resulting in confusion concerning the scope and meaning of core terms such as \"cyberattack,\" \"cyber operation,\" and \"cyber\n\n¹⁹. Schmitt, *supra* note 14.",
    "VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[63:2]\n\nwarfare.”²⁰ In addition to detailed legal definitions, some authors use these terms colloquially, broadly signifying any use of cyber means in various contexts.²¹ For purposes of clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “cyberattack,” as defined below, as its core term used to reference the cyber equivalent to the traditional “armed attack” concept. The term “cyber operation” is defined as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace.”²² The term “cyber warfare” is used to refer more broadly to any cyber operation that occurs during an armed conflict, regardless of whether the operation can be considered as an armed attack or not; the term “cyber warfare” includes both cyberattacks and cyber operations.²³\n\nThe most important definition central to this Article is the definition of “cyberattack,” which refers to a cyber operation that according to *jus ad bellum*, crosses the line of an armed attack. Within *jus in bello*, LOAC applies to cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict (which do not necessarily rise to the level of cyberattack).²⁴ The traditional distinction between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* also applies to cyberspace.²⁵\n\nDespite the significance of the term “cyberattacks” for the application of LOAC, existing literature includes various inconsistent definitions of this term. Analysing these definitions in the existing literature (including when referred to as “cyber warfare”), this Article identifies four main elements that are included in most definitions: (i) the identity of the attacker (state or non-state actor); (ii) the means of the operation (computer system or network); (iii) the target of the operation (computer system or network); and (iv) the effects of the operation (physical damage, reasonably expected such damage or damage caused to the functionality of physical objects).²⁶ Among the existing legal definitions, there is a consensus, articulated by Charles G. Billo and Welton Chang, that the *means* of the operation must be computers,\n\n20. See, e.g., Kilovaty, *supra* note 1, at 92; Hathaway et al., *supra* note 4, at 826–37; Arie J.

The first controversy refers to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors, asking whether they are considered “cyberattacks” under the law of armed conflict.²⁹ The second controversy concerns whether an operation must result in physical damage in order to be considered a cyberattack, or whether physical damage that was reasonably expected is sufficient, even if the actual outcomes of the attack did not have such effect.³⁰\n\nThe most comprehensive legal document which defines “cyberattack” is the Tallinn Manual.³¹ The Tallinn Manual (Rule 30) defines a cyberattack as a “cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”³² In relation to the identity of the attacker, the Tallinn Manual mentions that “in special circumstances, the conduct of non-state actors may be attributable to a state” (Rule 6).³³\n\nIn respect to the effects of the operation, the Tallinn Manual takes the view that actual physical damage is not required, as long as it falls within the definition of a cyberattack mentioned above.³⁴ It further clarified that the word “cause” refers to “any reasonable foreseeable consequential damage, destruction, injury or death,”³⁵ and not only to the “effects on the targeted cyber system.”³⁶\n\n27.

LEGAL CHALLENGES RELATING TO CYBERSPACE\n\nOona Hathaway writes that the typical areas of warfare include land, air, sea, and space; however, she notes that the increasing weaponization of the cyber world has led to the acknowledgement that cyberspace is another important aspect of warfare.³⁸ However, “[t]he definition of cyberspace proposed by the [United States] National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [is] ‘a domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.’”³⁹\n\nDue to its distinctive features, cyberspace is different from the conventional, physical-kinetic sphere.⁴⁰ Firstly, cyber operations are actions conducted via the internet.⁴¹ Due to technological advancements, states heavily rely on computers and digital networks to manage their “critical infrastructure.”⁴² Governments (and societies more broadly) are highly dependent on infrastructure which generally consists of essential services, including those related to communications, funds and so forth.⁴³ Vulnerability within these infrastructures exposes states to the risk of massive damage if these systems are interrupted.⁴⁴ Moreover, the internet does not have an organized structure,⁴⁵ which means that there is no clear separation between military and civilian networks and infrastructures; they are inherently interconnected and difficult to distinguish.⁴⁶ In other words, military codes sent through cyberspace are divided up into several data packages and may be sent through various civilian routes, and pass through\n\n37.

For example, unlike Stuxnet which resulted in physical damage, most cyber operations had serious effects but caused no physical destruction, such as the cyber operations on Estonia in 2007 and on Georgia in 2008.53 The difference between physical and non-physical damage is highly significant in terms of applying the law; for example, as Russell Buchan has argued, “Article 2(4) [of the Charter of the United Nations (“UN Charter”)] is an effects-based prohibition,” meaning that only cyber operations that cause “physical damage will be regarded as an unlawful use of force.”54 Thus, cyber operations that do not reach this level will not constitute a violation of Article 2(4).55\n\nThirdly, a key problem relating to cyber operations is identifying where the attack is coming from and who is responsible for it.56 Not only are cyber operations usually conducted clandestinely, but cyber attackers can also use technology to create false identifiers, which could cause confusion and\n\n47.

Such an analysis might call for the use of sensitive technology capabilities and information that states would rather keep secret. As a result, it is more difficult to attribute cyber operations.58 Lorraine Finley and Christian Payne articulate that these technical difficulties have legal consequences: a state might misattribute a cyber operation and accidentally use self-defence to attack the wrong third party. Also, because it takes time to identify the attacker, a state might not satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity which are needed to legitimately use self-defence.59\n\nFourthly, unlike physical attacks, cyberspace actions are immediate. For cyber operations, no physical arrangements or deployments, such as military forces, are necessary.60 Likewise, cyber operations can occur instantaneously, as they do not have the geographical distance barrier.61\n\nFinally, while in the past states had exclusive use of weaponry and military facilities, cyber methods are easily reachable.62 No one has exclusive control over cyberspace, thus both states and non-state actors can utilise it to further their ends.63 For example, weak states or non-state actors who could not afford significant military expenses to participate in kinetic armed attacks may have the capability to do so now, by more affordable and quicker means.64\n\n## III. APPLYING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO CYBER WARFARE\n\nThe initial international step to regulate cyber warfare was the United Nations General Assembly First Committee (1998).65 The Russian Federation initiated a call for “a cyber arms-control treaty” while the position of the United States was that “the same laws that apply to the use of kinetic weapons should apply to state behaviour in cyberspace.”66 This Committee has produced a draft resolution that was adopted as Resolution\n\n57.

Also, under the grey zone of “use of force,” this Article discusses the three approaches scholars have previously suggested to evaluate legitimacy of use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹¹⁶ In addition, under the grey zone of “self-defence,” this Article identifies two more unsettled issues, and under the grey zone of “LOAC” it identifies one more unsettled issue. The following sections describe these main grey zones and emphasize the difficulty in applying the LOAC to cyber operations through the examples of both the 2010 Stuxnet incident against Iran and the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n\n## B. Sovereignty and Non-intervention\n\nThe first challenge is applying the principles of state sovereignty¹¹⁷ and non-intervention¹¹⁸ to cyber operations. Under the principle of sovereignty, “hostile cyber operations directed against cyber infrastructure located on another state’s territory… constitute, inter alia, a violation of that state’s sovereignty whenever they cause physical damage or injury.”¹¹⁹ Thus, the unsolved question is regarding “cyber operations that neither cause physical damage nor amount to an intervention nevertheless violate the targeted\n\n111.

Also, espionage is not forbidden under international law.122 After analysing the first, Schmitt moves to the third alternative, stating that it would be considered a breach of State B’s sovereignty because the operation is taking place on its territory without States B’s permission.123 Schmitt concludes with an analysis of the second alternative, which he reminds us remains controversial: “[d]oes the remote implantation of the malware into State B’s cyber systems… violate State B’s sovereignty?”124 Schmitt states that the Tallinn Group could not agree on whether it is considered a violation of sovereignty when a malware is implanted in a territory of another state and does not cause any physical damage.125 Also, while traditionally only actions conducted by states could be considered as a violation of sovereignty, “some scholars [argue] that cyber operations conducted by non-State actors may also violate a state’s sovereignty.”126\n\nWith regards to the grey zone of non-intervention, “international law prohibits external intervention in the domestic affairs of another state due to the protective principles of territorial sovereignty and sovereign equality.”127 An action does not need to “cause physical damage or injury” in order to be considered as a violation of non-intervention principle, but it needs a coercive intent.128 Coercion means taking actions in order to deny the free choice from another state.129 The Tallinn Group agreed that cyber operations aimed at coercing the government may be considered as “a prohibited ‘intervention’” or even “prohibited ‘use of force.’”130 Further, an\n\n120.

Jus ad Bellum: Use of Force, Armed Attack, and Self Defence\n\n*Jus ad bellum* determines whether resorting to force is legal. Core questions under *jus ad bellum* are: (i) “when does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law?”¹³³ and (ii) “when would a cyber-attack rise to the level of an armed attack justifying self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter?”¹³⁴\n\nWith regard to the first question, it is agreed that “a cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force” (*Tallinn Manual*, Rule 11).¹³⁵ The Tallinn Group reached consensus on the point that cyber operations resulting in physical damage, such as damage to computer hardware, can be comparable to kinetic operations in its scale and effects and considered as use of force.¹³⁶ However, they did not reach a similar consensus concerning cyber operations that lack physical consequences.¹³⁷ Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany identify that this “lack of consensus…under *jus ad bellum*” is a major inadequacy of the *Tallinn Manuals*.¹³⁸\n\nAs stated by Oona Hathaway, the literature on this topic discusses three different approaches to analyse use of force: the effect-based, the instrument-based, and the target-based approaches.¹³⁹ As will be demonstrated below, and as articulated by Reese Nguyen, each of these\n\n---\n\n¹³¹. *Id.*\n\n¹³².

While Schmitt states that according to the criteria these cyber operations can be considered as use of force because they were severe, invasive, and unnecessary, and also their effects were immediate, direct, and difficult to quantify,¹⁴⁶ other scholars interpreted this case contrarily. These scholars argue that while the cyber operations against Estonia were indeed immediate, the consequences were minimal: they were not extremely serious due to the fact that there was no physical harm or damage to property, and the disruption caused merely a temporary inconvenience in terms of access to websites.¹⁴⁷ According to these scholars, the attack was intrusive and illegal, yet the ultimate consequences could not be considered a use of force.¹⁴⁸ Despite its weaknesses and even though it needs further refinement and broader consent in assessing use of force, the effect-based approach appears the most practicable approach when it comes to cyber operations.¹⁴⁹\n\nThe instrument-based approach focuses on the way cyber operations are conducted.¹⁵⁰ Under this approach, only use of conventional weapons is relevant in order to qualify a cyber operation as use of force.¹⁵¹ The main problem with this approach is that cyber operations normally do not employ ordinary military equipment and weapons and do not have the physical\n\n140.

First, it is not clear whether a state can legally respond to several cyber operations that, if carried out separately, would not qualify as an armed attack.179 The Tallin Group inquired as to whether these cyber operations could be considered an armed attack when accumulated.180 The Tallinn Group agreed that these small operations can be considered as a complex armed attack if they are related to each other, they were carried out by “the same originator,” and they reached a necessary scale when combined.181 The second unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that are carried out by non-state actors. It was agreed by the Tallinn Group that such operations, conducted by either individuals or group of people, may qualify as an armed attack if they are attributed to a state or under its guidance.182 However, it remains controversial whether cyber operations that were carried out by non-state actors without any guidance of a state can be considered as an armed attack and justify a response of self-defence.183 Most of the Tallinn Group experts concluded that States have the “right of self-defence... [against] armed attacks by non-State actors, such as terrorists and rebel groups,” and extended this right to cyber operations also; only a few experts of the Tallinn Group thought otherwise.184 For example, even though they were carried out by a non-state actor, the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda against the United States were classified “as an armed attack triggering the inherent right to self-defence.”185 The third unsettled issue relates to cyber operations that result in extensive and adverse consequences without causing any injury, death, damage or destruction.186 Some of the Tallinn Group experts argued that the nature of the consequences is what\n\nWhy States Need an International Law for Information Operations, 11 LEWIS &amp; CLARK L.

For example, they provided the example of “cyber espionage by State A against State B that unexpectedly results in significant damage to State B’s cyber infrastructure.”192 Most of the Group argued that “intention is irrelevant in qualifying an operation as an armed attack and that only the scale and effects matter.”193\n\nIn summary, jus ad bellum refers to situations in which states are permitted to use force.194 Due to several disagreements concerning jus ad bellum issues in the cyber field, the current norms are insufficient and do not provide States clear guidelines regarding the prohibition to use force and the right to self-defence.195 First, in relation to the use of force issue, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group regarding cyber operations that lack physical consequences. Second, there are some disagreements under the issue of self-defense; a consensus could not be reached as for the damage that might be caused to people or property when determining the scale and effects.196 Also, there was no consensus amongst the Tallinn Group as to whether some specific scenarios justify self-defense as a response, such as (i) scenarios in which non-state actors, rather than states, carry out cyber operations,197 and (ii) scenarios in which cyber operations resulted in serious effects, but do not harm people or property.198 Thus, the literature has\n\n187.

Jus in bello: The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)²⁰¹\n\nLOAC refers to cyber operations performed during an armed conflict.²⁰² The controversy is “whether cyber operations themselves can trigger an armed conflict and thereby bring LOAC into operation.”²⁰³ The Tallinn Manual takes a supportive stance regarding international armed conflicts, but adopts a more subtle stance with regards to non-international armed conflicts.²⁰⁴ Etian Diamond explains that “international armed conflicts” involve two or more States, while “non-international armed conflicts” require that “at least one of the belligerent parties is a non-state actor.”²⁰⁵\n\nThe Tallinn Manual defines international armed conflicts as “[inter-state] hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations” (Rule 22).²⁰⁶ This means that LOAC can apply to cyber operations that reach the level of “hostilities.”²⁰⁷\n\nThe Manual provides that “hostilities may involve any combination of kinetic and cyber operations, or cyber operations alone.”²⁰⁸ Further, “hostilities exist whenever one state engages in ‘cyber attacks’ (Rule 30) against another.”²⁰⁹ Rain Liivoja and Tim McCormack analyse, “whether, and if so what kind of, cyber operations falling below the intensity of an attack could nonetheless trigger an armed conflict.”²¹⁰ Little direction could be found in the Manual regarding this matter.²¹¹ Accordingly, it seems that the only\n\n199.

Further, “most international cyber infrastructure[s are]…in practice…dual-use infrastructure[s]” that serve both military and civilian needs, such as “computers, routers, cables, and satellites.”²²¹ Therefore, the most important concern regarding this matter is whether it is possible to guarantee that cyber operations are focused solely on military goals and that ongoing precautionary measures are implemented to protect “civilian infrastructure.”²²² The Stuxnet virus is an example of a cyberattack against a particular military computer system.

Since many of them are civilians, the LOAC should, in principle, defend them from hostile attacks. However, some scholars argue that there is no justification to protect hackers that participate in a cyber-attack.²²⁵\n\nThe second principle is proportionality. Under this principle, attacks are not allowed if they “may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”²²⁶ This principle tries to reduce the harm that can be done to material items and civilians while yet achieving the “military advantage gained from the attack.”²²⁷ There is a real threat that cyber operations would have a severe impact on civilian facilities, given the “dual-use nature of most cyber infrastructure” and the “interconnectedness of cyberspace.”²²⁸ A central challenge of practicing proportionality in cyber operations is assessing whether “damage” also includes in its definition “loss of functionality.”²²⁹ This issue of whether “loss of functionality” is considered as damage was discussed among the Tallinn Group experts.²³⁰ Most of the group argued “that interference with functionality qualifies as damage if restoration of functionality requires replacement of physical components.”²³¹ Schmitt provides the example of a cyber operation that halts the functioning of an electrical grid and necessitates a replacement of critical parts of the system.²³² The second unresolved issue in this regard is determining whether any unintended civilian harm might be disproportional when taking into account the military benefit.²³³ In fact, Diamond emphasizes that it is never easy to accurately evaluate and foresee the damage that might be caused to civilians compared to the military advantage\n\n223.

LOAC “requires belligerents to take precautions in attack,”235 as well as precautions against the effects of attack.”236 While combatants may be obligated to take all reasonable steps to keep their military and civilian cyber systems distinct, the integrated nature of military and civilian cyber systems makes this extremely unlikely.237 Therefore, applying the precaution principle to cyber operations is also complicated due to technical challenges.238\n\nIt is important to also mention cyber operations occurring outside of an armed conflict. LOAC applies only to cyber operations conducted “during armed conflict,” thus, cyber operations conducted “outside the context of armed conflict”, which are not covered by LOAC, may fall under other laws.239 While the first Tallinn Manual only addressed jus ad bellum and jus in bello, “Tallinn Manual 2.0 [also] examines key aspects of the public international law governing ‘cyber operations’ during peacetime.”240 It “does not deal with international criminal law, trade law or intellectual property...[n]or ...with either private international law or domestic law,” but it does relate to “other public international law regimes.”241 For example, Rule 32 relates to “[p]eacetime cyber espionage.”242 The Tallinn Group agreed that “[a]lthough peacetime cyber espionage by States does not per se violate international law,” cyber espionage that, for example, “violate[s] the international human right to privacy” is illegal.243\n\nIn summary, while LOAC generally applies to cyber operations conducted during armed conflict (international and non-international), the application of its principles presents several difficulties, mostly due to the cyber world’s “interconnected nature.”244 First, since “international cyber infrastructures” are “dual-use” (military and civilian) applying the principle of distinction becomes challenging as it necessitates differentiating\n\n234.

This principle requires taking into account the expected damage to civilians while achieving military advantage from the operation. Again, since “cyber infrastructures” may be “dual-use,” it is difficult to assess whether the expected damage might be disproportionate and harm also civilians.²⁴⁷ Lastly, precaution is also difficult to apply since cyberspace is interconnected, and it is hard to distinguish infrastructures used by the military and civilians.²⁴⁸ Regarding cyber operations to which LOAC does not apply, we can find cyber operations conducted outside armed conflict or non-international cyber operations in which the involved party cannot prove itself as an “organisation.”²⁴⁹ Such situations are covered by other bodies of law rather than LOAC.²⁵⁰\n\n## E. Countermeasures\n\nSince the question regarding the permitted legal response to cyber operations “that do not reach the level of an armed attack” remains unsettled, scholars have suggested that states can use countermeasures, rather than self-defense, to respond to such cyber operations.²⁵¹ Countermeasures are permitted, under some circumstances, as a “response to low-intensity attacks”; they are not being used merely in military situations, but also as a response to “political and economic wrongs.”²⁵² For example, actions such as “hacking into a network” or “destroying data” in a way that interferes with any other states’ internal affairs or violates its sovereignty may warrant countermeasures.²⁵³ Further, using countermeasures as a response does not require using force.²⁵⁴ The legal logic behind the countermeasure’s alternative is that cyber armed attacks are\n\n245.

As mentioned previously, “[f]ew, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold,” while those that do not reach this point are more prevalent.²⁵⁵ Therefore, theoretically, states may find countermeasures useful for responding to cyber operations deemed to be an “internationally wrongful act” but not an “armed attack.”²⁵⁶\n\nAppealing as this option may be, it is not free from challenges.²⁵⁷ The main challenge being that countermeasures aim to repair the damage that was done, and “to return a situation to lawfulness.”²⁵⁸ Additionally, Article 52 on State Responsibility states that, if the victim state decides to take countermeasures, the hostile state must be informed of the intended action;²⁵⁹ and the victim state needs to start a negotiation in which it asks the hostile state to stop its “internationally wrongful act,” while providing the latter enough time to do so.²⁶⁰ Implementing these rules in a cyber context may be challenging and any such negotiation may be ineffective, as the hostile state may “within a short time” utilize any notification to “immunize itself from countermeasures” and thereby frustrate the purpose of notification.²⁶¹ Michael Schmitt provides an example of an attack against a state’s financial system. Schmitt posits that in the event that a significant, unlawful cyberattack is conducted against a victim state’s financial system, the latter may respond by using cyber countermeasures to deny the aggressor state access to its financial institutions. With that said, if the victim state essentially warned the aggressor about its intentions, the aggressor state could quickly “transfer assets out of the country” or remedy the system’s weaknesses, which would limit the victim state’s ability to conduct countermeasures.²⁶²\n\nThus, as Oona Hathaway and her co-authors point out, international law norms governing countermeasures are not comprehensive when it comes to addressing the issue of states’ responses to cyber operations.²⁶³ Indeed, Katharine Hinkle suggests that this legal framework “is far from ready to take on the challenges of the digital age.”²⁶⁴ Therefore, the level of\n\n255.

Due Diligence\n\nAnother important issue is the due diligence rule (Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 6).266 According to the Tallin Manual, this regulation is founded on a fundamental principle of international law, which holds that states have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the use of their sovereign territory against other states.267 The due diligence principle “requires that states not allow the use of their territory to carry out cyber operations against other states.”268 Thus, a state might be responsible for stopping an action carried out in its territory, even if this state was not at all involved.269\n\nDan Efrony and Yuval Shany state that the main challenge in applying the due-diligence principle is related to the “problem of attribution.”270 The problem is that the victim state needs to provide a piece of proof that connects the operation to the territory of the violating state in order for the latter to take “responsibility for lack of due-diligence,” however, in cyberspace states are hesitant to do so and subsequently disclose their identity. Therefore, the victim state might not provide this kind of proof.271 This makes the due diligence principle less applicable in the field of cyberspace.272 Another unsettled issue relates to the question of whether \"transit states\" are included in the due diligence principal requirements or if it only applies to the jurisdictions where the breaching cyber operations are carried out.273\n\n## G.

Under Article 2 of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, a state can be held responsible for \"an internationally wrongful act...consisting of an action or omission\" if it is \"(a) [attributable to the State under international law; and (b) [c]onstitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"281 Also, \"States are legally responsible for the conduct of their governmental organs or entities.\"282 Nevertheless, \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"283\n\nLiterature discusses two different legal standards of control, yet there is not yet a consensus on which one is more applicable to international law.284\n\n274.

Also, states are not permitted to use countermeasures as a result of such operations.³⁰⁰ Yet, cyber operations carried out by non-state actors on a “territory” of a state, but not stopped by that state, would be a violation of due diligence.³⁰¹ Also, under some circumstances, the law of self-defence³⁰² and LOAC may control cyber operations carried out by non-state actors.³⁰³\n\nTo summarize, there are both technical and legal hurdles when attributing cyber operations to states.³⁰⁴ The technical problems relate to the\n\n292.

Summary\n\nUsing Schmitt’s article as a starting point, this section identified eight core grey zones concerning the applicability of international law to cyber operations: sovereignty, non-intervention, use of force, self-defence, the law of armed conflict (LOAC), countermeasures, due diligence, and attribution. Under each of these grey zones there are several issues and questions which remained unresolved among scholars, experts, and States. With regards to sovereignty and non-intervention, Michael Schmitt poses the question as to whether something like the \"implantation of malware,\" resulting in no physical damage, breaches the principle of sovereignty.³⁰⁹ This section also analysed whether cyber operations carried out by non-state actors can breach the principle of sovereignty.³¹⁰ The last question involves determining which parameters to use when qualifying a cyber operation as \"coercive\" when assessing a potential violation of the principle of non-intervention.³¹¹\n\nWith regards to use of force, there is no consensus of whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force if it does not result in physical damage.³¹² Under the grey zone of self-defence there were five unsettled issues as summarized by Schmitt regarding regulating cyberwarfare. First, there is no consensus as to the threshold of destruction that needs to be reached in order to qualify a cyber operation as an armed attack, thus allowing a state to act in self-defence.³¹³ Second, it is not clear if a “series of cyber incidents that fall below the threshold of an armed attack” permit a state to act in self-\n\n305.

The first question is whether it is legal to target hackers who are civilians participating in the conflict (distinction).³¹⁸ The second question is whether “loss of functionality” is also included in the definition of “damage” when speaking about the resulting harm of a cyber operation (proportionality).³¹⁹ The proportionality analyses also encompasses whether any “incidental damage” to civilians might be caused even if there is a “military advantage” from the operation.³²⁰ The last question involves which precautions to take while conducting cyber operations as required by LOAC.³²¹\n\nWith regards to countermeasures, Schmitt raises the question as to whether it is possible to apply the requirement of notification under countermeasures to cyber operations.³²²\n\nThe due diligence principle has generated two main questions discussed in the literature. First, Efrony and Shany discuss the question of how the victim state can provide proof of the absence of due diligence of another state if the former refuses to disclose its identity;³²³ and the second, raised by Schmitt, is whether the due diligence principle applies merely to states in which the cyber operations originated or whether it also includes “transit States.”³²⁴ Finally, this Article, examining work by Lorraine Finlay and Christian Payne, recognizes technical and legal problems relating to state responsibility and attribution in the field of cyberspace.³²⁵\n\nSupporting the argument among scholars that these unsettled issues need to be resolved in order to advance the creation of an international\n\n314.

LEGAL CYNICISM AND CYBERSPACE\n\nIt seems that the application of international law to real-world situations involves some subjective elements.³²⁷ However, Shiri Krebs reflects on current scholarship when arguing that “beyond this inescapable subjectivity, international law is tainted by a degree of legal cynicism.”³²⁸ Several definitions of legal cynicism have been proposed in the literature.³²⁹ Emily Ryo recites one definition by Robert Sampson and Dawn Bartusch, who state that it is “a state of normlessness in which the rules of the dominant society [and hence the legal system]… are no longer binding in a community.”³³⁰ Ryo also puts forth an argument by David Kirk and Andrew Papachristos, who argue that legal cynicism refers to “a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement [such as the police and courts]…are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”³³¹ Ryo comes to the conclusion that these definitions all agree on a central premise that “legal cynicism relates to fundamental distrust ‘in the basic intention of the laws’ and legal authorities.”³³² Sometimes, “legal cynicism” can result in international law – and LOAC particularly – bearing the weight of “perceptions of illegitimacy” of the law.³³³ In areas where LOAC is ambiguous and unclear, its norms can be considered as worthless, as they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.³³⁴ This “illegitimacy weakens the legal authority of international law and its potential to guide behaviour during armed conflicts.”³³⁵ For example, the gaps and unsettled issues described throughout this Article can contribute to the legal cynicism in the emerging cyber warfare regime, and hence trigger distrust in its legal validity. Additionally, the lack of “enforcement” and\n\n326.

    "2023]\nMIND THE GAP(S)\n245\n\nFor the purpose of this Article, one relevant question, as examined by Michael Schmitt, within these positions is “[w]hen does a cyber operation constitute a wrongful ‘use of force’ in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations charter and customary international law?”346 States disagree on this topic. While France and the Netherlands determined that “a use of force need not be destructive or injurious,”347 the US, Israel, and Australia share the view that a cyber operation can be considered as use of force only if it results in physical harm.348 This suggests cyber-capable countries, such as the United States, Israel and Australia, find that only the most serious cyber incidents – which rarely occur in practice – are uses of force and legitimize less serious cyber incidents, whose damage is not physical (which are much more common). This can be analysed as a cynical use of international law.\n\nFurther, these conflicting views strengthen the cynical perception of international law, as each state or international actor can legitimately interpret the law according to their national needs and interests. This flexibility of the legal rules turns international law into a tool that justifies states’ actions, rather than providing clear guidance to states’ behaviour.349\n\nSecond, the example of the Stuxnet cyber operation is useful in this context. Applying the “use of force” position of the US, Israel, and Australia, articulated above, this operation should have been classified as a clear incident of “use of force” considering the significant physical destruction caused to the nuclear centrifuges at Natanz.350 In particular, as analysed by Andrew C. Foltz, the application of Schmitt’s seven criteria351 to the Stuxnet incident shows that “the worm was highly invasive, [and] caused direct and measurable physical damage.”352 Further, the Tallinn Group unanimously determined that Stuxnet should be considered as “use\n\n346.

Moreover, Iran’s silence on the issue has also had an impact on states and the international community that ignored this core legal question.356 This silence is highly significant, especially when comparing this operation to other international attacks which were directly condemned by the international community. For example, a recent physical attack by Iran on an Israeli ship, where two of the crew members were murdered, was severely condemned by the “G-7 Foreign Ministers,” including “Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States” as well as by the European Union who condemned this attack a few days after it had happened.357 As already shown above, a few States, including Israel and the United States (who were allegedly responsible for the Stuxnet operation),358 share the “view that a cyber operation can amount to use of force if it is expected to cause physical damage, injury or death.”359 Especially since Harold Koh360 remarked that “[c]yber activities that proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction would likely be viewed as a use of force” and added the example of “operations that trigger a nuclear plant meltdown.”361 This position is clearly inconsistent with the actions in the Stuxnet attack in which there was use of cyber capabilities to cause the very same damage.

This example strengthens the claim that much like legal cynicism in domestic contexts, international “law and the agents of its enforcement...are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.”362\n\nFinally, the issue of “use of force” also demonstrates how legal uncertainties can affect analysis of cyber cases, especially in borderline incidents, which do not constitute a clear case of “use of force” such as Stuxnet.363 For example, the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia can show how multi-interpretation of one case can render the law cynical and even irrelevant as any state can rely on different interpretation to justify its actions.364 While Michael Schmitt argues that the operations against Estonia “reached the use-of-force threshold” because they were severe and highly invasive, they had direct consequences which were difficult to quantify, there was immediate disruption, and the operation was not necessarily legitimate under international law,365 others argue that these operations cannot be qualified as a “use of force” violating Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.366 According to these commentators, like Reese Nguyen, these operations were not serious, took place without any physical invasion, their effects were not immediate, their “effects were indirect,” and they were assumed to be legal under international law due to the fact that they “merely interrupted communications systems.”367 Also, there was no physical destruction done to Estonia’s infrastructure.368 Moreover, Russell Buchan argued that these operations violated Estonia’s sovereignty and thus constitute an unlawful intervention, rather than use of force.369 These conflicting viewpoints and various analyses of the same cyber operation emphasize the weakness of these criteria and show how readily they may be altered to serve the interests of different states.370 Such criteria should be solid and not open for multi-interpretations. For example, whether a certain operation causes physical damage should not be arguable and subject to disagreements. The Estonia case is only one example of the legal uncertainties and disagreements which render international law a tool to justify – rather than guide – behaviour. Also, the fact that scholars and experts have come to opposite conclusions regarding the same case\n\n362. Ryo, supra note 329, at 1015 (citing David S. Kirk and Andrew V.

First, conflicting interpretations and uncertainty about the legal rules allow states to behave according to their national strategies and interests and use international law to justify their actions.371 Second, the weak enforcement mechanism characterizing international law enables states to act inconsistently with their own positions.372 Finally, as long as the grey zones of cyberspace detailed above remain open and unclarified, states may continue to harness international law to their political agenda and security policies; they may prohibit, limit, or delegitimise actions or methods that they identify as less useful or necessary for their national interests and vice versa.373\n\nIn addition, it is important to discuss the grey zone of attribution as another aspect of cynicism; even when there is information available linking states to cyber operations, the high legal standard of control is used cynically to prevent attribution and shield states from responsibility.374 Hence, the legal cynicism in cyberspace is derived from both uncertainties about facts and uncertainties about the actors conducting the operations (attribution). This legal cynicism harms the legitimacy of international law and hinders the development of an efficient legal regime regulating cyber warfare.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nDespite many efforts, there is still no specialized, binding international regime tailored specifically for the unique challenges of cyber warfare.375 Due to the constituent elements of cyberspace detailed above, applying existing international norms to cyber operations generates many unresolved grey zones.376 While LOAC generally applies to cyber operations, during or outside armed conflict,377 the existing uncertainties require clarification, either by the development of customary international law or by a specialized international convention or treaty designed to regulate cyber warfare.378 This\n\n371.

Possible pathways to do so are to empirically examine states’ positions concerning each of the identified grey zones, or to identify emerging agreements among states, which could lead to meaningful progresses in the development of the international law of cyber warfare.³⁸¹\n\n379.
