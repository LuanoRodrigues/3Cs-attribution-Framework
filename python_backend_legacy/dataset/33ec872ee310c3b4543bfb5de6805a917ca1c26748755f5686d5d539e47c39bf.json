One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\n\nF.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\n\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\n\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical.¹ There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State.² It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\n\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences.³ This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\n\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.⁴\n\n¹ Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n² Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al.

The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\n\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\n\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State⁵ or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State.⁶ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n\n⁵ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

Delerue\n\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\n\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State,⁷ but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\n\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions.⁸ The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion.⁹ Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively.¹⁰ It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY.¹¹ It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n\n---\n\n⁷ See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n\n⁸ ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14]\n\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\n\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n\n[12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.",

Delerue\n\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15]\n\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\n\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18]\n\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\n\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\n\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\n\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21]\n\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law.

Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\n\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.²⁵\n\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.²⁶\n\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\n\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.²⁷\n\n²² *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n\n²³ Ibid., para. 116.

Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State.⁶³ The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context.⁶⁴ The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ.

In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\n\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\n\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\n\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them.

The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\n\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87]\n\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\n\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88]\n\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test.

It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\n\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\n\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\n\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.",

            "markdown": "Attribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\n\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92]\n\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\n\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94]\n\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\n\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n\n92 Shackelford (2009), p. 27; Schmitt (2013), pp. 29–34, commentary to Rule 6, paras. 1–14; Woltag (2014), pp. 87–94; Roscini (2010), p. 100.\n\n93 Shackelford (2009), p. 203; Woltag (2014), p. 91.\n\n94 Roscini (2010), pp. 100–101; Woltag (2014), pp. 90–93.",

Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\n\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks.⁹⁵ Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction.⁹⁶ The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\n\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\n\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement.⁹⁷ However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\n\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.⁹⁸\n\n⁹⁵ Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n\n⁹⁶ Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n\n⁹⁷ RIA Novosti (2007).\n\n⁹⁸ Clover (2009).",

Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\n\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\n\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\n\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\n\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\n\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.",

The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\n\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\n\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\n\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\n\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be",

PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions.¹⁰² On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\n\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.¹⁰³\n\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\n\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n\n¹⁰² See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n\n¹⁰³ Francioni (2011), p. 102.",

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\nF.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical.¹ There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State.² It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences.³ This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.⁴\n¹ Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n² Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al. (2014), p. 58; Roscini (2015a), p. 240; republished with minor changes in: Roscini (2015b).\n³ Brenner (2007), pp. 380 and 405.\n⁴ ICJ, Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, pp. 38–39, para. 57.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nThe problem of conduct “shrouded in secrecy” is even more relevant in the case of cyber operations. The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State⁵ or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State.⁶ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n⁵ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State,⁷ but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions.⁸ The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion.⁹ Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively.¹⁰ It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY.¹¹ It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n---\n⁷ See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n⁸ ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14]\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n[12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15]\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18]\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21]\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would\n[15] Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n[16] “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid., para 86.\n[19] Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n[20] Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[21] Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ngive rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States.²² The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States.²³ To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State”²⁴ which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.²⁵\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.²⁶\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.²⁷\n²² *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n²³ Ibid., para. 116. The Court found, however, the United States responsible for their own conduct in relation to the Contras, constituting violations of the principle of non-intervention and of the sovereignty of Nicaragua.

Delerue\nThe Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard.²⁸ The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State.²⁹ The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case,³⁰ which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test\nIn the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test.³¹ This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.³²\nThe ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.³³ This\n²⁸ Klabbers (2013), p. 129.\n²⁹ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\n³⁰ ICTY, Trial Chamber, Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T; ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor vs Dusko Tadić (Judgment), Judgment of 15 July 1999, IT-94-1-A.\n³¹ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber), cit.; for the purpose of this Section we focus on the Appeal Chamber decision, the question of attribution has also been dealt with in the first instance of the case: ICTY, Tadić (Trial Judgement) cit.\n³² ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor v.

What is at issue is a preliminary question: that of the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State. Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply. In both cases, what is at issue is not the distinction between State responsibility and individual criminal responsibility. Rather, the question is that of establishing the criteria for the legal imputability to a State of acts performed by individuals not having the status of State officials. In the one case\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ndivergence of objectives is one of the main bases for criticism of the approach adopted by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in the Tadić case.³⁴\nIn this case, the ICTY tried Duško Tadić, a Bosnian Serb, for numerous offences committed during 1992 at the Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje camps, and other locations in the Prijedor municipality in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute.³⁵ This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.³⁶\nAn international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory.³⁷ The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”,³⁸ and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.³⁹\nThe Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as\nthese acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n³⁴ It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n³⁵ Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n³⁶ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 86.\n³⁸ Ibid., para. 84.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue\nIHL does not deal with this question.⁴⁰ The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.⁴¹ The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”,⁴² because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”,⁴³ and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”.⁴⁴ It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case.⁴⁵ The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission,⁴⁶ the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal,⁴⁷ the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights,⁴⁸ and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf.⁴⁹ Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach.⁵⁰ Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.⁵¹\nThe Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.⁵² In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57\nThe effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62\nIt appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ.

Delerue\nthe determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State.⁶³ The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context.⁶⁴ The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven),⁶⁵ and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be.⁶⁶ This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.⁶⁷\n## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility.

Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.⁷²\nThe ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”.⁷³ These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”.⁷⁴ The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test\nAfter the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case.⁷⁵ In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n⁶⁹ Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n⁷⁰ De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n⁷¹ Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n⁷² ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n⁷³ Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n⁷⁴ Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n⁷⁵ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\n## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case\nIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that:\nThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs\n76 Armed Activities (Judgment) cit., para. 160.\n77 Ibid., para. 161.\n78 Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 406–407; Abass (2007), p. 890; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 606–611.\n79 On the question of attribution in the Bosnian Genocide case, see generally: Griebel and Plücken (2008) and Milanovic (2009).\n80 Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 297 and 376.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nof the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.[81]\nThe Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively.[82] As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the \"complete dependence\" test developed in the Nicaragua case,[83] and again answered negatively.[84]\nAs the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State.[85] The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,[86] which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87]\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88]\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test. In this respect, the Court noted that \"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility\n[81] Ibid., para. 384.\n[82] Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n[83] Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n[84] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n[85] Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n[86] Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008). Marco Milanović criticized the interpretation made by these authors in Milanovic (2009).\n[87] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n[88] Ibid., para. 406.\nunder the rule of customary international law set out in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility”. It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92]\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94]\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n92 Shackelford (2009), p. 27; Schmitt (2013), pp. 29–34, commentary to Rule 6, paras. 1–14; Woltag (2014), pp. 87–94; Roscini (2010), p. 100.\n93 Shackelford (2009), p. 203; Woltag (2014), p. 91.\n94 Roscini (2010), pp. 100–101; Woltag (2014), pp. 90–93.\nF. Delerue\nweapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks.⁹⁵ Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction.⁹⁶ The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement.⁹⁷ However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.⁹⁸\n⁹⁵ Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n⁹⁶ Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n⁹⁷ RIA Novosti (2007).\n⁹⁸ Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nattributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions.¹⁰² On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.¹⁰³\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n¹⁰² See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n¹⁰³ Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\nF.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical. There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State. It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences. This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.\n Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al.

United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, pp. 38–39, para. 57.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nThe problem of conduct “shrouded in secrecy” is even more relevant in the case of cyber operations. The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania*), Judgment on the Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, p. 18; De Frouville (2010), p. 261.\n De Frouville (2010), pp. 261–264.; see also Klabbers (2013), p. 128; ILC (2001), p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1. For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State, but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions. The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion. Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively. It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY. It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n---\n See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14]\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n[12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15]\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18]\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21]\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would\n[15] Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n[16] “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid., para 86.\n[19] Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n[20] Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[21] Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ngive rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States. The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States. To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State” which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.\n *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n Ibid., para. 116. The Court found, however, the United States responsible for their own conduct in relation to the Contras, constituting violations of the principle of non-intervention and of the sovereignty of Nicaragua.

Delerue\nThe Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard. The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State. The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case, which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test\nIn the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test. This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\nThe ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.

What is at issue is a preliminary question: that of the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State. Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply. In both cases, what is at issue is not the distinction between State responsibility and individual criminal responsibility. Rather, the question is that of establishing the criteria for the legal imputability to a State of acts performed by individuals not having the status of State officials. In the one case\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ndivergence of objectives is one of the main bases for criticism of the approach adopted by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in the Tadić case.\nIn this case, the ICTY tried Duško Tadić, a Bosnian Serb, for numerous offences committed during 1992 at the Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje camps, and other locations in the Prijedor municipality in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute. This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.\nAn international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory. The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”, and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.\nThe Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as\nthese acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n Ibid., para. 86.\n Ibid., para. 84.\n Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue\nIHL does not deal with this question. The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case. The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”, because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”, and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”. It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case. The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission, the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights, and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf. Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach. Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.\nThe Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”. In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57\nThe effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62\nIt appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ. The ICJ in the Nicaragua case developed two tests: the “strict control” test for\n\nF. Delerue\nthe determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State. The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context. The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven), and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be. This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.\n## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility. Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State”, reads:\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nThe three alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction”, and “control” of the ILC differ from the *Nicaragua* and *Tadić* tests. The ILC’s approach seems less\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 397.\n ICTY, Trial Chamber, *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić* (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T ‘Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mcdonald Regarding the Applicability of Article 2 of the Statute’, p. 288; see also De Hoogh (2002), p. 290; Milanovic (2006), p. 581; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 612–613; Talmon (2009), p. 507.\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 406; ILC (2001), p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 5.\n Kreß (2001), p. 131; Talmon (2009), pp. 506–507.\n The literature on cyber operations and international law has also misled by this confusion: Schmitt (2013), p. 32, commentary to Rule 6, para. 10; Woltag (2014), pp. 89–91.\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53rd session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Article 8.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nrestrictive than the approach followed by the ICJ, and has been considered as “a good compromise, in the sense that it is sufficiently vague to allow different interpretations”. It appears, however, that the ILC favoured the “effective control” test of the ICJ over the “overall control” test of the ICTY.\nIt must be noted that the ILC did not follow the distinction between, on the one hand, single individuals and unorganized groups, and on the other hand, organized groups, developed by the ICTY. Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.\nThe ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”. These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”. The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test\nAfter the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case. In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\n## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case\nIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that:\nThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs\n\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nof the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.[81]\nThe Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively.[82] As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the \"complete dependence\" test developed in the Nicaragua case,[83] and again answered negatively.[84]\nAs the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State.[85] The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,[86] which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87]\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88]\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test. In this respect, the Court noted that \"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility\n[81] Ibid., para. 384.\n[82] Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n[83] Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n[84] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n[85] Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n[86] Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008). Marco Milanović criticized the interpretation made by these authors in Milanovic (2009).\n[87] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n[88] Ibid., para. 406.\nunder the rule of customary international law set out in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility”. It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92]\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94]\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n\nF. Delerue\nweapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks. Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction. The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement. However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.\n Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n RIA Novosti (2007).\n Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nattributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions. On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\nF.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical. There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State. It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences. This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.\n Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al.

The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State, but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions. The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion. Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively. It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY. It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n---\n See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14]\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n[12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15]\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18]\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21]\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would\n[15] Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n[16] “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid., para 86.\n[19] Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n[20] Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[21] Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ngive rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States. The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States. To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State” which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.\n *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n Ibid., para. 116.

Delerue\nThe Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard. The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State. The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case, which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test\nIn the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test. This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\nThe ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.

What is at issue is a preliminary question: that of the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State. Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply. In both cases, what is at issue is not the distinction between State responsibility and individual criminal responsibility. Rather, the question is that of establishing the criteria for the legal imputability to a State of acts performed by individuals not having the status of State officials. In the one case\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ndivergence of objectives is one of the main bases for criticism of the approach adopted by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in the Tadić case.\nIn this case, the ICTY tried Duško Tadić, a Bosnian Serb, for numerous offences committed during 1992 at the Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje camps, and other locations in the Prijedor municipality in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute. This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.\nAn international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory. The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”, and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.\nThe Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as\nthese acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n Ibid., para. 86.\n Ibid., para. 84.\n Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue\nIHL does not deal with this question. The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case. The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”, because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”, and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”. It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case. The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission, the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights, and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf. Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach. Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.\nThe Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”. In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Antonio Cassese, who acted as a judge in the Tadić case, answered the critics of Marko Milanović in an article: Cassese (2007), p. 658, footnote 17. Antonio Cassese also argued that the approach developed in the Tadić case has been adopted in subsequent international cases and practice: ibid., pp. 659–661, especially footnotes 18–19.\n See generally the analysis in Mahiou (2009), pp. 433–435.\n ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 117.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nChamber thus distinguished between two degrees of control: “private individuals” and “organized and hierarchically structured groups”.53\nIn the case of private individuals, to attribute an act to a State it is necessary to prove that this State gave specific instructions for the performance of this very act.54 The “specific instruction” test applies to both individuals and unorganized military groups.55 As observed by Antonio Cassese, “this was clearly the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in Nicaragua”.56\nConversely, in the case of organized and hierarchically structured groups, the Chamber adopted the “overall control” test, which differs from the Nicaragua case “effective control” test. Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57\nThe effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62\nIt appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ. The ICJ in the Nicaragua case developed two tests: the “strict control” test for\n\nF. Delerue\nthe determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State. The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context. The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven), and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be. This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.\n## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility. Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State”, reads:\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nThe three alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction”, and “control” of the ILC differ from the *Nicaragua* and *Tadić* tests. The ILC’s approach seems less\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 397.\n ICTY, Trial Chamber, *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić* (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T ‘Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mcdonald Regarding the Applicability of Article 2 of the Statute’, p. 288; see also De Hoogh (2002), p. 290; Milanovic (2006), p. 581; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 612–613; Talmon (2009), p. 507.\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 406; ILC (2001), p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 5.\n Kreß (2001), p. 131; Talmon (2009), pp. 506–507.\n The literature on cyber operations and international law has also misled by this confusion: Schmitt (2013), p. 32, commentary to Rule 6, para. 10; Woltag (2014), pp. 89–91.\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53rd session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Article 8.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nrestrictive than the approach followed by the ICJ, and has been considered as “a good compromise, in the sense that it is sufficiently vague to allow different interpretations”. It appears, however, that the ILC favoured the “effective control” test of the ICJ over the “overall control” test of the ICTY.\nIt must be noted that the ILC did not follow the distinction between, on the one hand, single individuals and unorganized groups, and on the other hand, organized groups, developed by the ICTY. Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.\nThe ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”. These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”. The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test\nAfter the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case. In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\n## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case\nIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that:\nThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs\n\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nof the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.[81]\nThe Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively.[82] As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the \"complete dependence\" test developed in the Nicaragua case,[83] and again answered negatively.[84]\nAs the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State.[85] The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,[86] which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87]\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88]\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test. In this respect, the Court noted that \"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility\n[81] Ibid., para. 384.\n[82] Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n[83] Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n[84] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n[85] Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n[86] Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008). Marco Milanović criticized the interpretation made by these authors in Milanovic (2009).\n[87] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n[88] Ibid., para. 406.\nunder the rule of customary international law set out in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility”. It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92]\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94]\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n\nF. Delerue\nweapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks. Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction. The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement. However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.\n Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n RIA Novosti (2007).\n Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nattributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions. On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\nF.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical. There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State. It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences. This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.\n Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al.

United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, pp. 38–39, para. 57.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nThe problem of conduct “shrouded in secrecy” is even more relevant in the case of cyber operations. The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania*), Judgment on the Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, p. 18; De Frouville (2010), p. 261.\n De Frouville (2010), pp. 261–264.; see also Klabbers (2013), p. 128; ILC (2001), p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1. For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State, but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions. The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion. Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively. It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY. It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n---\n See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*), Judgment, 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 207, para. 397.\n Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n Ibid., paras. 390–395.\n Ibid., paras. 396–412.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 3 Diversity of Approaches on the Attribution of Acts Conducted Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe ICJ, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Law Commission (ILC) have followed different approaches on the attribution of conduct of non-state actors acting under the direction, instructions or control of a State, which are analysed in the present section.\n# 3.1 The ICJ's Nicaragua Case and the \"Effective Control\" Test\nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ applied two different tests to assess the degree of control of a State over a non-state actor: the \"strict control\" test and the \"effective control\" test. The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14]\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n[12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15]\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18]\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21]\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would\n[15] Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n[16] “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid., para 86.\n[19] Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n[20] Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[21] Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ngive rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States. The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States. To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State” which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.\n *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n Ibid., para. 116. The Court found, however, the United States responsible for their own conduct in relation to the Contras, constituting violations of the principle of non-intervention and of the sovereignty of Nicaragua.

Delerue\nThe Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard. The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State. The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case, which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test\nIn the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test. This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\nThe ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.

What is at issue is a preliminary question: that of the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State. Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply. In both cases, what is at issue is not the distinction between State responsibility and individual criminal responsibility. Rather, the question is that of establishing the criteria for the legal imputability to a State of acts performed by individuals not having the status of State officials. In the one case\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ndivergence of objectives is one of the main bases for criticism of the approach adopted by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in the Tadić case.\nIn this case, the ICTY tried Duško Tadić, a Bosnian Serb, for numerous offences committed during 1992 at the Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje camps, and other locations in the Prijedor municipality in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute. This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.\nAn international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory. The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”, and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.\nThe Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as\nthese acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n Ibid., para. 86.\n Ibid., para. 84.\n Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue\nIHL does not deal with this question. The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case. The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”, because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”, and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”. It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case. The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission, the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights, and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf. Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach. Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.\nThe Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”. In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Antonio Cassese, who acted as a judge in the Tadić case, answered the critics of Marko Milanović in an article: Cassese (2007), p. 658, footnote 17. Antonio Cassese also argued that the approach developed in the Tadić case has been adopted in subsequent international cases and practice: ibid., pp. 659–661, especially footnotes 18–19.\n See generally the analysis in Mahiou (2009), pp. 433–435.\n ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 117.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nChamber thus distinguished between two degrees of control: “private individuals” and “organized and hierarchically structured groups”.53\nIn the case of private individuals, to attribute an act to a State it is necessary to prove that this State gave specific instructions for the performance of this very act.54 The “specific instruction” test applies to both individuals and unorganized military groups.55 As observed by Antonio Cassese, “this was clearly the ‘effective control’ test set out by the ICJ in Nicaragua”.56\nConversely, in the case of organized and hierarchically structured groups, the Chamber adopted the “overall control” test, which differs from the Nicaragua case “effective control” test. Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57\nThe effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62\nIt appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ. The ICJ in the Nicaragua case developed two tests: the “strict control” test for\n\nF. Delerue\nthe determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State. The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context. The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven), and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be. This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.\n## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility. Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State”, reads:\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\nThe three alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction”, and “control” of the ILC differ from the *Nicaragua* and *Tadić* tests. The ILC’s approach seems less\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 397.\n ICTY, Trial Chamber, *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić* (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T ‘Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mcdonald Regarding the Applicability of Article 2 of the Statute’, p. 288; see also De Hoogh (2002), p. 290; Milanovic (2006), p. 581; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 612–613; Talmon (2009), p. 507.\n *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 406; ILC (2001), p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 5.\n Kreß (2001), p. 131; Talmon (2009), pp. 506–507.\n The literature on cyber operations and international law has also misled by this confusion: Schmitt (2013), p. 32, commentary to Rule 6, para. 10; Woltag (2014), pp. 89–91.\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53rd session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Article 8.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nrestrictive than the approach followed by the ICJ, and has been considered as “a good compromise, in the sense that it is sufficiently vague to allow different interpretations”. It appears, however, that the ILC favoured the “effective control” test of the ICJ over the “overall control” test of the ICTY.\nIt must be noted that the ILC did not follow the distinction between, on the one hand, single individuals and unorganized groups, and on the other hand, organized groups, developed by the ICTY. Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.\nThe ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”. These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”. The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test\nAfter the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case. In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\n## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case\nIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that:\nThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs\n\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nof the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.[81]\nThe Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively.[82] As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the \"complete dependence\" test developed in the Nicaragua case,[83] and again answered negatively.[84]\nAs the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State.[85] The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,[86] which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87]\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88]\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test. In this respect, the Court noted that \"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility\n[81] Ibid., para. 384.\n[82] Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n[83] Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n[84] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n[85] Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n[86] Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008). Marco Milanović criticized the interpretation made by these authors in Milanovic (2009).\n[87] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n[88] Ibid., para. 406.\nunder the rule of customary international law set out in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility”. It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92]\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94]\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n\nF. Delerue\nweapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks. Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction. The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement. However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.\n Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n RIA Novosti (2007).\n Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nattributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions. On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction\nAttribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question \"who did it?\" The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means\nF. Delerue (✉)\nInstitut de recherche stratégique de l'École militaire (IRSEM), Paris, France\ne-mail: francois.delerue@eui.eu\n© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019\nE. Carpanelli, N.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical.¹ There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State.² It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences.³ This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that:\nOne of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.⁴\n¹ Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n² Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al. (2014), p. 58; Roscini (2015a), p. 240; republished with minor changes in: Roscini (2015b).\n³ Brenner (2007), pp. 380 and 405.\n⁴ ICJ, Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, pp. 38–39, para. 57.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nThe problem of conduct “shrouded in secrecy” is even more relevant in the case of cyber operations. The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State⁵ or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State.⁶ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n⁵ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania*), Judgment on the Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, p. 18; De Frouville (2010), p. 261.\n⁶ De Frouville (2010), pp. 261–264.; see also Klabbers (2013), p. 128; ILC (2001), p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1. For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue\n# 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State,⁷ but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions.⁸ The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion.⁹ Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively.¹⁰ It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY.¹¹ It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n---\n⁷ See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n⁸ ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*), Judgment, 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 207, para. 397.\n⁹ Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n¹⁰ Ibid., paras. 390–395.\n¹¹ Ibid., paras. 396–412.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 3 Diversity of Approaches on the Attribution of Acts Conducted Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State\nThe ICJ, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Law Commission (ILC) have followed different approaches on the attribution of conduct of non-state actors acting under the direction, instructions or control of a State, which are analysed in the present section.\n# 3.1 The ICJ's Nicaragua Case and the \"Effective Control\" Test\nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ applied two different tests to assess the degree of control of a State over a non-state actor: the \"strict control\" test and the \"effective control\" test. The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the \"effective control\" test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven. The \"effective control\" test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State. The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.\nThe Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case:\n Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the \"strict control test\" and second the \"effective control test\" in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\nfirstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.\nThe ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs. These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States \"in a more direct manner\". The Court focusing on some incidents established that:\nAlthough it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.\nConsequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the \"planning, direction, support and execution\" of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States. The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled. This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.\nIn the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would\n Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para 86.\n Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\ngive rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States.²² The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States.²³ To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State”²⁴ which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows:\nIt seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.²⁵\nIn relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.²⁶\nIn order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not:\nIn the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.²⁷\n²² *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n²³ Ibid., para. 116. The Court found, however, the United States responsible for their own conduct in relation to the Contras, constituting violations of the principle of non-intervention and of the sovereignty of Nicaragua.

Delerue\nThe Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard.²⁸ The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State.²⁹ The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case,³⁰ which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test\nIn the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test.³¹ This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.³²\nThe ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.³³ This\n²⁸ Klabbers (2013), p. 129.\n²⁹ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\n³⁰ ICTY, Trial Chamber, Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T; ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor vs Dusko Tadić (Judgment), Judgment of 15 July 1999, IT-94-1-A.\n³¹ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber), cit.; for the purpose of this Section we focus on the Appeal Chamber decision, the question of attribution has also been dealt with in the first instance of the case: ICTY, Tadić (Trial Judgement) cit.\n³² ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor v.

Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply.

After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute.³⁵ This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.³⁶\nAn international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory.³⁷ The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”,³⁸ and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.³⁹\nThe Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as\nthese acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n³⁴ It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n³⁵ Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n³⁶ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 86.\n³⁸ Ibid., para. 84.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue\nIHL does not deal with this question.⁴⁰ The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.⁴¹ The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”,⁴² because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”,⁴³ and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”.⁴⁴ It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case.⁴⁵ The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission,⁴⁶ the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal,⁴⁷ the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights,⁴⁸ and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf.⁴⁹ Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach.⁵⁰ Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.⁵¹\nThe Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.⁵² In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57\nThe effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60\nThe Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62\nIt appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ. The ICJ in the Nicaragua case developed two tests: the “strict control” test for\n53 Ibid., para. 117; for a comprehensive analysis see Cassese (2007), pp. 655–663.\n54 ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., paras. 118–119.\n55 Ibid., para. 141.\n56 Cassese (2007), p. 657.\n57 ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para. 120.\n58 Ibid., paras. 131 and 137.

Delerue\nthe determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State.⁶³ The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context.⁶⁴ The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven),⁶⁵ and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be.⁶⁶ This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.⁶⁷\n## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility. Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State”, reads:\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.⁶⁸\nThe three alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction”, and “control” of the ILC differ from the *Nicaragua* and *Tadić* tests. The ILC’s approach seems less\n⁶³ *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 397.\n⁶⁴ ICTY, Trial Chamber, *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić* (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T ‘Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mcdonald Regarding the Applicability of Article 2 of the Statute’, p. 288; see also De Hoogh (2002), p. 290; Milanovic (2006), p. 581; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 612–613; Talmon (2009), p. 507.\n⁶⁵ *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 406; ILC (2001), p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 5.\n⁶⁶ Kreß (2001), p. 131; Talmon (2009), pp. 506–507.\n⁶⁷ The literature on cyber operations and international law has also misled by this confusion: Schmitt (2013), p. 32, commentary to Rule 6, para. 10; Woltag (2014), pp. 89–91.\n⁶⁸ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53rd session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Article 8.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nrestrictive than the approach followed by the ICJ,⁶⁹ and has been considered as “a good compromise, in the sense that it is sufficiently vague to allow different interpretations”.⁷⁰ It appears, however, that the ILC favoured the “effective control” test of the ICJ over the “overall control” test of the ICTY.⁷¹\nIt must be noted that the ILC did not follow the distinction between, on the one hand, single individuals and unorganized groups, and on the other hand, organized groups, developed by the ICTY. Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.⁷²\nThe ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”.⁷³ These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”.⁷⁴ The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test\nAfter the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case.⁷⁵ In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n⁶⁹ Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n⁷⁰ De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n⁷¹ Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n⁷² ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n⁷³ Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n⁷⁴ Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n⁷⁵ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue\n## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case\nIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77\nIn the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case\nMore recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78\nIn this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that:\nThis question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs\n76 Armed Activities (Judgment) cit., para. 160.\n77 Ibid., para. 161.\n78 Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 406–407; Abass (2007), p. 890; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 606–611.\n79 On the question of attribution in the Bosnian Genocide case, see generally: Griebel and Plücken (2008) and Milanovic (2009).\n80 Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 297 and 376.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nof the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.\nThe Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively. As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the \"complete dependence\" test developed in the Nicaragua case, and again answered negatively.\nAs the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State. The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the \"overall control\" test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the:\nlogic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.\nMoreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that:\nIt must next be noted that the \"overall control\" test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.\nConsequently, the ICJ did not follow the \"overall control\" test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the \"effective control\" test. In this respect, the Court noted that \"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility\n Ibid., para. 384.\n Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008).

It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches\nThe previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\n# 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations\nState-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.\nCyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.\nThese examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard \"arming and training\" means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these\n92 Shackelford (2009), p. 27; Schmitt (2013), pp. 29–34, commentary to Rule 6, paras. 1–14; Woltag (2014), pp. 87–94; Roscini (2010), p. 100.\n93 Shackelford (2009), p. 203; Woltag (2014), p. 91.\n94 Roscini (2010), pp. 100–101; Woltag (2014), pp. 90–93.\nF. Delerue\nweapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks.⁹⁵ Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction.⁹⁶ The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks\nThe Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement.⁹⁷ However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement:\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.⁹⁸\n⁹⁵ Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n⁹⁶ Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n⁹⁷ RIA Novosti (2007).\n⁹⁸ Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies\nThe conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors\nattributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions.¹⁰² On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the \"effective control\" test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The \"overall control\" test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs:\nUnder the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.¹⁰³\nWhen recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the \"effective control\" test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the \"overall control\" test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks\nCyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n¹⁰² See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n¹⁰³ Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.

One of the main issues is the impossibility in most cases, at least to date, to identify clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either individuals or State agents, and to determine whether their conducts are attributable to States or other subjects of international law. Most cyber operations generally alleged to be state-sponsored have not been clearly attributed to a State yet. International law cannot bring a solution to the technical problem of attribution. However, attribution cannot be limited to its technical aspects. Generally, attribution of cyber conducts has three different dimensions: firstly, the attribution to the machine from which the cyber operation was launched or had transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, notably a State. The present Chapter focuses on attribution from an international law perspective, that is to say attribution of a conduct to a State or another subject of international law. More specifically, it focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\n# 1 Introduction Attribution refers to the process of attributing an act or conduct to its perpetrator. In other words, it aims at answering the question\"who did it?\"The attribution, also referred to as the imputation, is the legal operation aiming at determining that an act or omission is to be characterized as an act of the State under international law. The State is an abstract entity. Thus, it can only act by the medium of one or more persons, which are considered for the purpose of the attribution to a State as the means F.

State-sponsored cyber operations, generally coined as cyber warfare, constitute a real challenge for international security and international law. One of the main issues is the extreme difficulty and sometimes impossibility, at least to date, of identifying clearly the perpetrators of cyber operations, either private individuals or State agents, and of determining whether their conduct is attributable to States or other subjects of international law.\nThe present Chapter focuses on the attribution process from an international law perspective, and thus aims at answering the question: how to attribute a cyber operation to an alleged sponsoring State? This question is essential as most responses to cyber operations cannot be deployed without attribution. For instance, defensive measures and countermeasures cannot be taken nor can the responsibility of the perpetrating State be invoked without attribution. The identified perpetrator—a machine, a person or a State—will determine the possible technical or legal responses.\nThe process of attribution is at the same time legal, factual and technical.¹ There are several dimensions of attribution when it comes to cyber operations that are generally grouped into three categories: firstly, the attribution to the machines from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited; secondly, the attribution to the person who conducted the cyber operations; and thirdly, the attribution to an aggregate entity, usually a State.² It is, however, important to note that each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible State even without any knowledge of the perpetrating machine or individuals involved.\nFurthermore, before considering the process of attribution, it is necessary to clearly identify the cyber operation, its nature and consequences.³ This procedure is, of course, not limited to cyber operations but rather applies to all investigations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) highlighted this point in the Nicaragua case, holding that: One of the Court’s chief difficulties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute. [...] Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it. The problem is then not the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State for the purpose of establishing responsibility, but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator. The occurrence of the act itself may, however, have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.⁴ ¹ Tsagourias (2012), p. 233; Tait (2016).\n² Landau and Clark (2010), p. 37; Clark et al.

United States of America), Merits, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, pp. 38–39, para. 57.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors The problem of conduct “shrouded in secrecy” is even more relevant in the case of cyber operations. The victim State has first to establish that it is the victim of a cyber operation, and to determine what is actually happening. In the case of Stuxnet, for instance, the premature wear of the centrifuges of the Natanz nuclear facility may have been first attributed to a malfunction or to a defect of the centrifuges rather than to a malware. Identifying the cyber operation and its effect is a preliminary step in the attribution process.\nThe question of the imputation of cyber operations to a State cannot be studied without dealing with questions of the imputation of cyber conduct to computers or individual perpetrators. The attribution to a machine or a person is mainly based on technical and forensics methods, while the attribution to a State is mainly based on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution. The attribution of a cyber operation to a State depends on the available factual evidence, and thus it may depend on the identification of the machine or individual responsible.\nPrivate individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in State activities. The fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a State⁵ or conducted by citizens of a State is not a sufficient reason to attribute these acts to the State.⁶ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the State, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the State, if they use public power in the absence or default of the State, and finally if the State endorses a posteriori their conduct. The present Chapter focuses on the specific question of attribution of cyber operations conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State.\nThe attribution of conduct perpetrated under the instructions, direction or control of a State leads to various interpretations and debates that need to be analysed (Sect. 3) prior to identifying how it would apply in the cyber context (Sect. 4). Before that, it is necessary to distinguish the process of attribution of cyber operations conducted by a de facto organ of a State and the one applying to cyber operations conducted by non-state actors acting under the instructions, direction or control of a State (Sect. 2).\n⁵ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (*United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania*), Judgment on the Merits, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, p. 18; De Frouville (2010), p. 261.\n⁶ De Frouville (2010), pp. 261–264.; see also Klabbers (2013), p. 128; ILC (2001), p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1. For instance, in the *Tehran Hostage* case, the Court did not use the fact that the group of militant students, who occupied the US embassy in Tehran and US consulates in Shiraz and Tabriz, were Iranian citizens in order to attribute their conduct to Iran: ICJ, *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran* (*United States of America v. Iran*), Judgment, 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, pp. 30–31, paras. 58–60. The Court, however, noted that this “does not mean that Iran is, in consequence, free of any responsibility in regard to those attacks” (ibid., para. 61).\nF. Delerue # 2 Distinction Between *De facto* Organ of the State and Acts Perpetrated Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State The situation of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State is also sometimes labelled as acts of *de facto* organ of the State,⁷ but must be distinguished from the situation of *de facto* organs. The use of the label *de facto* organs to refer to two different situations is confusing. In the case of a *de facto* organ of the State, understood as a State organ not qualified as such under municipal law, all the conduct of this *de facto* organ can be attributed to the State, even if they amount to *ultra vires* acts. In the present situation, the individuals are not qualified as State organs, and thus not all their acts are attributable to the State; a case-by-case analysis is necessary to determine which acts were actually conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State and thus attributable to this State.\nThe reasoning of the ICJ in the *Bosnian genocide* case might be the best illustration of the distinction between these various tests and notions.⁸ The ICJ followed a three-step reasoning process for the question of the attribution of the Srebrenica Genocide to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Firstly, the Court analysed whether the attribution could be made on the basis of conduct by a *de jure* state organ of FRY, and came to a negative conclusion.⁹ Consequently, the Court analysed whether the entities involved in the acts could be considered *de facto* organs of the FRY, using the “complete dependence” test, and also here concluded negatively.¹⁰ It was then clear that the Srebrenica genocide had not been perpetrated by any State organ, either *de jure* or *de facto*, of the FRY. Finally, the Court analysed whether these entities had acted under instructions, direction or control of the FRY.¹¹ It is this last question—the attribution of acts of entities acting under the instructions, direction or control—which is dealt with in the present Chapter.\n--- ⁷ See for instance: De Frouville (2010), pp. 265–271; Palchetti (2010) and Cassese (2007).\n⁸ ICJ, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*), Judgment, 26 February 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 207, para. 397.\n⁹ Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n¹⁰ Ibid., paras. 390–395.\n¹¹ Ibid., paras. 396–412.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors # 3 Diversity of Approaches on the Attribution of Acts Conducted Under the Instructions, Direction or Control of the State The ICJ, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Law Commission (ILC) have followed different approaches on the attribution of conduct of non-state actors acting under the direction, instructions or control of a State, which are analysed in the present section.\n# 3.1 The ICJ's Nicaragua Case and the\"Effective Control\"Test In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ applied two different tests to assess the degree of control of a State over a non-state actor: the\"strict control\"test and the\"effective control\"test. The first determines whether the non-state actor is a de facto organ of the State. The second, the\"effective control\"test, is a subsidiary test when the agency relationship of the first test cannot be proven.[12] The\"effective control\"test is generally considered to be a stricter approach for the purpose of the attribution of acts conducted by non-state actors under the instructions, direction or control of the State. These two tests have, however, two different objectives: the first one aims to qualify a person or a group as a de facto organ and attribute all their acts to the State; the second one aims not to determine an agency relationship but only to attribute some acts on a casuistic basis when these specific acts are conducted under sufficient control from the State.[13] The present subsection summarizes the Nicaragua case and describes how the Court developed the effective control test, which has been confirmed by the ICJ in its subsequent jurisprudence.[14] The Nicaragua case before the ICJ arose from the activities of the Contras, a movement of guerrilla insurgency initiated in 1981 against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The Contras were funded and assisted, covertly and overtly, by the United States. The Court found, inter alia, that the United States violated their obligations under customary international law to not intervene in the affairs of another State, to not use force against another State, and to not violate the sovereignty of another State.\nIn this case, the Court had to deal with the attribution question to determine whether the acts of the non-state actors supported by the United States were attributable to this State. It distinguished two situations arising from the facts of the case: [12] Milanovic (2006), pp. 577, 583; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[13] See, however, the contrary view expressed in Cassese (2007), p. 650.\n[14] The Court followed the same reasoning in two steps, first the\"strict control test\"and second the\"effective control test\"in both Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; and Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue firstly, persons supported, financed and armed by a State organ and acting under its control; secondly, persons armed and financed by a State but retaining a certain degree of independence in the conduct of their operations, as in the case of the Contras.[15] The ICJ had to first deal with a series of events not conducted by the Contras, but which Nicaragua alleged to be the direct action of either US military personnel or UCLAs.[16] These events, such as the mining of Nicaraguan ports or waters, involved, so Nicaragua claimed, the responsibility of the United States\"in a more direct manner\".[17] The Court focusing on some incidents established that: Although it is not proved that any United States military personnel took a direct part in the operations, agents of the United States participated in the planning, direction, support and execution of the operations.[18] Consequently, it appears that the participation of the agents of a State in the\"planning, direction, support and execution\"of acts is enough to hold this State responsible for these acts.\nSecondly, the Court had to determine whether all the conducts of the Contras were attributable to the United States. The Court started by analyzing whether the US was responsible for all acts of the Contras. The ICJ answered negatively, as it found that the Contras were not an organ of the United States.[19] The Court based its reasoning on the 'complete dependence' test, also called the 'strict control' test.\nAs the Contras were not an organ of the United States, the ICJ further enquired whether some of their acts were, nonetheless, attributable to the US. Indeed, the acts of non-state actors might be attributed to a State if they are conducted under a sufficient degree of control by this State.\nFor this purpose, the Court then used the subsidiary 'effective control' test, used by the ICJ when the requirements of the strict control test are not fulfilled.[20] This test does not seek to qualify a person or a group as the organ of a State, but rather to determine if a single act has been conducted under the effective control of a State and is thus attributable to this State. For the effective control test, a general degree of control or dependence of the group is insufficient; it is necessary to prove the effective control over each specific act concerned.[21] In the case under discussion, the Court had to determine whether the United States had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations of the Contras involving violations of human rights and humanitarian law. If so, then this would [15] Cassese (2007), pp. 642–655.\n[16] “UCLA” stands for “Unilaterally Controlled Latino Assets” and refers to “persons of the nationality of unidentified Latin American countries, paid by, and acting on the direct instructions of, United States military or intelligence personnel”. This acronym borrowed from the CIA’s vocabulary was used by the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 75.\n[17] Ibid.\n[18] Ibid., para 86.\n[19] Ibid., paras. 109–110, 115.\n[20] Milanovic (2006), p. 577; Talmon (2009), p. 502.\n[21] Talmon (2009), p. 502; Álvarez Ortega (2015), p. 11.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors give rise to legal responsibility on the part of the United States.²² The ICJ answered negatively, ruling that these violations of human rights and humanitarian law were the acts of the Contras that were not imputable to the United States.²³ To be imputable to the United States, this State should have “directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State”²⁴ which was not the case in this instance. Antonio Cassese commented on these two criteria of direction as follows: It seems clear from these words that by ‘effective control’ the Court intended either (1) the issuance of directions to the contras by the US concerning specific operations (indiscriminate killing of civilians, etc.), that is to say, the ordering of those operations by the US, or (2) the enforcement by the US of each specific operation of the contras, namely forcefully making the rebels carry out those specific operations.²⁵ In relation to the acts of the Contras, the ICJ had to deal with the attribution question a third and last time. Nicaragua claimed that the United States had violated the prohibition of the use of force by being engaged in the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding, and directing military and paramilitary actions in and against Nicaragua”.²⁶ In order to answer this claim, the Court had to determine whether the “recruiting, training, arming, equipping, financing, supplying and otherwise encouraging, supporting, aiding and directing” were sufficient conditions to render the acts attributable to the United States. The ICJ was ultimately asked to analyse whether the acts constituted a use or threat of force. The Court had to first determine whether the acts were attributable to a State, and then analyse if they constituted a violation of the prohibition of the use of force by this State. The ICJ distinguished two forms of support and ruled that the arming and training of a guerrilla group engaged in hostilities against another State could be defined as a threat or use of force, whereas the mere supplying of funds to this group could not: In the view of the Court, while the arming and training of the contras can certainly be said to involve the threat or use of force against Nicaragua, this is not necessarily so in respect of all the assistance given by the United States Government. In particular, the Court considers that the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua, as will be explained below, does not in itself amount to a use of force.²⁷ ²² *Nicaragua* (Merits) cit., para. 115.\n²³ Ibid., para. 116. The Court found, however, the United States responsible for their own conduct in relation to the Contras, constituting violations of the principle of non-intervention and of the sovereignty of Nicaragua.

Delerue The Court found that the US was responsible for their “arming and training” and, thus, their actions constituted an unlawful use of force by this State.\nTo conclude on the Nicaragua case, the “effective control” test developed by the Court is generally considered as a strict standard.²⁸ The reasoning developed along two tracks—firstly analyzing the “strict control” test and secondly applying the subsidiary “effective control” test—and it has been reused by the ICJ in its subsequent cases dealing with attribution of non-state actors’ acts to a State.²⁹ The approach developed in the Nicaragua case was also the basis of the ICTY’s reasoning in the Tadić case,³⁰ which will be developed in the following paragraphs.\n## 3.2 The ICTY’s Tadić Case and the “Overall Control” Test In the Tadić case, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY adopted another approach called the “overall control” test.³¹ This approach is generally considered to be looser and more flexible than the “effective control” test developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.³² The ICTY had to determine whether the conduct of a non-state actor was attributable to a State. The question was, however, not to determine the responsibility of a State for its conduct, but to identify the applicable law by determining whether an armed conflict was of an international or a non-international character.³³ This ²⁸ Klabbers (2013), p. 129.\n²⁹ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\n³⁰ ICTY, Trial Chamber, Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T; ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor vs Dusko Tadić (Judgment), Judgment of 15 July 1999, IT-94-1-A.\n³¹ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber), cit.; for the purpose of this Section we focus on the Appeal Chamber decision, the question of attribution has also been dealt with in the first instance of the case: ICTY, Tadić (Trial Judgement) cit.\n³² ICTY, Appeals Chamber, Prosecutor v.

What is at issue is a preliminary question: that of the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State. Logically these conditions must be the same both in the case: (i) where the court’s task is to ascertain whether an act performed by an individual may be attributed to a State, thereby generating the international responsibility of that State; and (ii) where the court must instead determine whether individuals are acting as de facto State officials, thereby rendering the conflict international and thus setting the necessary precondition for the ‘grave breaches’ regime to apply. In both cases, what is at issue is not the distinction between State responsibility and individual criminal responsibility. Rather, the question is that of establishing the criteria for the legal imputability to a State of acts performed by individuals not having the status of State officials. In the one case Attribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors divergence of objectives is one of the main bases for criticism of the approach adopted by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in the Tadić case.³⁴ In this case, the ICTY tried Duško Tadić, a Bosnian Serb, for numerous offences committed during 1992 at the Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje camps, and other locations in the Prijedor municipality in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the takeover of Prijedor and the attack launched against the town of Kozarac in 1992, non-Serb civilians were detained in these camps, where they were mistreated, sexually assaulted, tortured, and killed.\nThe Second Trial Chamber, and then the Appeals Chamber, had to determine whether the acts of Duško Tadić were in violation of Article 2 of the ICTY Statute.³⁵ This Article concerns “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”, and thus conducts during an armed conflict of an international character.³⁶ An international armed conflict existed between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the FRY until 19 May 1992, when the Yugoslav People’s Army withdrew from the former’s territory.³⁷ The Chamber thus had to determine whether after this date—that is when the examined conducts took place—the armed conflict was still of an international character or had taken on a non-international character. The Chamber famously ruled that “an armed conflict is international if it takes place between two or more States”,³⁸ and thus it had to determine whether the Bosnian Serb forces were de facto organs of FRY.³⁹ The Appeals Chamber decided to rely on the rule of State responsibility to examine the “notion of control by a State over individuals” acting as de facto organs, as these acts, if they prove to be attributable to a State, will give rise to the international responsibility of that State; in the other case, they will ensure that the armed conflict must be classified as international”).\n³⁴ It was for instance the case in the analysis made by the ICJ: Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n³⁵ Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (adopted by UNSC Res 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 amended by UNSC Res 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, Res 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, Res 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002 and Res 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002), Article 2 “Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949”: “The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention: (a) wilful killing; (b) torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; (c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; (d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; (e) compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; (f) wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian of the rights of fair and regular trial; (g) unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian; (h) taking civilians as hostages”.\n³⁶ ICTY, Tadić (Appeals Chamber) cit., para 80(i).\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 86.\n³⁸ Ibid., para. 84.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 87.\nF. Delerue IHL does not deal with this question.⁴⁰ The Chamber conducted an extensive and critical analysis of the approach adopted by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.⁴¹ The Chamber noted, however, that it does not hold the Nicaragua test to be “persuasive”,⁴² because it considers it to be, on the one hand, “unconvincing” on the grounds of “the very logic of the entire system of international law on State responsibility”,⁴³ and, on the other hand, “at variance with international judicial and State practice”.⁴⁴ It seems, however, that the Appeals Chamber based its analysis on a wrong interpretation of the effective control test of the Nicaragua case.⁴⁵ The ICTY refers notably to various cases to support this assertion: the Stepens case before the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission,⁴⁶ the Yeager case of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal,⁴⁷ the Loizidou v. Turkey case before the European Court of Human Rights,⁴⁸ and finally the Jorgić case before the Oberlandesgericht of Düsseldorf.⁴⁹ Some authors have, however, challenged the Chamber’s reading of these cases, and do not support its approach.⁵⁰ Ultimately, the Chamber decided to adopt its own approach, diverging from that of the ICJ.⁵¹ The Chamber examined the rationale of attribution to a State of the acts of private individuals and noted that “States are not allowed, on the one hand, to act de facto through individuals and on the other to disassociate themselves from such conduct when these individuals breach international law”.⁵² In the determination of the necessary degree of control for attribution, the Chamber ruled that it may vary according to the factual circumstances and the nature of the relationship.

Once it has been established that a State has overall control of an organized group, there is no need to analyse each specific act to render them attributable to the State.57 The effective control test is fulfilled if the State has equipped, financed, trained or provided operational support to the group; the overall control test integrates looser forms of control such as coordinating and helping in general in the planning of military or paramilitary activity.58 There are two parts in the test developed by the ICTY: on the one hand, “[t]he provision of financial and training assistance, military equipment and operational support”; and on the other hand, “[p]articipation in the organisation, coordination or planning of military operations”. This has been confirmed in subsequent jurisprudence of the ICTY.59 The ICTY confirmed, nevertheless, that the mere provision of assistance, be this military, economic or any other form, is not sufficient.60 The Appeals Chamber found that the conduct of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska was attributable to the FRY, and thus that the conflict was of an international character.61 This finding reverses that of the Trial Chamber, which applied the “effective control” test enunciated in the Nicaragua case by the ICJ and found that it was not a de facto organ and thus that the conflict was not of an international character.62 It appears that there has been a misunderstanding between the ICTY and the ICJ. The ICJ in the Nicaragua case developed two tests: the “strict control” test for F. Delerue the determination of agency relationship (as in Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility), and the ‘effective control’ test for the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven (as in Article 8). Thus, the second test, the effective control test, is not aimed at qualifying a *de facto* organ of a State.⁶³ The ICTY focused on the question of agency relationship and thus misinterpreted the “effective control” test and used it in the wrong context.⁶⁴ The “overall control” test developed by the ICTY focuses, indeed, on the same situation as the “strict control” test developed in the *Nicaragua* case, the determination of agency relationship, and not on situation where this test has already been answered negatively as for the effective control test of the ICJ. This confusion has, however, misled both the ICJ and the ILC, which refers to the “overall control” test in the context of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (attribution when the agency relationship was not proven),⁶⁵ and not in the context of Article 4 (agency relationship test) as it should be.⁶⁶ This confusion and its consequences necessitate an analysis of the “overall control” test in the context of both the determination of an agency relationship and the attribution of some acts when the agency relationship was not proven.⁶⁷ ## 3.3 The ILC Articles on Responsibility of States The ILC Articles on State Responsibility also deal with the attribution of acts to a State for the purpose of State responsibility. Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State”, reads: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.⁶⁸ The three alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction”, and “control” of the ILC differ from the *Nicaragua* and *Tadić* tests. The ILC’s approach seems less ⁶³ *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 397.\n⁶⁴ ICTY, Trial Chamber, *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadić* (Trial Judgement), Judgment of 7 May 1997, IT-94-1-T ‘Separate and Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mcdonald Regarding the Applicability of Article 2 of the Statute’, p. 288; see also De Hoogh (2002), p. 290; Milanovic (2006), p. 581; Griebel and Plücken (2008), pp. 612–613; Talmon (2009), p. 507.\n⁶⁵ *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) cit., para. 406; ILC (2001), p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 5.\n⁶⁶ Kreß (2001), p. 131; Talmon (2009), pp. 506–507.\n⁶⁷ The literature on cyber operations and international law has also misled by this confusion: Schmitt (2013), p. 32, commentary to Rule 6, para. 10; Woltag (2014), pp. 89–91.\n⁶⁸ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53rd session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Article 8.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors restrictive than the approach followed by the ICJ,⁶⁹ and has been considered as “a good compromise, in the sense that it is sufficiently vague to allow different interpretations”.⁷⁰ It appears, however, that the ILC favoured the “effective control” test of the ICJ over the “overall control” test of the ICTY.⁷¹ It must be noted that the ILC did not follow the distinction between, on the one hand, single individuals and unorganized groups, and on the other hand, organized groups, developed by the ICTY. Its approach applies, without distinction, to any individuals or groups.⁷² The ILC adopted the three disjunctive and alternative criteria of “instructions”, “direction” and “control”.⁷³ These criteria can actually be aligned in two categories, as noted in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility: “[t]he first involves private persons acting on the instructions of the State in carrying out the wrongful conduct. The second deals with a more general situation where private individuals act under the State’s direction or control”.⁷⁴ The instruction criterion is clearly the “effective control” and “specific instruction” tests developed by the ICJ and the ICTY. The direction and control criteria go beyond the ICJ’s approach but are not as broad as the ICTY’s overall control test. The degree of direction and control required depend on the facts of the complained conduct, and therefore need to be determined on a casuistic basis.\n## 3.4 The Armed Activities and Bosnian Genocide Cases: Restating the “Effective Control” Test After the Tadić case of the ICTY and the adoption of the 2001 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the ICJ examined this question on two more occasions: firstly, in 2005 in the Armed Activities case and; secondly, in 2007 in the Bosnian Genocide case.⁷⁵ In both cases, the ICJ based its reasoning on the Articles on State Responsibility, and reused the “effective control” test previously developed by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case.\n⁶⁹ Francioni (2011), p. 103; Milanovic (2009), pp. 309–310.\n⁷⁰ De Frouville (2010), p. 271; see however Cassese (2007), pp. 663–665.\n⁷¹ Milanovic (2006), p. 583.\n⁷² ILC (2001), p. 49, commentary to Article 8, para. 9.\n⁷³ Ibid., p. 48, commentary to Article 8, para. 7.\n⁷⁴ Ibid., p. 47, commentary to Article 8, para. 1.\n⁷⁵ Armed Activities (Judgment) cit.; Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit.\nF. Delerue ## 3.4.1 The Armed Activities Case In the Armed Activities case, the ICJ had to determine whether the conduct of the Congo Liberation Movement (MLC) was attributable to Uganda. In this case, only one paragraph deals with the question of attribution and the Court did not elaborate to any great extent on this question.76 The Court followed the same reasoning as in the Nicaragua case, analysing successively the two main aspects of attribution. Firstly, it analysed whether the MLC could be considered an organ of Uganda or an entity exercising elements of governmental authority on its behalf, on the basis of Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The first aspect being negative, it then looked at whether the conduct of the MLC was on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Uganda, on the basis of Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Court answered negatively to both questions and concluded that the conduct of the MLC could not be attributed to Uganda.77 In the context of the present study, the interest of this case is limited, as the Court did not develop to a large extent the question of attribution. It is, however, important to note that it analysed the attribution question without using or referring to the approach adopted in the Tadić case. The Court solely referred to its previous jurisprudence, namely the Nicaragua case.\n## 3.4.2 The Bosnian Genocide Case More recently, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ again reaffirmed the approach it adopted in the Nicaragua case. In this case, conversely to the Armed Activities case, the Court analysed the approach adopted by the ICTY in the Tadić case. It, however, discarded the overall control test and referred back to the effective control, previously used by the ICJ.78 In this case, the Court had to determine whether the massacres perpetrated at Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro.79 The Court determined that only the massacres committed by the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) at Srebrenica constituted acts of genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention.80 It had then to determine if these acts of the VRS were attributable to Serbia and Montenegro, the respondent in the case, and thus if this State was responsible for them. The Court noted on the attribution question that: This question has in fact two aspects, which the Court must consider separately. First, it should be ascertained whether the acts committed at Srebrenica were perpetrated by organs Attribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors of the Respondent, i.e., by persons or entities whose conduct is necessarily attributable to it, because they are in fact the instruments of its action. Next, if the preceding question is answered in the negative, it should be ascertained whether the acts in question were committed by persons who, while not organs of the Respondent, did nevertheless act on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent.[81] The Court analysed first whether the VRS was a de jure organ of Serbia and Montenegro, and answered negatively.[82] As pointed out above, it also considered whether it constituted a de facto organ of this State applying the\"complete dependence\"test developed in the Nicaragua case,[83] and again answered negatively.[84] As the VRS was neither a de jure nor a de facto organ of Serbia and Montenegro, the Court analysed whether the VRS was acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, this State.[85] The Court based its analysis on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility,[86] which enshrines the applicable norm of customary international law. The Court analysed the\"overall control\"test developed in the Tadić case, and found that the: logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues, which are very different in nature: the degree and nature of a State's involvement in an armed conflict on another State's territory which is required for the conflict to be characterized as international, can very well, and without logical inconsistency, differ from the degree and nature of involvement required to give rise to that State's responsibility for a specific act committed in the course of the conflict.[87] Moreover, the Court criticized the approach followed by the ICTY by saying that: It must next be noted that the\"overall control\"test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility: a State is responsible only for its own conduct, that is to say the conduct of persons acting, on whatever basis, on its behalf.[88] Consequently, the ICJ did not follow the\"overall control\"test, but decided to return to the approach it developed in the Nicaragua case: the\"effective control\"test. In this respect, the Court noted that\"it is on the basis of its settled jurisprudence that the Court will determine whether the Respondent has incurred responsibility [81] Ibid., para. 384.\n[82] Ibid., paras. 385–389.\n[83] Nicaragua (Merits) cit., paras. 109–110.\n[84] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., paras. 390–395.\n[85] Ibid., para. 397; the analysis of the question of attribution on the basis of direction or control is dealt with at paras. 396–412.\n[86] Ibid., para. 397; see the critical analysis of the reasoning of the Court on Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility in: Griebel and Plücken (2008). Marco Milanović criticized the interpretation made by these authors in Milanovic (2009).\n[87] Bosnian genocide (Judgment) cit., para. 405.\n[88] Ibid., para. 406.\nunder the rule of customary international law set out in Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility”. It concludes that there is not a sufficient factual basis to establish that the acts were conducted under the direction or control of the FRY.\n### Analysing and Navigating the Various Approaches The previous sections have described the various approaches adopted by the ICJ, the ICTY, and the ILC. These different approaches can be summarized as follows: any act conducted by any single individual, unorganized group or organized group under the specific instructions of a State for the perpetration of this very act, is attributable to this State; the ICJ, the ICTY and the ILC agreed on this point. This is the “effective control” test adopted by the ICJ and the “specific instructions” test adopted by the ICTY.\nConversely, the situation is more complicated when it comes to acts conducted without the specific instructions of a State. The three juridical institutions adopted divergent approaches. For the ICJ, the lack of effective control prevents the attribution of the conduct to a State, whether perpetrated by single individuals, unorganized groups or organized groups. In such circumstances, the ICTY determines whether the acts are conducted by organized armed groups, or, instead, by single individuals or unorganized groups. In the first scenario, an overall control over the organized group perpetrating the conduct is sufficient to attribute it to the State according to the ICTY; this is the overall control test developed in the Tadić case. Conversely, in the second scenario, an act perpetrated by single individuals or unorganized groups cannot be attributed to the State without its specific instruction; this complies with the ICJ approach.\nThe ILC seems to lean towards the second approach by using the alternative criteria of direction and control. It does not distinguish between conduct that is perpetrated by a single individual, an unorganized group or an organized group. Having a certain degree of control or direction over the perpetrator in relation to the conduct would be enough to attribute the conduct to the State.\nAttribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors # 4 Applying the Various Approaches to Cyber Operations State-sponsored cyber operations are often conducted by non-state actors. This situation triggers the question of attribution, and in particular how to attribute their conduct to the State. First of all, it is undisputed that the rules on State responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct.[92] Cyber operations, and more generally the ubiquitous character of the Internet, appear to be particularly challenging for the existing rules governing the law of State responsibility, and in particular attribution. I assert that, in some cases, the degree of control required by the ICJ might amount to a too high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.[93] We should also be wary, nevertheless, of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most appropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. The following paragraphs discuss the two principal reasons for this approach; the first concerns the use of the Internet in general, not solely concerned with cyber operations, and the second centres on cyber operations.\nFirstly, the Internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity with a lesser degree of organization. The cyber operations conducted in 1998 by various actors in support of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (ZANL) clearly illustrate this point. The Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), a group of cyber activists established in 1997 in the United States, and the Anonymous Digital Coalition (ADC), a group of political activists from Italy, conducted cyber operations against the US and Mexican governments in support of the ZANL. They did not only conducted these operations but they also designed them, made an online tool (FloodNet) available to conduct them, and called on any interested individuals to participate in their online actions. These actions were well coordinated with a low degree of organization. In a similar manner, the actions of Anonymous show how an unorganized group is able to conduct widespread coordinated cyber operations; the same can be said of the Russian Business Network.[94] These examples do not directly concern the question of whether the acts of non-state actors are attributable to a State. However, a State could just as easily coordinate cyber operations, and involve non-state actors in these actions, without necessarily having a very high degree of control over them. The State might then have a sufficient degree of control to achieve its goals without the risk of being held legally responsible for these acts, given the very high threshold that is required for attribution.\nSecondly, cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivize others to act. For instance, standard\"arming and training\"means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these F. Delerue weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved much more easily. Would posting online of a ready-to-use malware, or software, for the conduct of cyber operations, such as FloodNet, amount to “arming” the final users? This crude comparison between real arming and training and cyber arming and training might seem far-fetched, but the end result could easily be the same. Similarly, “training” might be carried out through online instructions. This example illustrates how analogous situations in the real world and in cyberspace might end up having divergent legal qualifications and effects.\nFinally, the lack of cooperation between States is an important challenge for the question of attribution involving any kind of cyber operation, and a fortiori when it involves alleged state-sponsored ones. In most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and human involved, as well as any sponsoring State, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes depend on the good will and cooperation of the foreign State. In the case of Estonia, for instance, the country made unsuccessful requests seeking Russia’s legal cooperation to assist with the identification of the perpetrators of the 2007 cyber attacks.⁹⁵ Unsurprisingly, no Russian perpetrators were thus identified, and the only perpetrator identified was an Estonian, Dmitri Galuškevits, who acted from Estonia’s territory. Estonian authorities were able to gather evidence that led to his identification and conviction.⁹⁶ The lack of cooperation constitutes an important challenge for the attribution of cyber operations.\nTo give a concrete illustration of the application of attribution in the realm of cyberspace where a State directs or controls individuals, we will now consider its application in the context of the 2007 cyber operations against Estonia.\n## 4.1 2007 Estonia DDoS Attacks The Estonian government accused Russia of being behind the 2007 cyber operations, but admitted that they had no actual evidence to prove Russia’s involvement.⁹⁷ However, members of a Russian movement acknowledged their involvement: Russia has consistently denied any involvement. Yesterday, however, Konstantin Goloskokov, a ‘commissar’ in the youth group [Nashi], which works for the Kremlin, told the Financial Times that he and some associates had launched the attack, which appears to be the first time anyone has claimed responsibility.⁹⁸ ⁹⁵ Tikk and Kaska (2010).\n⁹⁶ Harju County Court (Estonia), Dmitri Galuškevits, No. 1-07-15185, Judgment of 13 December 2007; Lindau (2012) and Ottis (2008).\n⁹⁷ RIA Novosti (2007).\n⁹⁸ Clover (2009).\nMoreover, Sergei Markov, a member of the Russian Parliament, confirmed that his assistant had carried out cyber operations against Estonia. Dmitri Galuškevitš, a 20-year-old Estonian from the Russian minority, has been the only perpetrator identified and convicted for the cyber operations that blocked the website of the Estonian Reform Party.\nThe following paragraphs will not discuss the question of the veracity of this claim, or the legal characterization of these cyber operations. The analysis will solely focus on establishing the necessary conditions to attribute these cyber operations by non-state actors to Russia.\nI will first briefly restate the facts. The cyber operations against Estonia can be divided into two phases: the first phase was predominantly “emotionally motivated” and took place from 27 to 29 April 2007; the second phase was more coordinated and sophisticated and lasted from 30 April to 18 May 2007. The first phase consisted mainly of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against governmental and media websites, coordinated through various online forums and chats. The second phase consisted in more coordinated and sophisticated cyber operations that had more harmful consequences. In the DoS attacks that were replaced by sophisticated DDoS attacks using large-scale and sophisticated botnets, the perpetrators rendered the question of attribution more difficult by using proxy servers in various countries and spoofing their IP addresses. In addition to DoS and DDoS attacks, cyber operations also took the form of defacement, targeting websites and comments, and email spamming.\nThe following deductive reasoning is based on the limited facts and information made publicly available and does not thus constitute a comprehensive or final analysis of the case. It seems clear that most of these cyber operations were carried out by non-state actors, supporting the Russian minority living in Estonia. A natural question to ask is: what degree of control would Russia have had to exercise over these cyber operations in order to be held responsible?\nThe cyber operations seem to have been coordinated through various online chats and forums. Consequently, the non-state perpetrators appear to be disorganized, and therefore do not constitute a single organized group. Instead, the perpetrators seem to be overwhelmingly single individuals or unorganized groups that decided to conduct cyber operations in support of a cause, which led them to collect information on the targets and develop means to conduct the online cyber operations.\nIf this were the case, it would be difficult to say that any one individual had effective control over all the cyber operations, and thus a fortiori to claim a State was exercising such control. This is a general conclusion given the nature and the variety of actors involved in these cyber operations. It does not preclude the consideration that some of those involved might have actually acted on the specific instructions from Russia.\nConsequently, it appears that the ICJ would clearly find that these cyber operations were not attributable to Russia because the effective control test would fail to be satisfied. The State obviously exercised a lesser degree of control than in the case where the State arms and trains, or even funds, the group. The ICTY would adopt the same approach concerning single individuals and unorganized groups. The first alternative criterion of “instruction”, formulated by the ILC, would clearly not be satisfied.\nTwo possible grounds for attribution remain unresolved: the attribution to organized groups on the basis of the “overall control” test of the ICTY, and the criteria of direction and control set down by the ILC. Concerning the overall control test, it encompasses a wider degree of control over the group without requiring specific instructions for each individual act; it could, for instance, refer to no more than funding. As noted already, we cannot axiomatically maintain that these perpetrators constitute an organized group; however, some of them might have belonged to organized groups. It seems that even in such a scenario, the degree of control is still too trivial. Indeed, even if Russia was actually behind some of the forums or chats inciting people to perpetrate these cyber operations, which it must be pointed out has not been established to date, and subsequently gave instructions on how to carry these acts, this form of control or direction appears to be clearly below the threshold of the “overall control” test and the ILC criteria.\nAs mentioned already, this analysis does not provide a comprehensive or final answer to the question of attribution concerning the cyber operations that were perpetrated against Estonia. It demonstrates, however, that even if more information and evidence were available, the attribution to Russia would be extremely difficult to establish under international law.\nThe degree of control necessary to encourage non-state actors to conduct cyber operations can, as has already pointed out, be particularly low. If States increasingly rely on cyber operations and ultimately a case is brought before an international court or tribunal, it seems plausible that the judges would ask the question whether a lower threshold should be necessary, or at least conceivable, in such scenarios. However, it is important to not lose sight of the risk of lowering the threshold too low, which would open the floodgates to excessively loose criteria for attribution that would result in misinterpretation and mistaken attribution.\n### Private Cybersecurity Companies The conduct of private cybersecurity companies can be attributed to a State on various grounds, notably if they are de facto organs of a State or permitted to exercise governmental authority. In such cases, all their acts are attributed to the State even if they are ultra vires. Most private cybersecurity companies may, however, fall outside these categories and thus their acts would not be automatically attributable to the State. When they are not de facto organs, some of their acts would be Attribution to State of Cyber Operations Conducted by Non-State Actors attributable if they are exercised under a certain degree of control of the State, as described above.\nThe question of private cybersecurity companies can be studied in conjunction with the broader notion of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs). PMSCs are increasingly employed by States to conduct functions previously exercised by armed forces, raising many legal questions.¹⁰² On the attribution of PMSCs' conduct to a State, the\"effective control\"test of the ICJ seems too restrictive. The\"overall control\"test of the ICTY seems conversely more appropriate. These problems have been raised by Francesco Francioni, who highlighted these two tests in the context of State's recourse to PMSCs: Under the Nicaragua test, a PMSC would engage the home state liability for a violation of human rights only if it was proved that, in conducting the specific activity which infringed a human right, the company or its employees were acting under the effective control of the home state. Under the Tadić test – also known as the Cassese test – it is sufficient that the home state maintains a general or 'overall' control of a political-military nature over the private military contractors, without being necessary that it has directed the specific commission of the wrongful act by the private actor.¹⁰³ When recruiting private actors to conduct cyber operations, States may only give instructions about the result while leaving it to the discretion of the private actors to decide on what type of cyber operation to execute. For instance, if a State asks the private actors to conduct cyber operations in order to disrupt and cause physical damage to a nuclear plant in another State, this situation may, according to the\"effective control\"test, be difficult to attribute to the State, whereas it would be attributable according to the\"overall control\"test. The alternative criteria of instructions, direction or control, as defined by the ILC, would make such conduct attributable to the hiring State.\n# 5 Conclusive Remarks Cyber operations conducted under the instructions, direction or control of a State may constitute one of the main categories, if not the main category, of State-sponsored cyber operations. As exposed in the present Chapter, the current international legal framework is applicable to the cyber realm; however, it is facing two important challenges. Firstly, the diversity of approaches on the attribution of acts conducted under the instructions, direction or control of the State, which may render the attribution process uncertain. Secondly, and most importantly, using overly strict criteria might make the attribution process particularly difficult in practice.\n¹⁰² See generally Lehnardt (2007), Tonkin (2011), Francioni and Ronzitti (2011), Bakker and Sossai (2012) and Tougas (2012).\n¹⁰³ Francioni (2011), p. 102.\nF.
