Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures\n# 1. Introduction\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as \"fourth-generation war,\" develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure\nA crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law (Gartzke, 2013). Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means (Schmmidt, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nRid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as \"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\" He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet (Gartzke, 2013)\nFinally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent (Gartzke, 2013).\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective\nOver the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector (Vianna, 2019).\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources:\n- a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams;\n- b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities;\n- c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n455\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group (WikiLeaks, 2014) and from Hacking Team (WikiLeaks, 2015) granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion (Rid, 2011). It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey (Cylance, 2014).\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies (Gross, 2016).\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore (Klijnsma, 2016).\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage (Cylance, 2018).\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation (McAfee, 2018).\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network (NPCIL, 2019).\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran (Richardson, 2011).\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center (US-CERT, 2018), in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities (US-CERT, 2018).\n458\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab (Kaspersky, 2017)2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky (Kaspersky, 2016) states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET (Cherepanov, 2016) reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data (US-CERT, 2017). It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace (Kaspersky, 2017) (Kaspersky, 2017a).\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped (Talos, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages (Greenberg, 2018).\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses (FireEye, 2018).\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n460\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims (Gartzke, 2013).\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases.

However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States.",
  "flat_text": "Eduardo Izycki¹ and Eduardo Wallier Vianna² ¹University of Brasília, University Campus – Ipol/Irel – Asa Norte, Brazil ²University of Brasília, Brazil, University Campus – FIS – Asa Norte, Brazil eduizycki@yahoo.com.br eduardo.izycki@aluno.unb.br eduardowallier@hotmail.com DOI: 10.34190/IWS.21.011 Abstract: This article aims to analyze belligerent actions in cyberspace, particularly against critical infrastructures (CI) of a nation-state. Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures # 1. Introduction Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as\"fourth-generation war,\"develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure A crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means.\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna Rid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as\"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\"He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet Finally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent.\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective Over the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector.\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources: - a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams; - b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities; - c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group  and from Hacking Team  granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion . It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey .\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies .\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore .\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage .\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation .\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network .\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran .\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center , in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities .\n\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab 2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky  states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET  reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data . It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace  .\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped .\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages .\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) .\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) .\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses .\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims .\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States.",

    "# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure A crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means.": "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna Rid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as\"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\"He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet Finally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent.\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.",
    "## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective Over the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector.": "Despite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources: - a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams; - b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities; - c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group  and from Hacking Team  granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion . It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey .\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies .\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore .\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage .\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation .\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network .\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.",
    "## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks": "We compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran .\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center , in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities .\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab 2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky  states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET  reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data . It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace  .\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped .\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages .\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) .\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) .\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses .\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims .\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.",
    "# 5. Conclusion": "In less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States."

Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures # 1. Introduction Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as\"fourth-generation war,\"develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure A crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means.\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna Rid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as\"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\"He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet Finally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent.\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective Over the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector.\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources: - a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams; - b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities; - c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group  and from Hacking Team  granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion . It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey .\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies .\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore .\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage .\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation .\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network .\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran .\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center , in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities .\n\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab 2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky  states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET  reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data . It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace  .\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped .\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages .\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) .\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) .\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses .\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims .\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States.",

Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures\n# 1. Introduction\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as \"fourth-generation war,\" develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure\nA crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law (Gartzke, 2013). Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means (Schmmidt, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nRid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as \"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\" He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet (Gartzke, 2013)\nFinally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent (Gartzke, 2013).\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective\nOver the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector (Vianna, 2019).\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources:\n- a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams;\n- b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities;\n- c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n455\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group (WikiLeaks, 2014) and from Hacking Team (WikiLeaks, 2015) granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion (Rid, 2011). It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey (Cylance, 2014).\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies (Gross, 2016).\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore (Klijnsma, 2016).\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage (Cylance, 2018).\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation (McAfee, 2018).\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network (NPCIL, 2019).\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran (Richardson, 2011).\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center (US-CERT, 2018), in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities (US-CERT, 2018).\n458\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab (Kaspersky, 2017)2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky (Kaspersky, 2016) states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET (Cherepanov, 2016) reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data (US-CERT, 2017). It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace (Kaspersky, 2017) (Kaspersky, 2017a).\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped (Talos, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages (Greenberg, 2018).\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses (FireEye, 2018).\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n460\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims (Gartzke, 2013).\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States."

Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures\n# 1. Introduction\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as \"fourth-generation war,\" develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure\nA crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law (Gartzke, 2013). Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means (Schmmidt, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nRid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as \"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\" He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet (Gartzke, 2013)\nFinally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent (Gartzke, 2013).\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective\nOver the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector (Vianna, 2019).\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources:\n- a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams;\n- b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities;\n- c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n455\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group (WikiLeaks, 2014) and from Hacking Team (WikiLeaks, 2015) granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion (Rid, 2011). It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey (Cylance, 2014).\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies (Gross, 2016).\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore (Klijnsma, 2016).\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage (Cylance, 2018).\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation (McAfee, 2018).\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network (NPCIL, 2019).\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran (Richardson, 2011).\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center (US-CERT, 2018), in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities (US-CERT, 2018).\n458\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab (Kaspersky, 2017)2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky (Kaspersky, 2016) states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET (Cherepanov, 2016) reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data (US-CERT, 2017). It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace (Kaspersky, 2017) (Kaspersky, 2017a).\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped (Talos, 2017).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages (Greenberg, 2018).\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) (Cherepanov, 2017).\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses (FireEye, 2018).\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n460\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims (Gartzke, 2013).\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States."

Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures # 1. Introduction Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\nCyberwar, also known as\"fourth-generation war,\"develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure A crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means.\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna Rid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as\"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\"He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet Finally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent.\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack. No further analysis concerning the persistence of the damage made, mainly because the information was not available for the cases we recorded.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of which sectors are classified as CI. Based on the research of Izycki and Colli (2019) we are able to state that most nation-states (58 out 86) regard CI as a strategic priority for national cybersecurity. It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI. Alternatively, some NCSS defined CI for the consequences associated with the malfunction or interruption of the services. Most countries indicated economic (21), security (20), and physical damage and/or loss of human lives (16).\nRather than relying on a textbook definition, we selected the sectors that are most frequently described as CI in NCSS. With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective Over the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector.\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources: - a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams; - b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities; - c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group  and from Hacking Team  granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\nSource: The authors\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion . It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\nSource: The authors\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey .\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies .\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore .\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage .\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation .\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network .\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran .\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center , in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities .\n\n## 4.3 Shamoon\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab 2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\nKaspersky  states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET  reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n## 4.5 NotPetya\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data . It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace  .\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped .\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages .\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n## 4.6 Industroyer\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) .\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) .\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses .\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n# 4.8 Analysis\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\nSource: The authors\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims .\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States."

It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means.\n\nEduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna Rid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as\"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\"He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists. Even if argued that a massive number of violations within cyberspace would constitute acts of war, it would be necessary to the victim nation to notify this behavior, something that has not happened yet Finally, he points out that the damage caused by cyber-attacks has been only temporary. He states that for it to reach the threshold of war, the kinetic effects would also have to be permanent.\nThough this is a critical discussion, for the sake of brevity, we adopted for this article the need for a kinetic consequence (at least, an intended one) to consider a cyber offensive action an armed attack.

It was the third most frequently observed objective in National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS).\nFrom that research, we can determine which services and facilities are most commonly classified as CI. The NCSS repeatedly mentioned the Energy (27), Telecommunications (26), Transport (25), Financial (21), and Water/Sewage (19) sectors as CI.

    "454\n\n# Critical Infrastructure: A Battlefield for Cyber Warfare?\n\nEduardo Izycki¹ and Eduardo Wallier Vianna²\n\n¹University of Brasília, University Campus – Ipol/Irel – Asa Norte, Brazil\n²University of Brasília, Brazil, University Campus – FIS – Asa Norte, Brazil\n\neduizycki@yahoo.com.br\neduardo.izycki@aluno.unb.br\neduardowallier@hotmail.com\n\nDOI: 10.34190/IWS.21.011\n\nAbstract: This article aims to analyze belligerent actions in cyberspace, particularly against critical infrastructures (CI) of a nation-state. Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (&lt;6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.\n\nKeywords: cyberspace, cyber-attacks, cyber warfare, critical infrastructures\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing the world both for positive and adverse consequences. There is a new sense of insecurity and the fear of unconventional conflicts.\n\nIn this new strategic context, the nation-state loses its monopoly over the war itself, where the opponent may not be an organized state, but any other non-state actor (a terrorist group or a criminal organization).\n\nCyberwar, also known as \"fourth-generation war,\" develops in an artificial environment – cyberspace. Created by man, cyberspace is characterized by high complexity, resulting from the interaction of people, with an infrastructure of technology and communication networks, composed of hardware, software and services. Supported by the world wide web (Internet), cyberspace has many of its effects concretely felt in the real world, not limited to informational and cognitive aspects (Vianna &amp; Fernandes, 2015).\n\nAs the main methodological strategy of this exploratory study, surveys and data analysis were performed by means of natural language processing (Python 3 - NLTK) and extensive use of regular expressions (RegEx).\n\nThe present work aims to analyze belligerent actions, particularly against critical and strategic infrastructures of a nation-state. We intend to demonstrate that CI are high-value assets for nation-states, but they are only attacked by 07 campaigns. Even less frequent is the intent to cause physical consequences through the cyberattack.\n\n# 2. Cyber-attacks, cyber war and critical infrastructure\n\nA crucial point to define is the delimitation of what constitutes cyberwar. It is a contested concept to which no consensus has yet emerged. It is unclear if due to the lack of cases where the actors are publicly accountable for their actions – hence the problem of attribution – or the time-consuming effort to solidify legal standings in international law (Gartzke, 2013). Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that if a cyber-attack physically destroys facilities or, at least, injures people, it would allow the victim-state the right to self-defense by cyber or kinetic means (Schmmidt, 2017).",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nRid goes even further, pointing out that cyberwar should be regarded as \"a potentially lethal, instrumental, and political act of force conducted through malicious code.\" He stresses that cyber-attacks, so far, fall into the categories of subversion, sabotage, or espionage due to the lack of violence unleashed (2011).\n\nGartzke argues that the violation of sovereignty is an act of war in cyberspace. However, a host of actors sends malicious packets crossing many borders, including spies, criminals, and hacktivists.

With these parameters, we established what targets considered as CI for our research. In the next section, we searched over 1,300 documents for attacks that produced (or intended to) kinetic effects against CI targets.\n\n## 3. Cyber-attacks - historical perspective\n\nOver the last decade, several incidents cyber-attacks were heavily publicized by the media. Vianna recalls the case of Georgia, addressing and strengthening the thesis of the hybrid war with effects on civilians (IHL). It refers to 2008 Russia's military incursion, where cyber-attacks served as multipliers of fighting power, targeting financial institutions, private companies, and government websites from Georgia. That incident was also used to maximize a purely economic target, such as Georgian ports and facilities in the oil and gas sector (Vianna, 2019).\n\nDespite numerous references to cyber-attacks in the mainstream media, there is almost no technical analysis to support the stories. They are often the product of human sources that disclose details about a cyber-attack (attribution and the level of compromise). However, without backing it up with evidence, a story can be told to entail a political purpose, whether to be detrimental to the victim or the alleged author.\n\nThereby, in order to evaluate cyber-attacks in an accurate historical perspective, this article sought for objective and reliable data concerning cyber-attacks. The goal was not depending on traditional news, but technical reports that could withstand a rigorous analysis. As a result, this article gathered data from threeprimary sources:\n\n- a) technical reports by cybersecurity vendors and national incident response teams;\n- b) independent studies by Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) and universities;\n- c) information leakage suffered from private vendors of spyware.\n\nThe three different sources of information provide insight into distinct features of cyber-attacks.\n\n455",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nThe first two describe sophisticated campaigns, frequently referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). They display detailed information about long-term campaigns conducted or sponsored by Nation-States against other countries. The data provided by these documents are strong evidence for evaluating how many attacks targeted critical infrastructure.\n\nFor this article, we gathered 1,322 reports describing cyber-attacks from 2008 to 2019. We grouped them into campaigns or groups to whom the attacks were attributed, which resulted in 625 campaigns/groups. We achieved this by following the steps of Roth (2019), MISP (2019), and Mitre Foundation (2019).\n\nThis dataset was analyzed with Natural Language Processing to look for attribution (whether it was state-executed, state-sponsored, or a non-state actor), information on the victim (government, CI or industry targeted) and, whenever available, the nationalities of the affected targets. The overall results display 638 reports where some level of attribution was possible (country of origin or group affiliation identified with a medium degree of confidence). In 267 documents, the origin was linked to 26 different countries as a direct or sponsored attack.\n\nIt is worth mention that 993 technical reports ( $\\approx 75.1\\%$ ) are from western entities. Hence, there is a bias towards portraying most of the victims as western and attributing as authors countries that are not from those regions.\n\nThe remaining sources provide evidence on Nation-States' acquisition of cyber offensive capabilities. Two leaks from Gamma Group (WikiLeaks, 2014) and from Hacking Team (WikiLeaks, 2015) granted unprecedented access to the restricted market of cyber weapons. It was possible to identify 88 different countries that acquired cyber weapons.\n\nFurther analyzing the dataset for cyber-attacks against CI, we sought in the documents for reference as targets: Energy (Electrical, Nuclear, et cetera), Telecommunications, Transportation, and Water/Sewage. These sectors were chosen based on the research of Izycki and Colli(2019) that found the most recurring CI among eighty-six NCSS.\n\nWith one caveat, though the financial sector is the fourth most recurring segment classified as CI within the NCSS, it was not included. The reason is that all the 133 documents refer exclusively to it as targets for criminal purposes (e.g., for the profit) and not to produce kinetic effects, which is the scope for this article.\n\nConsidering the six sectors, we found only 87 documents ( $\\approx 6.5\\%$ ) that report some facilities classified as CI. Table 1 illustrates the distribution of reports among the sectors.\n\nTable 1: Documents that report CI attacks\n\n|  Oil and Gas | 37 | 2,80%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Electricity/Energy | 31 | 2,34%  |\n|  Nuclear | 21 | 1,59%  |\n|  Telecom Providers | 19 | 1,44%  |\n|  Transportation | 18 | 1,36%  |\n|  General Mention to CI | 18 | 1,36%  |\n\nSource: The authors\n\nSome of the reports described cyber-attacks against more than one CI sector. Therefore, the total amount of documents (172) in the middle row of Table I surpasses the number of reports concerning CI.\n\nThere are significant differences between the effects of cyber-attacks. In 28 documents ( $\\approx 32.1\\%$ ), the actions describe intended or achieved kinetic effects or destruction of information hosted by the target. In contrast, the remaining 59 documents specify actions to perform reconnaissance or extract information (e.g., espionage, intellectual property theft).",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nFollowing the strict definition of an armed attack, only 28 reports fit into the concept of an armed attack inflicted against CI targets. The vast majority refer to actions that would easily fit the concept of espionage or subversion (Rid, 2011). It is possible to argue that some of these actions – i.e., collecting information on a CI target – could be classified as a preparatory step towards an armed attack, because they did not produce kinetic effects because cybersecurity measures prevented them.\n\nWe grouped the 28 reports into seven campaigns in Table 2:\n\nTable 2: Campaigns against CI with physical consequences/intentions\n\n|  Campaign | Starting Year | Attribution | Countries Affected | Targets  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | 2010 | US and Israel | Iran | Uranium enrichment plants  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | 2015 | Russia | Switzerland, US, Turkey and Ukraine | Electricity, nuclear, water supply and aviation sector  |\n|  Shamoon | 2016 | Iran | Saudi Arabia | Aramco and Saipem S.p.A.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine | Electricity distribution network  |\n|  NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | Ukraine, but with global effects | Finance, transportation, energy, and healthcare  |\n|  Industroyer | 2017 | Non-attributed (Russia) | Ukraine | Electrical substations  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | 2017 | Russia | Saudi Arabia | Oil companies  |\n\nSource: The authors\n\nBecause of the premise of this research, we excluded a few notorious campaigns in the next level of analysis. They are as follows:\n\n- Operation Cleaver – started in 2012 and was attributed to Iran by Cylance (2014). The main targets were CI companies in the energy, oil and gas sectors in Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, US, France, England, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, and Turkey (Cylance, 2014).\n- Dust Storm – the operation migrated in 2015 from a traditional government and defense-related targets to compromise victims across the following industry verticals: electricity generation, oil and natural gas, finance, transportation, and construction. In 2016 the group's focus shifted to target Japanese companies (Gross, 2016).\n- Mofang – it was a Chinese state-sponsored campaign, focused on Myanmar's government and CI, from February 2012 to 2015, with collateral targets in Germany, Canada, South Korea, US, India, and Singapore (Klijnsma, 2016).\n- Poking the Bear – described as a three-year campaign that targeted a state-owned Russian oil company by a non-state actor with the ultimate goal of obtaining financial advantage (Cylance, 2018).\n- Sharpshooter – it was a global scale job recruitment within CI segments, likely to gather information for monitoring and future exploitation. The company also suggests that several techniques to the Lazarus Group (North Korea) seem too obvious, which might hint to a false-flag operation (McAfee, 2018).\n- Soft Cell – active at least 2012, the campaign targeted global telecommunications providers by a state-actor affiliated with China (Intrusion Truth, 2018). The goal was to collect personal information, billing data, call records, credentials, email servers, and geo-location of users (Levi, Dahan, &amp; Serper, 2019).\n- Lyceum Group – the group has been active since 2018, targeting sectors of strategic national importance (oil and gas, telecommunications). The company suggests that the tradecraft displayed resembles the Iranian groups OilRig and APT33 (Dell Secureworks, 2019).\n- Kudankulam nuclear plant – the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) public admitted that on September 4th, 2019, it was identified a malware in the plant. The company stated that the infected computer was an administrative asset, which is isolated from the critical internal network (NPCIL, 2019).\n\nThe handful of cases is strong evidence of how unusual an attack against CI is. Furthermore, out of that small number, only a few attacks intended to produce concrete results to impact the CI operation. In the next section,",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nwe will proceed to provide some context regarding each case in order to compare them further to search for patterns.\n\n## 4. CROSS comparison of cyber-attacks\n\nWe compared the attacks that targeted CI assets or facilities in this section regarding technical details, such as protocols and devices targeted, the complexity of tools that leveraged to conduct the cyber-attack, and to whom they were attributed.\n\nOne expected outcome is to identify similarities and patterns among the different campaigns. With it, we will better understand attacks on CI and its consequences in international relations between nation-states.\n\n## 4.1 Stuxnet\n\nStuxnet is one of the most notorious APTs in history. It is credited as a joint operation (Olympic Games) between the US and Israel against the uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz plant in Iran (Richardson, 2011).\n\nAccording to Clarke and Knake (2015), Stuxnet was first recognized, in the second half of 2010, by the control systems specialist (ICS – Industrial Control System) Ralph Langer as a large, complex, and sophisticated cyber weapon, created to render Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges inoperative. The nuclear facilities were located in the city of Natanz and had a robust security apparatus (including anti-aircraft defense). According to the authors, Stuxnet attacked the Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA system, which monitored and sent instructions to hundreds of Iranian centrifuges. When the worm, when infecting the monitoring and control system, sent altered commands to the electric motors, creating an oscillation that ended up breaking almost a thousand centrifuges (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n\nThe impacts caused by Stuxnet on the SCADA system, used in Iranian nuclear installations, were so significant, that it even received the nickname of \"first\" cyberwar weapon already used successfully (Farwel &amp; Rohozinski, 2011).\n\nTo this day, the Stuxnet attack is still considered one of the most sophisticated (known) cyber-attacks ever. Due to the vast array of components used, which includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first-ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion techniques, sophisticated process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface (Matrosov et al, 2011).\n\n## 4.2 Dragonfly\n\nSymantec (2014) states that the Russian attackers responsible for Dragonfly started their activities in 2011 against American and Canadian defense and aviation companies. As of 2013, there was a migration to attacks against industrial automation systems of electricity companies in the USA and Europe. The primary victims were Spain, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Serbia. According to Symantec (2017), a second version of the main artifact used by the group, called Dragonfly 2.0, was observed from the end of 2015. The main attackers in this second generation were the USA, Switzerland, and Turkey.\n\nRecently, the US Incident Handling Center (US-CERT, 2018), in March 2018, and the National Cyber Security Center (2018), in April 2018, issued alerts about new attacks that would be being carried out by Dragonfly against entities government, electricity sector, nuclear sector, water supply, aviation and industrial production considered critical.\n\nThe attack harvested NTLM 1 credentials via Server Message Block (SMB) using strategic web compromises and spear-phishing (National Cyber Security Centre, 2018). NTLM is an authentication protocol that is used on networks running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems. Once access on the network has been secured, the attacker tries to pivot between several machines using harvested credentials, penetration testing, and network administration tools.\n\nThe forensic analysis of the US Cert indicates that on multiple occasions, the attackers accessed workstations and servers from which it was possible to see the output from control systems within energy generation facilities (US-CERT, 2018).\n\n458",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\n## 4.3 Shamoon\n\nThe Shamoon attacks were attributed to Iran. IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) stated it occurred in November 2016 and January 2017, affecting thousands of computers across multiple government and civil organizations in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in Gulf states. The purpose of the malware was to destroy computer hard drives by wiping the master boot record (MBR) (IBM X-Force, 2017).\n\nAt the beginning of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab (Kaspersky, 2017)2017b observed a new campaign towards multiple targets in the Middle East. The company assesses that the malware used in this campaign was a variant of Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and RasGas (Qatari company) back in 2012.\n\nDuring the next waves of the campaign, an Italian oil company called Saipem confirmed that they experienced a cyberattack that involved a variant of the Shamoon malware. The attack caused infrastructure and data availability issues, forcing the organization to carry out major restoration activities. Some estimates claim that the new Shamoon Campaign damaged 300 systems on Saipem's network.\n\n## 4.4 BlackEnergy\n\nKaspersky (Kaspersky, 2016) states that BlackEnergy is a trojan created by hacker Cr4sh to enable remote access in 2007, having been in denial-of-service attacks against Georgia in 2008. It would have returned to activity in a more sophisticated fashion in 2014, against industrial control and automation services.\n\nIn the second stage of the cycle, a Russian APT used BlackEnergy to target several entities related to the government of Ukraine and Poland. The actions reflected politically oriented attacks in convergence with cyber espionage actions.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (2016) indicates that the attacks that occurred on December 23, 2015, carried out against the Ukrainian electricity distribution network, were caused by BlackEnergy, interrupting the energy supply of more than 225,000 people. Furthermore, ESET (Cherepanov, 2016) reports the use of BlackEnergy in a campaign conducted against Ukrainian media entities, close to the electoral period in that country, intending to destroy image files and videos to influence the election politically.\n\nThis case highlights the concern over the application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack that interrupts energy supply during winter for over 200 hundred thousand civilians could be classified as disproportional even in the face of a military target at sight.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the BlackEnergy APT leveraged at least one zero-day, alongside destructive tools, to target industrial control systems. In contrast, according to Recorded Future, most of the components of the source code are available for purchase or download on the internet (Recorded Future, 2016).\n\n## 4.5 NotPetya\n\nNotPetya is also one of the most notorious malwares in history. Of Russian origins, it was first seen in a global campaign that started in June 2017. The main objective was to obliterate data on-disk structures. The malware presented itself in a shape of ransomware, however soon became clear that the attackers never intended to receive a ransom to unencrypted data (US-CERT, 2017). It was later that no key even existed to decrypt the information of the victim's computer\n\nNotPetya also contained worm-like features to propagate itself across a computer network using the NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalRomance (SMBv1). In this new mash-up, leaked code from the Shadow Brokers – an alleged hacktivist group – culminated in the creation of a worldwide menace (Kaspersky, 2017) (Kaspersky, 2017a).\n\nThe attack first began in Ukraine, on a national scale it hit four hospitals in Kiev, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, and reached every federal agency. The Ukraine Ministry of Infrastructure claimed that at least 300 companies were hit, and official estimates stated that close to 10 percent of all computers in Ukraine were wiped (Talos, 2017).",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nAmong the victims of the worm were hospitals, maritime-transport Maersk, pharmaceutical Merck, FedEx's European subsidiary, a French construction company (Saint-Gobain), and a food producer Mondelèz. In an ironic turnaround, the malware eventually spread back to Russia, damaging the state oil company Rosneft. According to a White House assessment, the result of the campaign is estimated in more than $10 billion of total damages (Greenberg, 2018).\n\nThis case highlights displays how a cyber-attack can promote the widespread incidental civilian harm (IHL) given the global and interconnected nature of cyberspace.\n\n## 4.6 Industroyer\n\nCherepanov (2017) and Dragos (2017b) reported on the Russian APT, known as Industroyer (CrashOverride), that targeted electricity substation in Kyiv, Ukraine. The action resulted in the interruption of the electricity supply through the interruption of physical industrial control processes.\n\nThe most striking aspect of this malware is the depth of technical knowledge demonstrated by the authors of the tool in the industrial protocols used in electrical systems. The use of these protocols is a specific knowledge, which suggests that highly specialized labor was necessary to make this artifact, whose specific target is a family of relays (Siemens SIPROTEC) (Cherepanov, 2017).\n\nThe attacks revealed support for four different industrial protocols: IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) (Cherepanov, 2017).\n\nThe kinetic effects that malware can perform are considered significant. Compared to the artifacts used to cause the electrical blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 (BlackEnergy), both cybersecurity companies consider the sophistication of the Industroyer attack remarkable as it allows control over switches and circuit breakers.\n\nAn additional aspect, presented by Dragos (2017), is the possible reuse of Industroyer in distribution networks from other countries since the artifact is agnostic concerning a specific hardware provider or configuration. In this sense, the idea that a third-party may leverage the sophistication of this campaign to target another country is a demonstration of the complexity of the cyber threat environment worldwide.\n\n## 4.7 Triton/Trisis\n\nFireEye (Johnson et al, 2017) and Dragos (2017) reported on Triton/Trisis; it focused on safety instrumented system (SIS) – Triconex, manufactured by Schneider Electric. This equipment is present in many industrial segments. However, the knowledge necessary to produce kinetic consequences, through an attack, requires details of the implementation of the equipment in the specific case, which makes this attack not scalable.\n\nAccording to FireEye (Reese &amp; Miller, 2018), the activity registered is consistent with preparatory actions by a national state, although they were not able to attribute authorship at first. The targeted equipment has a proprietary communication protocol – it is not easily accessible – which imposed the reverse engineering of the protocol to the attacker or acquisition of a model for study.\n\nDuring multiple attempts, the attackers tried to send commands to the equipment in production; even in the face of failure, the campaign persisted. The series of attempts indicates that the intention of the attack was to interrupt the industrial process and to compromise the target's functioning, possibly surreptitiously, so that the operators would not even notice the attack in progress (Johnson et al, 2017)\n\nIn October 2018, FireEye attributed with a high level of confidence the Triton/Trisis attack to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) from Russia. That conclusion was based on the testing environment of the malware, behavior patterns consistent with the Moscow time zone, and the knowledge and personnel that CNIIHM possesses (FireEye, 2018).\n\nLater on, April 2019, FireEye disclosed another targeted attack by the Triton/Trisis, one that used commodity intrusions tools and did not display behavior associated with espionage. The malicious actor intended to perform\n\n460",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and persisting in the environment. Finally, it also assessed that the actor has been active since at least 2014 (Reese et al, 2019).\n\n# 4.8 Analysis\n\nThe seven campaigns do not follow a unique pattern. According to cybersecurity companies, the cases of Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer are similar to each other and likely come from the same Russian group, called Sandworm.\n\nThe fact that attacks against CI explore different protocols is due to the different architecture found at their targets. Since there are many providers of the programmable logic controller (PLC), and they are assembled differently, there is no single malware that can be used against all CI facilities.\n\nHowever, the intense presence of industrial control systems (ICS) accessible to the internet has created several potential entry points for attacking CI. That has made possible the use of commodity malware available in the underground markets as an entry vector.\n\nAnother advantage is the possibility of disguising himself by using popular tools; this idea reflects the concept of living-off-the-land. An additional benefit is mimicking different known APT groups in order to confuse the complex process of attribution further.\n\nIn contrast, the required knowledge on protocols of PLC, often proprietary, indicates that any cyber threat does not quickly reproduce this. The cases of Stuxnet and BlackEnergy leveraged at least one zero-day vulnerability, and the cases of Industroyer and Triton/Trisis were described as highly sophisticated use of industrial control protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the attacks were attributed to a small set of actors, Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In all cases, the relation between the attacker and the target is a reflection of notorious geopolitical strife:\n\n- The Stuxnet can be understood as a preemptive strike by the US and Israel against the Iranian nuclear program.\n- Dragonfly, BlackEnergy, NotPetya, and Industroyer all fall into the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\n- Shamoon was an Iranian attack design to cripple the strategic assets of Saudi Arabia.\n- Triton/Trisis is attributed to Russia but remains open regarding clear geopolitical interpretation.\n\nIn Table 3, there are the main features of the seven cyber-attacks against CI that were analyzed above.\n\nTable 3: Documents that report CI attacks\n\n|  Campaign | ICS Protocols/Devices | Characteristics/Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stuxnet | Siemens Simatic S7-300 (Siemens WinCC-7 SCADA) | Zero-day exploits, PLC rootkit, and a command and control interface.  |\n|  Dragonfly 2.0 | Siemens and Rockwell Automation | Mimikatz, SMB, web compromises, watering-hole domains, spear-phishing.  |\n|  Shamoon | - | Powershell, RDP Brute Forcing, SMBv1, spear-phishing, Pupy RAT.  |\n|  BlackEnergy | ABB PCM600, GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC | Spear-phishing, Rustock, Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, Dropbear SSH.  |\n|  NotPetya |  | SMBv1, Mimikatz, EternalBlue, EternalRomance  |\n|  Industroyer | Siemens SIPROTEC – IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, IEC 61850, and OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA) | Denial-of-Service capabilities  |\n|  Triton/Trisis | Triconex (Schneider) | Mimikatz, SecHack, PLINK  |\n\nSource: The authors\n\nThe frequency of attacks against CI is increasing over the years. The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) already manifested great concern over CI, stating that \"states should not conduct or knowingly",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nsupport ICT activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure\" (United Nations, 2015). Thus, the sophistication and escalation of cyber-attacks constitute a common issue for nation-states.\n\nWith the data presented, we established that attacks on CI are not typical and require specific technical knowledge to be accomplished. What makes the threat against CI feasible, but not widespread among threat actors. So far, only state-sponsored attacks were able to accomplish concrete effects.\n\nFurther, none of the alleged authors officially admitted the attacks; quite the contrary, they were denied. It is a setback for the classification as armed attacks since the concept of political conflict assume that force is used to achieve strategic advantage. So far, CI has not been targeted to elicit concessions from the victims (Gartzke, 2013).\n\nThe UN GGE report (2015) represents some level of agreement regarding the exclusion of CI as a target during peace-time. However, the strategic value that CI's have for the perpetrators explains the cover actions. It is likely, though, that without some clarification regarding the consequences of cyber-attacks against CI (i.e., trigger self-defense), the offenses' volume tends to increase.\n\nThe strategic ambiguity could be a deliberate action from States. By withholding that CI's are not targets during peace-time, States try to dissuade an attack through a broad non-coercive consensus and covertly engage in campaigns to practice cyber offensive capabilities preparing for future conflicts.\n\nAnother credible explanation is that States are not billiard balls, and the incoherence is due to domestic politics. Some entities within them are gravely concerned about being victims (CI private operators, civilian authorities) while cyber-related branches (military and/or intelligence agencies) see CI's as a strategic target.\n\nFurther studies comparing the national cyber strategies and cyber-attacks are needed to test these two hypotheses.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nIn less than 30 years, cyberspace evolved from innovation to an essential global asset. However, its mere existence enables new forms of attacks against CI.\n\nThrough the collection of 1,322 APT reports, we identified 87 documents that described attacks against CI. Only seven recorded campaigns intended or produced kinetic effects.\n\nThe seven campaigns were attributed to Iran, Israel, Russia, and the US. In their initial infection, they counted on tools available on black markets. In contrast, the campaigns explored different industrial protocols to achieve their goals, which denotes a high level of customization from ordinary offensive tools. Thus, to accomplish a CI cyber-attack, it is necessary to have the capacity to modify malware and to use it against specific industrial protocols, a set of skills not abundantly available.\n\nThe decision to launch this kind of attack is not trivial since there are considerations over IHL to ponder. Though a CI facility may be a legitimate target for a cyber-attack, there are issues to be considered. There is concern about individuality and proportionality because, in most cases, CIs serve both military and civilians.\n\nThose reasons might explain why no country has claimed official authorship for perpetrating kinetic attacks against CI. Nation-states are exhibiting restraint with this type of cyber-attack because decisive attribution could provide the victim with the right of self-defense. It is difficult to reconcile the concept of cyber warfare with anonymous attacks over the internet, as Rid and Gartzke stated.\n\nAs the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities amounts, the likelihood of an attack against it also increases. Hence the protection of CI is a collective concern that countries share. We emphasize that countries must further multilateral debate to address it at the UN GGE or any similar forum.\n\nThe evidence gathered in this research suggests that currently, CI's are a target only for covert cyber-attacks. So far, countries are reluctant to concede that they attacked CI publicly, probably due to concerns over providing",
    "Eduardo Izycki and Eduardo Wallier Vianna\n\nthe victim with the right of self-defense and IHL. However, existing precedents, aggravated with the growing distribution of cyber offensive capabilities and the absence of explicit cyber norms regarding the consequences of those actions, are likely to increase the risks associated with CI's targeting by Nation-States.\n\n## References\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton.

    "abstract": "This article aims to analyze belligerent actions in cyberspace, particularly against critical infrastructures (CI) of a nation-state. Given the dual nature of CIs, this issue closely relates to the exercise of cyber capabilities and International Humanitarian Law. In the Section 2, we discuss key concepts as the thresholds for a cyber-attack to be considered an armed attack according to International Law. In Section 3, we address the most frequent targets for cyber conflicts based on historical analysis of over 1,300 documents. Among those, we identified eighty-seven (<6.5%) reports, grouped into seven campaigns between 2010 and 2019 that targeted CI with kinetic purposes or producing concrete effects. The low number of attacks demonstrates that cyber-attacks rarely scale up to this level. In the third section, we engage in a cross-comparison of the seven campaigns against CI attributed to state actors. Conversely, no nation-state officially claimed to have authored the actions. The comparison also demonstrated that attacks against CI are not frequent and require specialized knowledge to target industrial control systems. We conclude that as the number of countries with cyber offensive capabilities increases, we expect that attacks against CI also expand, and as a result, the risk of kinetic attack on CI becomes more likely. Thus, setting explicit cyber norms on the subject is a collective concern that countries share and should engage in a multilateral debate to address it.",
