Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\n\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\n\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\n\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.",

This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\n\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.⁴\n\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\n\n⁴Florian J.

Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\n\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\n\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.",

But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation.⁵ In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\n\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\n\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\n\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\n\n⁵Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.",

At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\n\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\n\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n\n6 Garrett Derian-Toth et al., \"Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations,\" Tallinn Paper No. 12, Tallinn Papers Young Scholars Edition (Tallinn, Estonia: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2021), https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2021/08/Tallinn_Papers_Attribution_18082021.pdf.",

As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\n\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\n\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\n\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\n\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.",

Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading.⁷ (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\n\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\n\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\n\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\n\n⁷Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.",

Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\n\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns.

This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\n\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\n\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\n\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D.

When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other.¹³ But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\n\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets.¹⁴ In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable.¹⁵ Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations.

The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.",

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\n¹Dan McWhorter, \"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\" February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n²Michael S.

A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nCorrespondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts. \"Public su yuan\" means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.⁴\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\n⁴Florian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1 (January 2020), pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\npolitical, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation.⁵ In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\n⁵Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nevidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n6 Garrett Derian-Toth et al., \"Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations,\" Tallinn Paper No. 12, Tallinn Papers Young Scholars Edition (Tallinn, Estonia: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2021), https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2021/08/Tallinn_Papers_Attribution_18082021.pdf.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\npublic attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nreputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading.⁷ (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\n⁷Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nunderstood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel.⁸ In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.⁹\nLast but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated\n⁸Some officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration.

This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n[11] James A.

When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other.¹³ But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets.¹⁴ In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable.¹⁵ Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber\n¹² Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n¹³ Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n¹⁴ Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n¹⁵ James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\ndouble standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive.

Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis, \"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\" CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n17 National Intelligence Council, \"Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections,\" Intelligence Community Assessment, March 10 (Washington, DC: Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2021), https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf.\n$^{18}$ U.S. Department of Justice, \"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\" December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related.¹⁹ A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions.²⁰ This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.²¹\nThough these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries.

For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report.[22] In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution\nBeijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest\n22Michael S.

The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\n# Conclusion\nIn cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace.",

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

More than one year later, the United States Justice Department's indictment of five Chinese army officers for their alleged involvement in the economic espionage exposed in the Mandiant report marked a major escalation in the fight between the two great powers over cyber theft.\nSince then, publicly accusing China of purported cyber activities that threaten US economic interests and national security has become a US policy priority. Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\nDan McWhorter, \"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\" February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\nMichael S.

A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nCorrespondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts. \"Public su yuan\" means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\nFlorian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1 (January 2020), pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\npolitical, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation. In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nevidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\npublic attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nreputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading. (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\nJordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nunderstood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel. In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.\nLast but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated\nSome officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration.

This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n[11] James A. Lewis, “Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021, https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nFor example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned of possible Chinese and Russian influence operations in the run-up to US elections.\nAs Beijing sees it, the above three motivations are contradictory and create confusion. When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other. But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets. In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable. Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber\n Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\ndouble standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive.

Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis, \"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\" CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n\n$^{18}$ U.S. Department of Justice, \"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\" December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related. A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions. This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.\nThough these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries.

For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report.[22] In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution\nBeijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest\n22Michael S. Schmidt and David Sanger, \"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\" The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\ngroups' influence, and the lack of evidentiary standards have made public attribution a major hurdle to Chinese-US cooperation in cyberspace. The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\n# Conclusion\nIn cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace.",

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

More than one year later, the United States Justice Department's indictment of five Chinese army officers for their alleged involvement in the economic espionage exposed in the Mandiant report marked a major escalation in the fight between the two great powers over cyber theft.\nSince then, publicly accusing China of purported cyber activities that threaten US economic interests and national security has become a US policy priority. Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\nDan McWhorter, \"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\" February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\nMichael S.

A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nCorrespondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts. \"Public su yuan\" means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\nFlorian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1 (January 2020), pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\npolitical, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation. In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nevidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\npublic attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nreputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading. (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\nJordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nunderstood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel. In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.\nLast but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated\nSome officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration.

This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n[11] James A. Lewis, “Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021, https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nFor example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned of possible Chinese and Russian influence operations in the run-up to US elections.\nAs Beijing sees it, the above three motivations are contradictory and create confusion. When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other. But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets. In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable. Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber\n Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\ndouble standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive.

Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis, \"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\" CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n\n$^{18}$ U.S. Department of Justice, \"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\" December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related. A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions. This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.\nThough these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries.

For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report.[22] In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution\nBeijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest\n22Michael S. Schmidt and David Sanger, \"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\" The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\ngroups' influence, and the lack of evidentiary standards have made public attribution a major hurdle to Chinese-US cooperation in cyberspace. The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\n# Conclusion\nIn cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace.",

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

More than one year later, the United States Justice Department's indictment of five Chinese army officers for their alleged involvement in the economic espionage exposed in the Mandiant report marked a major escalation in the fight between the two great powers over cyber theft.\nSince then, publicly accusing China of purported cyber activities that threaten US economic interests and national security has become a US policy priority. Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\nDan McWhorter, \"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\" February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\nMichael S. Schmidt and David Sanger, \"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\" The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nWashington's increased use of public attribution and Beijing's relative passivity reflect their differing perceptions of the divisive issue. A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nCorrespondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts. \"Public su yuan\" means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\nFlorian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1 (January 2020), pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\npolitical, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation. In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nevidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\npublic attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nreputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading. (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\nJordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nunderstood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel. In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.\nLast but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated\nSome officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration.

This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n[11] James A. Lewis, “Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021, https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nFor example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned of possible Chinese and Russian influence operations in the run-up to US elections.\nAs Beijing sees it, the above three motivations are contradictory and create confusion. When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other. But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets. In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable. Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber\n Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\ndouble standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive.

The alleged evidence it presented only revealed that certain Chinese hackers had been probing the computer networks of US vaccine makers for possible bugs. $^{18}$  The glaring inconsistency between charges and evidence exaggerated China's cyber threat, imposed enormous reputational costs, and undermined Beijing's confidence in bilateral cooperation amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nnon-governmental attribution creates even greater confusion. Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis, \"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\" CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n\n$^{18}$ U.S. Department of Justice, \"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\" December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related. A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions. This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.\nThough these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries. Continued Western public accusations, many of which are flawed and\n Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, \"Significant Cyber Incidents,\" November 5, 2021, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents.\n Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\n Sebastian Moss, \"Apple Denies Chinese Spy Chip Claims in a Letter to US Congress,\" Data Centre Dynamics, October 8, 2018, https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/apple-denies-chinese-spy-chip-claims-letter-us-congress/.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nill-grounded, will only deepen bilateral strategic distrust and the Chinese public's disapproval of Western media.\nAs some Chinese analysts see it, even if the US government did not support non-official public attributions, it has acquiesced to them. For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report.[22] In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution\nBeijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest\n22Michael S.

The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\n# Conclusion\nIn cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace."

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\n¹Dan McWhorter, \"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\" February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n²Michael S. Schmidt and David Sanger, \"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\" The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nWashington's increased use of public attribution and Beijing's relative passivity reflect their differing perceptions of the divisive issue. A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution\nIn the Chinese context, \"attribution\" corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin, \"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\" Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nCorrespondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts. \"Public su yuan\" means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations. \"Public gui yin\" refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast, \"public su yuan\" is mostly a technical activity, while \"public gui yin\" has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.⁴\nThe first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical,\n⁴Florian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1 (January 2020), pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\npolitical, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation.⁵ In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution\n⁵Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nevidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with \"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue\nPublic attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though\n6 Garrett Derian-Toth et al., \"Opportunities for Public and Private Attribution of Cyber Operations,\" Tallinn Paper No. 12, Tallinn Papers Young Scholars Edition (Tallinn, Estonia: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2021), https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2021/08/Tallinn_Papers_Attribution_18082021.pdf.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\npublic attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers,\nor cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less\nAlthough Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nreputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading.⁷ (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely\n⁷Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nunderstood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel.⁸ In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.⁹\nLast but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated\n⁸Some officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration. See: Ellen Nakashima and Joby Warrick, “Stuxnet was Work of U.S. and Israeli Experts, Officials Say,” *The Washington Post*, June 2, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html.\n⁹Byron Acohido, “NSA Chief Alexander Defends PRISM, Deflects Hecklers,” *USA Today*, July 31, 2017, https://www.usatoday.com/story/cybertruth/2013/07/31/nsas-alex-anders-defends-prism-deflects-hecklers/2604533/.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nmove to name and shame the accused government. This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution\nBeijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage. Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack. Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n James A. Lewis, “Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021, https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nFor example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned of possible Chinese and Russian influence operations in the run-up to US elections.¹²\nAs Beijing sees it, the above three motivations are contradictory and create confusion. When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other.¹³ But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets.¹⁴ In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable.¹⁵ Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber\n¹² Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n¹³ Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n¹⁴ Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n¹⁵ James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\ndouble standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive. The United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence released two reports in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. The first one warned of possible Chinese\nGiven the divergences on public attribution between China and the United States, Beijing believes more dialogues and consultations may be more effective in bridging\ninterference through cyber operations, $^{16}$  while the second one recanted the first's claims. $^{17}$  As Beijing sees it, irresponsible US actions have tarnished China's international image. In another example, the United States Justice Department claimed that China had stolen US data on COVID-19 vaccines. The alleged evidence it presented only revealed that certain Chinese hackers had been probing the computer networks of US vaccine makers for possible bugs. $^{18}$  The glaring inconsistency between charges and evidence exaggerated China's cyber threat, imposed enormous reputational costs, and undermined Beijing's confidence in bilateral cooperation amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nnon-governmental attribution creates even greater confusion. Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis, \"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\" CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n17 National Intelligence Council, \"Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections,\" Intelligence Community Assessment, March 10 (Washington, DC: Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2021), https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf.\n$^{18}$ U.S. Department of Justice, \"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\" December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\nThe motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related.¹⁹ A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions.²⁰ This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.²¹\nThough these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries. Continued Western public accusations, many of which are flawed and\n¹⁹ Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, \"Significant Cyber Incidents,\" November 5, 2021, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents.\n²⁰ Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, \"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\" Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\n²¹ Sebastian Moss, \"Apple Denies Chinese Spy Chip Claims in a Letter to US Congress,\" Data Centre Dynamics, October 8, 2018, https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/apple-denies-chinese-spy-chip-claims-letter-us-congress/.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\nill-grounded, will only deepen bilateral strategic distrust and the Chinese public's disapproval of Western media.\nAs some Chinese analysts see it, even if the US government did not support non-official public attributions, it has acquiesced to them. For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report. In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution\nBeijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest\n22Michael S. Schmidt and David Sanger, \"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\" The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1\ngroups' influence, and the lack of evidentiary standards have made public attribution a major hurdle to Chinese-US cooperation in cyberspace. The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability:\n(1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution\n# Conclusion\nIn cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace."

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.\nLu Chuanying is a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), China.

Federal departments, cybersecurity firms, industry groups, think tanks, and media outlets have all released their accounts of Beijing's so-called malicious cyber operations, portraying the different aspects of a threat that is growing in scale and scope. In stark contrast, to date, China's government has not launched or engaged in any public cyber attribution, except in the case of Edward Snowden's revelations, when Beijing joined others to condemn Washington's extensive government surveillance scheme.\n¹Dan McWhorter,\"APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units,\"February (Reston, VA: Mandiant, 2013), https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n²Michael S.

A closer examination of the factors driving the two great powers' different approaches will deepen our understanding of public attribution as a foreign policy instrument and its implications for the broader bilateral relationship. A better understanding of the issue may also help move Beijing and Washington closer to some consensus or norms regarding cyber stability.\nThis paper attempts to deeply discuss the problems faced by public attribution from the perspectives of the attributing side and the attributable side, combined with the practices of China and the United States in this field. The next section gives a general introduction to the concept and procedure of cyber attribution, followed by an analysis of the securitization trend of cyber attribution. The third section focuses on Chinese-US divergences in public attribution. The paper will also conclude with suggestions on how China and the United States can strengthen dialogue and cooperation on public attribution.\n## Concepts and Procedures for Public Attribution In the Chinese context,\"attribution\"corresponds to the two different phrases of su yuan (淘源) and gui yin (扫因). The meaning of the first phrase su yuan is to find out the initiator of cyber operations, including machines, people, and organizations. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, it is very difficult to trace the source of covert malicious cyber operations. When launching a cyber attribution, the attributor generally needs to find the following three elements: (1) the device (the computer that initiates the cyber operation), (2) the person (the operator of the device), and (3) the organization (the person's funding agency). The meaning of the second phrase gui yin emphasizes the determination of the main responsible party of a malicious cyber operation and the responsibility of the perpetrator. Perpetrators can be individuals (hacktivists), NGOs (hacking groups), and states (government-owned/supported organizations and individuals).\n3Herbert Lin,\"Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents,\"Hoover Working Group on National Security, Technology, and Law, Aegis Series Paper No. 1607, September 26 (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution, Stanford University, 2016), https://lawfareblog.com/attribution-malicious-cyber-incidents.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 Correspondingly, when it comes to public attribution, in the Chinese context, there are also two different concepts.\"Public su yuan\"means releasing the investigation results of cyber operations to the public, emphasizing the source information of malicious cyber operations, including the attack techniques used, the affected targets, the consequences, and the losses suffered. This whole process requires exceptional technical capabilities. To raise awareness, hacktivists or cybersecurity companies often publicly release investigative reports about malicious cyber operations.\"Public gui yin\"refers to proactively releasing investigation results to the public, emphasizing the determination of responsibility for malicious cyber operations. The implementing subject is usually the victim of a cyberattack. Some perpetrators have taken the initiative to claim responsibility for the cyberattack to the outside world. Therefore, by contrast,\"public su yuan\"is mostly a technical activity, while\"public gui yin\"has the attributes of political attribution in many cases, which is easy to cause disputes between countries.\nGovernmental public attribution mainly involves three types of cyber operations, (1) cyber intelligence gathering; (2) cyberattacks that disrupt critical infrastructure; and (3) cyber influence operations of political interference. Governmental public attribution actually includes two steps, the first step is the derivation of the attribution conclusion and the second step is the publishing of information.⁴ The first step in attribution is the derivation of the attribution conclusion, which emphasizes on the attribution process. The anonymity, transnationality, and virtuality of cyber technology increase the difficulty and challenge of technology attribution. Therefore, the process of attribution is extremely complicated, and the results need to be deduced on the basis of comprehensive research and judgment of various technical information and intelligence. If a cyber incident causes heavy losses to the country or even affects national security, the government of the victim country will usually initiate an immediate investigation. Attribution conclusions are very important, which can be seen as the basis for subsequent decision-making, and a prerequisite for counteractions, including technical, ⁴Florian J. Egloff, “Contested Public Attributions of Cyber Incidents and the Role of Academia,” *Contemporary Security Policy*, Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 55–81, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2019.1677324.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution political, economic, diplomatic, and legal actions. Due to the technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities involved, the investigation process is carried out within several relevant departments and is a superimposed process of digital forensics, incident response data collection, and intelligence analysis. Based on the different political goals, attribution investigations need to be attributed to the machines, people, and organizations that initiated malicious cyber operations. The purpose of such investigation is to draw attribution conclusions and identify the perpetrators. Due to the anonymity of cyberspace, the multi-stage remote implementation of cyberattacks, and the continuous renovation of cyber tools, including the fact that perpetrators often use false information to cover up traces or even eliminate traces, cyber attributions are very difficult. In addition, drawing an attribution conclusion is a derivation process, even though the conclusions of attribution analysis of internal organizations are usually presented in a probabilistic form.\nInformation release is a process of political decision-making. After the attribution conclusion is drawn, it is first necessary to decide whether to disclose the attribution conclusion. Many factors need to be weighed. Then, determine the specific plan for specific information release, including the way of information release, the content of disclosure, the subject of disclosure, etc. Determine the specific form and content of public attribution based on the political goals to be achieved. There are two core contents of the decision; one is whether to publicly attribute the responsibility for cyber incidents to specific countries, while the other is how to release the attribution investigation results to the public.\nGenerally, these attribution reports are published by cybersecurity companies and government departments, while occasionally, they can also be released by civil society and industry. So there are various parties taking attribution investment including governments, corporations, NGOs, and academia. While various non-state actors have some degree of attribution capability and are willing to share their findings with the public, attribution claims from governments are especially important in published form. The government usually uses departmental documents, including indictments, joint diplomatic statements, and research reports. Cybersecurity companies mostly use technical reports or industry reports. Whether or not a high-profile attribution statement is issued, the information released has a strong direction to the perpetrators.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 The content of an attribution report generally consists of two parts, the relevant evidence and/or the attribution statement. But initially, when states issued attribution claims, they often did not release evidence of attribution on the grounds of national security. For example, after the Sony hack in 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially blamed North Korea for the attack but did not release information on its investigation.⁵ In the public attribution campaign launched by the United States, because the case of many cyberattacks eventually entered the judicial process, the United States Department of Justice released a large amount of ex-parte investigative evidence.\nSince attribution claims are often controversial and questionable, in order to increase the credibility of attribution conclusions, published content gradually tries to present more and more investigative information, mostly technical details of digital forensics. Occasionally, some countries (Switzerland, attributed to the NotPetya ransomware) choose to only disclose detailed technical reports, do not publish attribution conclusions, and do not (publicly) attribute responsibility to a country when making public attributions, but as long as the published attribution reports have a strong direction to the perpetrators, they can also achieve the purpose to a certain extent, and prevent the tension between the countries.\nHolding attackers accountable is one of the purposes of public attribution. But from the existing public attribution events, there are almost no cases where the attribution party accepts and approves the attribution results. Therefore, many officials and scholars have questioned whether public attribution can effectively prevent cyberattacks. Apart from this, the existing international law is also difficult to be used to resolve disputes between the attributor and the accused state. In many cases, the attributor can only hold the accused state accountable through unilateral sanctions. Of course, this could easily lead to political disputes and even escalate the situation.\nUnilateral sanctions involve sanctions imposed by the attributor on the accused country, institutions, and individuals. Unlike the physical world, the lack of international rules in cyberspace has led to disputes between the attributor originator and the accused ones over whether the attribution ⁵Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Update on Sony Investigation,” December 19, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution evidence is reliable and the purpose is clear. At present, the attributor generally takes unilateral actions to sanction the accused country. These actions mainly include the following: First, shaming (naming and shaming) through constant exposure, so as to achieve the purpose of punishment. The second is to punish the attributable country through cross-domain sanctions and use political, economic, and other sanctions as the consequence of public attribution. The third is to punish relevant countries by technological decoupling and censoring companies in attributable countries through means such as cybersecurity reviews and national security reviews. These methods do not have clear goals and clear boundaries, and it is very easy to cause generalization of security.\nIn terms of sanctions against institutions and individuals, judicial prosecution is the main sanction method, and at the same time, technical countermeasures will be supplemented. For example, the US government has charged Chinese companies with\"intellectual property theft\", prosecuted them, and imposed economic sanctions. In some cases, the attribution-initiating country will also take technical measures to counterattack its opponents. For example, the United States Cyber Command's suppression of the Russian Internet Research Agency has resulted in the inability to access the Internet for a certain time.\n## Public Attribution: An Emerging International Security Issue Public attribution, as it relates to cyberspace, is a recent phenomenon whose purposes, effectiveness, and consequences are the subject of heated debate. Most countries — including those with formidable cyber capabilities like China, France, and Russia — have refrained from explicitly and publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific foreign state-affiliated actors. Many of the most high-profile public accusations by governments have so far been made by the US-led Five Eyes intelligence alliance (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, and the United States) against major ideological adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.6 Though China Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 public attributions of cyber intrusions have increased in the last decade, calling out foreign cyber actors and holding their governments accountable remains a limited policy tool preferred only by a small number of countries because the attribution process is fraught with problems.\nFirst, besides the accusing and the accused parties, public attribution involves multiple cyber actors whose roles, motivations, and behavioral patterns are difficult to ascertain. As a new contested issue in great power competition, public attribution has drawn a significant amount of popular and media attention. Initiators of public attribution can be either government entities or non-governmental actors that specialize in cyber affairs. Government agencies make accusations against other governments or their proxies for what is described as a state-sponsored malicious cyber intrusion. Non-governmental accusers may include cybersecurity companies, media outlets, think tanks, or victims of cyberattacks who make attributions for their reasons or on public interest grounds. On the receiving end of public attribution could be nation-state governments, state-backed hackers, or cybercriminal gangs. Indiscriminate treatment of the diverse actors involved in public attribution has generated considerable discord and cast the effectiveness of the practice into question.\nGovernment-initiated attributions are more serious and rigorous processes involving considerable amounts of technical and operational information. If public attributions are followed by criminal charges, governments will release even more details to buttress the evidence. In some cases, the accused may raise legitimate questions about evidentiary integrity when the accuser chooses to withhold key information to protect its intelligence sources and methods.\nNon-governmental attributions are more problematic. Cybersecurity companies usually rely on threat intelligence, technical releases, and databases to bolster their cases. Some of them may be capable and prudent, but the less Although Beijing understands Washington's growing concern about increasing malicious cyber operations, it finds that the United States' government-backed attribution campaigns have only contributed to escalating tensions in cyberspace.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution reputable ones may also exaggerate to advertise their attribution capabilities. Accusations initiated by the media and think tanks are generally less convincing as these entities are less technically capable and may need to rely on data or claims provided by others. In some instances, the evidence they have produced has been flawed and misleading.⁷ (That said, some think tanks and journalists have become adept at open-source intelligence analysis, and journalists have sometimes conducted valuable on-the-ground investigations.)\nSecond, there is little agreement on evidentiary standards between the attributor and the accused. The search for perfect proof is futile for several reasons. To begin with, cyber forensics is much more difficult than real-world investigations because cybercrimes are virtual and, in many cases, transnational. From the accused state's point of view, the prevailing model of public attribution — associating a cyber intrusion with a state-sanctioned hacking group — has not been convincing enough. When the attributor withholds critical details to protect sources, the accusations invite doubt.\nThen there is the problem of legitimacy and credibility. Unlike in real-world court trials, where cross-checking and cross-examination are possible, public attributions of cyberattacks are usually a one-way street; the effective plaintiff's accusations are met with the defendant's resistance and denial. The accused will invariably question the validity of whatever allegedly impeccable evidence the accuser presents.\nPublic attribution, whether to governments or hacking groups, imposes reputational costs on the accused. Like a defendant in court, the accused will scrutinize every piece of information along the chain of evidence for any possible flaws. If public attribution implicates a foreign state's intelligence agency, the government on the receiving end of the accusation will likely not admit to the charges no matter how compelling the evidence may be. No country has ever acknowledged its intelligence services' involvement in any kind of cyberattack. Washington has never admitted responsibility for the infamous Stuxnet and Flame cyber operations that are widely ⁷Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley,\"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\"Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 understood to be part of a broader collaborative effort, known as Operation Olympic Games, between the United States and Israel.⁸ In the early days of the PRISM scandal, the United States National Security Agency’s director downplayed the nature and scope of the government surveillance program at a congressional hearing.⁹ Last but not the least, power asymmetry also creates differing perceptions of public attribution. Western attributors — particularly the United States — lead the world in terms of intelligence and Internet capabilities. Washington can bolster its cases with information and services provided by Internet companies, domain name system organizations, and financial agencies within its territory. The accused state, with no ready access to such information and services, may come to a different conclusion. The attributor may call out the accused for the latter’s hypocrisy as the accuser believes that the presentation of evidence, no matter how convincing or how substantial, does not change the factual reality of the intrusions and the culpability of the accused. In some cases, the accused would deny the accusation but quietly stop the cyber operations. But presenting persuasive evidence is still necessary — if evidence becomes optional, the threshold for public attribution will be lowered, making it no different from non-governmental attribution. Audiences will need to learn which attributors are more trustworthy and which attributors are less trustworthy.\nThird, the accused has difficulty in fathoming the motives behind public attribution. Compared with the accuser, the accused lags in attribution capabilities and experience, and may struggle to understand why the accuser has chosen to go public when existing open channels of communication could be used to express the accuser’s concerns. As the accused sees it, public attribution is an exercise in coercive diplomacy, a calculated ⁸Some officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, admitted such actions were first developed during the George W. Bush administration. See: Ellen Nakashima and Joby Warrick, “Stuxnet was Work of U.S. and Israeli Experts, Officials Say,” *The Washington Post*, June 2, 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html.\n⁹Byron Acohido, “NSA Chief Alexander Defends PRISM, Deflects Hecklers,” *USA Today*, July 31, 2017, https://www.usatoday.com/story/cybertruth/2013/07/31/nsas-alex-anders-defends-prism-deflects-hecklers/2604533/.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution move to name and shame the accused government. This perception may further undermine the accused state's confidence in bilateral dialogue on cyber issues.\nMoreover, the accused may wonder if there are ulterior motives behind the public attributions. As there are no widely agreed international norms of cyber operations, why would the United States accuse others of conducting cyber intelligence activities that Washington has never renounced? While the US government may choose to attribute cyber intrusions that it describes as threatening the US national security, news outlets tend to portray cyber operations as irresponsible and illicit followed by moralistic lecturing.\n# Chinese-US Divergences on Public Attribution Beijing is also struggling to understand Washington's strategic rationale for public attribution. The United States is the world's leading proponent and practitioner of public attribution but, as Beijing sees it, Washington lacks both consistency and clarity in purpose and tactics.\nThree motivations seemingly drive the US public attribution campaign against China. First, Washington aims to establish cyber norms of acceptable behavior — for example, certain targets should be off-limits for cyber intrusions. Beijing and Washington agreed in 2015 that cyber operations should not be conducted to gain commercial advantage.[10] Developing cyber norms also means making cyber operations more professional, as some American cyber experts proposed to reduce backdoors in cyber operations after the Microsoft Exchange hack.[11] Second, Beijing thinks that the US public attributions are a prelude to follow-up measures such as indictments and sanctions against alleged Chinese perpetrators. Third, Washington may choose to make public accusations for political purposes.\n[10] Gary Brown and Christopher D. Yung, “Evaluating the US-China Cybersecurity Agreement, Part 1: The US Approach to Cyberspace,” *The Diplomat*, January 19, 2017, https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/evaluating-the-us-china-cybersecurity-agreement-part-1-the-us-approach-to-cyberspace/.\n[11] James A. Lewis, “Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2021, https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 For example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned of possible Chinese and Russian influence operations in the run-up to US elections.¹² As Beijing sees it, the above three motivations are contradictory and create confusion. When it comes to developing cyber norms, Beijing insists that it has adhered to the bilateral consensus; US accusations, in some cases, have amounted to a unilateral stretch of the consensus regarding cyber norms. Beijing hopes to sign a more extensive agreement that commits both to refrain from cyber operations against each other.¹³ But Washington views cyber operations as a sovereign right it will never renounce, leading Beijing to believe that Washington wants to circumscribe China's cyber operations while preserving its freedom of action in cyberspace.\nPublic attribution on domestic legal grounds is also problematic. States conduct cyber operations to collect intelligence, not for criminal purposes. In practice, the United States cites domestic laws to justify legal actions against intelligence-gathering cyber operations. For example, when the Justice Department indicted five Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges, it cited such US legal provisions as 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(2)(c), §1030(a)(5)(A), and §1030(b), which concern computer fraud, theft of personal identities, economic espionage, and theft of trade secrets.¹⁴ In international law, cyber espionage is considered legally dubious while mainstream views maintain that it is acceptable.¹⁵ Cyber operations conducted under the so-called responsible state behavior framework may not be in line with the US domestic law but are not inconsistent with international obligations. US accusations that China has violated bilateral consensus are seen in China as unjustified and the United States' moralistic lecturing only exposes its cyber ¹² Philip Ewing, “Election Security Boss: Threats to 2020 are Now Broader, More Diverse,” npr, January 22, 2020, https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/798186093/election-security-boss-threats-to-2020-are-now-broader-more-diverse.\n¹³ Dongxiao Chen, Chuanying Lu, Haiyong Sun, and Xudong Jiang, “Competition without Catastrophe: A New China-U.S. Cybersecurity Agenda,” Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, February 2021, http://www.siis.org.cn/Report/3656.jhtml.\n¹⁴ Legal Information Institute, “18 U.S. Code §1030 — Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” 2021, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030.\n¹⁵ James Crawford and Simon Olleson, The Nature and Forms of International Responsibility (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 415–449.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution double standard, as Washington engages in cyber operations of a similar nature.\nAs for public attribution as a kind of prewarning, Beijing regards it as even more irresponsible and counterproductive. The United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence released two reports in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. The first one warned of possible Chinese Given the divergences on public attribution between China and the United States, Beijing believes more dialogues and consultations may be more effective in bridging interference through cyber operations, while the second one recanted the first's claims. As Beijing sees it, irresponsible US actions have tarnished China's international image. In another example, the United States Justice Department claimed that China had stolen US data on COVID-19 vaccines. The alleged evidence it presented only revealed that certain Chinese hackers had been probing the computer networks of US vaccine makers for possible bugs. The glaring inconsistency between charges and evidence exaggerated China's cyber threat, imposed enormous reputational costs, and undermined Beijing's confidence in bilateral cooperation amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nnon-governmental attribution creates even greater confusion. Non-governmental actors like cybersecurity firms and news outlets feel even less constrained in making public accusations against China.\n16James Andrew Lewis,\"Toward a More Coercive Cyber Strategy,\"CSIS Report, March 10 (Washington, DC: Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, 2021), https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-more-coercive-cyber-strategy.\n\n U.S. Department of Justice,\"Congressional-Executive Commission on China, Annual Report, 2020,\"December (Washington, DC: Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1366421/download.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 The motivations that drive their attributions are even more complicated and diverse, making the process even more flawed. The media tends to broaden public attribution into a smear campaign using naming and shaming tactics. It also tries to sway public opinion and government policy by portraying Beijing as a growing malicious cyber actor. Chinese observers believe cybersecurity firms usually exaggerate cyber threats in public attribution to market their capabilities for commercial gains.\nNon-governmental attributions are also fraught with problems. US print and online media have published no shortage of threat assessments that associate Chinese hackers with cyber activities backed by the Chinese government. A report by the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies examined over 800 cyber incidents and described more than 200 of them as China-related.¹⁹ A number of these news reports made public accusations without presenting any evidence; some are pure hearsay and do not stand up to scrutiny. A Bloomberg article in October 2018 reported that China had planted spyware in Supermicro products to facilitate cyber intrusions.²⁰ This widely circulated article later turned out to be built on disputed claims, as one of Supermicro's business partners, Apple, wrote a letter to the United States Congress, calling the story false.²¹ Though these accusations may not have been sanctioned by the US government, they have hurt China's reputation nonetheless by dragging Beijing into a dilemma of sorts. If China chooses to refute and debunk every unfair charge against it, it would have to devote considerable attention and resources. If it chooses to ignore them, the accusers may feel emboldened and double down on public attribution. China's international discursive power lags far behind that of the United States and other Western countries. Continued Western public accusations, many of which are flawed and ¹⁹ Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies,\"Significant Cyber Incidents,\"November 5, 2021, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents.\n²⁰ Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley,\"New Evidence of Hacked Supermicro Hardware Found in U.S. Telecom,\"Bloomberg, October 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom.\n²¹ Sebastian Moss,\"Apple Denies Chinese Spy Chip Claims in a Letter to US Congress,\"Data Centre Dynamics, October 8, 2018, https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/apple-denies-chinese-spy-chip-claims-letter-us-congress/.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution ill-grounded, will only deepen bilateral strategic distrust and the Chinese public's disapproval of Western media.\nAs some Chinese analysts see it, even if the US government did not support non-official public attributions, it has acquiesced to them. For example, sometimes media attributions have cited government officials to bolster their cases. In many high-profile accusations, government actions followed media revelations, like the indictment of the five officers in the wake of the 2013 Mandiant report.[22] In another example, the US government forged a partnership with the private sector in the run-up to the 2020 election to guard against possible external interference. Non-official public attribution may put the accusing government in a bind, forcing it to take more robust actions to push back against purported Chinese offensive cyber operations. If non-governmental attributions become a major tool to tarnish China's image, it will further undermine Beijing's willingness to conduct bilateral cybersecurity dialogue for consensus building because China's good-faith engagement will have little-to-no effect on the intensity of non-official public attribution campaigns.\n# The Case for Chinese-US Dialogue on Public Attribution Beijing and Washington rarely see eye to eye on public attribution, but it is an increasingly prominent issue in the bilateral relationship. As the initiator of many high-profile accusations, the United States seeks to derive strategic benefits from public attribution and chooses to turn a blind eye to many of its downsides. China has been on the receiving end of public attributions, many of which it thinks are unfair and unjustified. Beijing tends to set a high threshold for making public accusations and to put each case under a microscope.\nInformation asymmetry can make a case that appears convincing to the United States look deeply flawed from Beijing's perspective. And in the absence of substantive communication on technical specifics, divergences of opinion only increase. Perceptional gaps and structural problems have only amplified bilateral discord over the issue. Moreover, politicization, interest 22Michael S. Schmidt and David Sanger,\"5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks,\"The New York Times, May 19, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html.\nChina Quarterly of International Strategic Studies Vol. 8, No. 1 groups' influence, and the lack of evidentiary standards have made public attribution a major hurdle to Chinese-US cooperation in cyberspace. The following recommendations would help lessen the tensions and foster greater cyber strategic stability: (1) Reconsider the effectiveness of public attribution and its wider implications for bilateral relations: Past practices have proven that intergovernmental cooperation is the cornerstone of cyber strategic stability between Beijing and Washington, but irresponsible public attribution has undermined this stability and thrown bilateral cyber interaction into greater uncertainty. Chinese-US cyber relations should not be defined by disputes over public attribution. Instead, both sides should increase government-to-government dialogue to build a more comprehensive framework to address broader cybersecurity issues.\n(2) If public attributions must continue, conduct them prudently and in line with agreed-upon standards: Public attribution should not be used as a tool for geostrategic competition to add another layer of uncertainty to great power rivalry. The United States should consider allowing for a buffer period before attributions go public, during which Washington and Beijing can increase communication to build trust. It should also guide and limit counterproductive non-official public accusations and establish clear evidentiary standards to reduce politicization and internationalization of public attribution.\n(3) Establish a multilateral and multi-party regime for public attribution within the United Nations framework: The regime could be modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency to mobilize international resources and skills to strengthen the legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness of public attribution and deter truly harmful cyberattacks.\n(4) Increase dialogue and communication on public attribution: As mentioned earlier in this paper, public attribution is an emerging international security issue over which Beijing and Washington have contested for many years, with each insisting on their own positions and approaches. Continued engagement on the issue both at the policymaker and scholarly levels could help narrow some of the gaps and stabilize bilateral cyber relations.\nA Chinese Perspective on Public Cyber Attribution # Conclusion In cyber interactions between China and the United States, public attribution has gradually become a key issue affecting the relationship between the two countries. Due to the politicization and securitization of public attribution itself, there exist innate contradictions such as divergences in understanding, a disorder in operation, and differences for the accused in fathoming the motives of the accuser.\nWhen it refers to US–China cyber interactions, this misunderstanding is even more pronounced. The three motivations behind US attribution campaigns are incomprehensible and unreasonable in China's view, which not only undercuts China-US efforts to improve cybersecurity, but also deliberately smears China's cyber image by bringing a lot of trouble to China. Therefore, from Beijing's perspective, if China and the United States can restore or build intergovernmental communication mechanisms, conduct official and standardized attribution procedures, and make good use of the platform resources of international organizations such as the United Nations, it will help the two countries reach a better agreement, achieve multi-consensus, form a benign attribution mechanism, and build safe and efficient cyberspace."

Nowadays, various attributors (government agencies, tech companies, and consulting firms) are publishing attribution reports for many purposes, creating confusion in attribution operations. When it comes to attribution disputes between China and the United States, things are more complicated. Public attribution carried out by the United States against China not only deviates from reasonable range and track but also causes a great negative impact on the US–China cyber interactions. On the one hand, this problem is due to the perceptional differences between the two countries on public attribution. On the other hand, it is also due to the dislocation of attribution procedures. Also, deliberate intervention at the political level cannot be ignored.",
