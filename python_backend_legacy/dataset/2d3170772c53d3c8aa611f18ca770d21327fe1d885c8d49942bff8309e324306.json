Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n\n# RESUMEN\n\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario? Las características más relevantes de los conflictos cibernéticos, las cuales incluyen la intangibilidad de los daños cibernéticos y la ambigüedad de las obligaciones de la alianza, pueden alentar la elusión de estos compromisos.

Con el fin de comprobar si estas motivaciones se aplican también al ciberespacio, llevamos a cabo un experimento de encuesta con 1 424 ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en el que se estudia su respuesta a un ciberataque grave contra un Estado aliado. Investigamos no solo la disposición de nuestros participantes a tomar represalias en nombre de un aliado, sino también los motivos que dan forma a estas reacciones.

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” (Bytyci and Goga 2022). The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” (Higgins 2023).\n\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such",

Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018; Lee 2023), and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\n\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity (Burton 2015; Platte 2023) and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Gomez and Winger 2024). However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect (Tomz and Weeks 2021).\n\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase",

Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\n\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies (Burton 2015; Winger 2023). However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue (Dunn-Cavelty 2012). Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009 (Valeriano and Maness 2014) demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Gomez and Winger 2024). While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\n\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security (Smeets 2022; Platte 2023; Winger 2023). Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute (Leeds 2003; Leeds and Savun 2007; Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001), and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018). Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be",

Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\n\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression (Benson 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014; Smith 1998). Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014) or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\n\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence (Mehta 2021). The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response (Pearson and Landay 2022). Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks (Burton 2015; Jacobsen 2021), it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function (Platte 2023). Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit",

Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017) and active defense (Miki 2022; Mochinaga, 2024). However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies (Smeets 2021).\n\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked (Fearon 1997; Morrow 2000). However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small (Leeds 2003). Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\n\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace (Miller 2022). This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\n\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015). Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem (Egloff 2020; Rid and Buchanan 2015), lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023).

Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” (Starks and Cunningham 2022). Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\n\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure (Fazal 2021; Gartner 2008; Gartner and Segura 1998). In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Schneider 2017). Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population.

They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\n\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences (Kertzer 2022). This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action (Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022; Shandler and Gomez 2023).",

Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus (Knecht and Weatherford 2006; Knecht, 2015; Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Tomz and Weeks 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Bansak 2023). Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009), and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences (Leeds and Mattes 2022). Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\n\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains (Kreps and Schneider 2019) and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences (Saltzman 2013; Kostyuk and Wayne 2021). Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\n\nBut why?

While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors (Rathbun et al. 2016). Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n\n### Interests\n\nStates form alliances because their interests align (Henry 2020; Snyder 1984), and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009; Morrow 2000). Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals (Alley 2023). People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally (Tomz and Weeks 2021) and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n\n### Reputation\n\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.",

Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides (Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses (Donahue and Crescenzi 2023), maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors (Gibler 2008; Crescenzi et al. 2012; LeVeck and Narang 2017; Miller 2017).\n\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries (Lamb 2018; Winger, 2017). Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing (Fjelstul et al. 2015; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms (Egloff and Smeets 2023).“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n\n### Values\n\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations",

Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior (Akaha 2005; Harnisch 2017). While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment (Czosseck and Podins 2010). This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n\n## Research Design\n\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict (Gomez and Winger 2024). We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023), ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states (Egloff and Smeets 2023) and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.",

The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\n\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\n\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results (Brutger et al. 2023). Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2014). Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\n\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events (Leal and Musgrave 2023). While we are not alone in employing this treatment (Kreps and Das 2017), our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise (Hansen and",

Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\n\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another (Kreps and Schneider 2019). Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments (Huddleston 2019). After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\n\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study (Kreps et al. 2023; Lin-Greenberg 2022) nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\n\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.",

We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n\n## Analysis\n\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\n\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\n\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects.

Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\n\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Leal and Musgrave 2023) investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\n\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\n\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\n\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points.

These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization.

In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\n\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally.

This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708).

However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability.

Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict (Gibler 2008), indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.",

            "markdown": "That these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances (Alley 2023), concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\n\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection (Crescenzi et al. 2012; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.",

            "markdown": "Furthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors (Gartzke and Gleditsch 2004). However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\n\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability (Leeds and Mattes 2022) persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity (Brantly 2020; Nye 2017), this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding (Fjelstul and Reiter 2019). These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n\n## Disclosure statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking.

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” (Bytyci and Goga 2022). The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” (Higgins 2023).\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018; Lee 2023), and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity (Burton 2015; Platte 2023) and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Gomez and Winger 2024). However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect (Tomz and Weeks 2021).\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies (Burton 2015; Winger 2023). However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue (Dunn-Cavelty 2012). Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009 (Valeriano and Maness 2014) demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Gomez and Winger 2024). While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security (Smeets 2022; Platte 2023; Winger 2023). Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute (Leeds 2003; Leeds and Savun 2007; Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001), and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018). Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression (Benson 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014; Smith 1998). Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014) or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence (Mehta 2021). The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response (Pearson and Landay 2022). Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks (Burton 2015; Jacobsen 2021), it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function (Platte 2023). Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017) and active defense (Miki 2022; Mochinaga, 2024). However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies (Smeets 2021).\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked (Fearon 1997; Morrow 2000). However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small (Leeds 2003). Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace (Miller 2022). This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015). Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem (Egloff 2020; Rid and Buchanan 2015), lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force (Kreps and Das 2017; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021), the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear (Schneider 2017). Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” (Starks and Cunningham 2022). Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure (Fazal 2021; Gartner 2008; Gartner and Segura 1998). In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Schneider 2017). Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts (Benson 2011), alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences (Kertzer 2022). This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action (Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022; Shandler and Gomez 2023).\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus (Knecht and Weatherford 2006; Knecht, 2015; Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Tomz and Weeks 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Bansak 2023). Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009), and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences (Leeds and Mattes 2022). Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains (Kreps and Schneider 2019) and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences (Saltzman 2013; Kostyuk and Wayne 2021). Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors (Rathbun et al. 2016). Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align (Henry 2020; Snyder 1984), and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009; Morrow 2000). Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals (Alley 2023). People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally (Tomz and Weeks 2021) and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record (Crescenzi 2018; Jervis, Yarhi-Milo, and Casler 2021). Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides (Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses (Donahue and Crescenzi 2023), maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors (Gibler 2008; Crescenzi et al. 2012; LeVeck and Narang 2017; Miller 2017).\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries (Lamb 2018; Winger, 2017). Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing (Fjelstul et al. 2015; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms (Egloff and Smeets 2023).“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior (Akaha 2005; Harnisch 2017). While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment (Czosseck and Podins 2010). This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict (Gomez and Winger 2024). We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023), ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states (Egloff and Smeets 2023) and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results (Brutger et al. 2023). Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2014). Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events (Leal and Musgrave 2023). While we are not alone in employing this treatment (Kreps and Das 2017), our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise (Hansen and\nNissenbaum 2009) and first-hand experience (Gomez and Shandler 2024) sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another (Kreps and Schneider 2019). Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments (Huddleston 2019). After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study (Kreps et al. 2023; Lin-Greenberg 2022) nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion (Rathbun et al. 2016). We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Leal and Musgrave 2023) investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict (Gibler 2008), indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances (Alley 2023), concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection (Crescenzi et al. 2012; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors (Gartzke and Gleditsch 2004). However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability (Leeds and Mattes 2022) persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity (Brantly 2020; Nye 2017), this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding (Fjelstul and Reiter 2019). These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations.

We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n# RESUMEN\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario?

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” . The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” .\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested , and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity  and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace . However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect .\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies . However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue . Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009  demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack . While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security . Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute , and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II . Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression . Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions  or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence . The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies . Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response . Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks , it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function . Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement  and active defense . However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies .\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked . However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small . Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace . This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult . Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem , lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help . Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force , the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear . Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” . Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure . In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing . These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities . Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts , alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers . Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences . This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action . These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict .\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus . Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners . Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments , and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences . Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains  and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences . Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors . Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies  and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align , and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment . Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals . People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally  and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record . Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides . Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses , maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors .\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries . Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing . Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms .“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior . While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment . This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building , with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict . We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions , ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states  and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results . Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace . Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events . While we are not alone in employing this treatment , our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise  and first-hand experience  sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another . Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments . After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study  nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge . While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion . We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies  investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations , we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences , we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict , indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations , the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances , concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection . This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors . However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability  persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity , this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding . These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n# RESUMEN\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario?

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” . The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” .\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested , and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity  and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace . However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect .\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies . However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue . Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009  demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack . While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security . Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute , and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II . Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression . Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions  or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence . The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies . Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response . Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks , it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function . Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement  and active defense . However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies .\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked . However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small . Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace . This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult . Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem , lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help . Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force , the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear . Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” . Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure . In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing . These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities . Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts , alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers . Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences . This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action . These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict .\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus . Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners . Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments , and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences . Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains  and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences . Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors . Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies  and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align , and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment . Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals . People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally  and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record . Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides . Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses , maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors .\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries . Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing . Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms .“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior . While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment . This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building , with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict . We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions , ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states  and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results . Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace . Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events . While we are not alone in employing this treatment , our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise  and first-hand experience  sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another . Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments . After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study  nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge . While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion . We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies  investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations , we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences , we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict , indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations , the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances , concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection . This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors . However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability  persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity , this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding . These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n# RESUMEN\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario?

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” (Bytyci and Goga 2022). The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” (Higgins 2023).\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018; Lee 2023), and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity (Burton 2015; Platte 2023) and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Gomez and Winger 2024). However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect (Tomz and Weeks 2021).\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies (Burton 2015; Winger 2023). However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue (Dunn-Cavelty 2012). Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009 (Valeriano and Maness 2014) demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Gomez and Winger 2024). While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security (Smeets 2022; Platte 2023; Winger 2023). Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute (Leeds 2003; Leeds and Savun 2007; Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001), and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018). Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression (Benson 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014; Smith 1998). Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014) or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence (Mehta 2021). The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response (Pearson and Landay 2022). Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks (Burton 2015; Jacobsen 2021), it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function (Platte 2023). Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017) and active defense (Miki 2022; Mochinaga, 2024). However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies (Smeets 2021).\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked (Fearon 1997; Morrow 2000). However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small (Leeds 2003). Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace (Miller 2022). This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015). Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem (Egloff 2020; Rid and Buchanan 2015), lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force (Kreps and Das 2017; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021), the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear (Schneider 2017). Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” (Starks and Cunningham 2022). Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure (Fazal 2021; Gartner 2008; Gartner and Segura 1998). In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Schneider 2017). Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts (Benson 2011), alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences (Kertzer 2022). This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action (Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022; Shandler and Gomez 2023).\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus (Knecht and Weatherford 2006; Knecht, 2015; Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Tomz and Weeks 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Bansak 2023). Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009), and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences (Leeds and Mattes 2022). Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains (Kreps and Schneider 2019) and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences (Saltzman 2013; Kostyuk and Wayne 2021). Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors (Rathbun et al. 2016). Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align (Henry 2020; Snyder 1984), and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009; Morrow 2000). Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals (Alley 2023). People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally (Tomz and Weeks 2021) and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record (Crescenzi 2018; Jervis, Yarhi-Milo, and Casler 2021). Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides (Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses (Donahue and Crescenzi 2023), maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors (Gibler 2008; Crescenzi et al. 2012; LeVeck and Narang 2017; Miller 2017).\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries (Lamb 2018; Winger, 2017). Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing (Fjelstul et al. 2015; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms (Egloff and Smeets 2023).“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior (Akaha 2005; Harnisch 2017). While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment (Czosseck and Podins 2010). This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict (Gomez and Winger 2024). We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023), ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states (Egloff and Smeets 2023) and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results (Brutger et al. 2023). Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2014). Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events (Leal and Musgrave 2023). While we are not alone in employing this treatment (Kreps and Das 2017), our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise (Hansen and\nNissenbaum 2009) and first-hand experience (Gomez and Shandler 2024) sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another (Kreps and Schneider 2019). Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments (Huddleston 2019). After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study (Kreps et al. 2023; Lin-Greenberg 2022) nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion (Rathbun et al. 2016). We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Leal and Musgrave 2023) investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict (Gibler 2008), indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances (Alley 2023), concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection (Crescenzi et al. 2012; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors (Gartzke and Gleditsch 2004). However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability (Leeds and Mattes 2022) persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity (Brantly 2020; Nye 2017), this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding (Fjelstul and Reiter 2019). These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n# RESUMEN\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario?

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” (Bytyci and Goga 2022). The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” (Higgins 2023).\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018; Lee 2023), and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity (Burton 2015; Platte 2023) and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Gomez and Winger 2024). However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect (Tomz and Weeks 2021).\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies (Burton 2015; Winger 2023). However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue (Dunn-Cavelty 2012). Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009 (Valeriano and Maness 2014) demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Gomez and Winger 2024). While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security (Smeets 2022; Platte 2023; Winger 2023). Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute (Leeds 2003; Leeds and Savun 2007; Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001), and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II (Berkemeier and Fuhrmann 2018). Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression (Benson 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014; Smith 1998). Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions (Fuhrmann and Sechser 2014) or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence (Mehta 2021). The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response (Pearson and Landay 2022). Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks (Burton 2015; Jacobsen 2021), it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function (Platte 2023). Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017) and active defense (Miki 2022; Mochinaga, 2024). However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies (Smeets 2021).\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked (Fearon 1997; Morrow 2000). However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small (Leeds 2003). Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace (Miller 2022). This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015). Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem (Egloff 2020; Rid and Buchanan 2015), lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023; Hedgecock and Sukin 2023). Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force (Kreps and Das 2017; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021), the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear (Schneider 2017). Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” (Starks and Cunningham 2022). Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure (Fazal 2021; Gartner 2008; Gartner and Segura 1998). In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Schneider 2017). Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts (Benson 2011), alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences (Kertzer 2022). This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action (Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022; Shandler and Gomez 2023).\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus (Knecht and Weatherford 2006; Knecht, 2015; Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017). Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Tomz and Weeks 2021; Tomz, Weeks, and Bansak 2023). Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009), and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences (Leeds and Mattes 2022). Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains (Kreps and Schneider 2019) and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences (Saltzman 2013; Kostyuk and Wayne 2021). Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors (Rathbun et al. 2016). Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies (Gomez and Whyte 2022; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align (Henry 2020; Snyder 1984), and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment (Leeds 2003; Leeds, Mattes, and Vogel 2009; Morrow 2000). Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals (Alley 2023). People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally (Tomz and Weeks 2021) and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record (Crescenzi 2018; Jervis, Yarhi-Milo, and Casler 2021). Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides (Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses (Donahue and Crescenzi 2023), maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors (Gibler 2008; Crescenzi et al. 2012; LeVeck and Narang 2017; Miller 2017).\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries (Lamb 2018; Winger, 2017). Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing (Fjelstul et al. 2015; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms (Egloff and Smeets 2023).“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior (Akaha 2005; Harnisch 2017). While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment (Czosseck and Podins 2010). This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict (Gomez and Winger 2024). We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions (Hedgecock and Sukin 2023; Leal and Musgrave 2023), ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states (Egloff and Smeets 2023) and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results (Brutger et al. 2023). Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace (Valeriano and Maness 2014). Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events (Leal and Musgrave 2023). While we are not alone in employing this treatment (Kreps and Das 2017), our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise (Hansen and\nNissenbaum 2009) and first-hand experience (Gomez and Shandler 2024) sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another (Kreps and Schneider 2019). Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments (Huddleston 2019). After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study (Kreps et al. 2023; Lin-Greenberg 2022) nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion (Rathbun et al. 2016). We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies (Guenther and Musgrave 2022; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Leal and Musgrave 2023) investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020), we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict (Gibler 2008), indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019), the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances (Alley 2023), concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection (Crescenzi et al. 2012; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015). This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors (Gartzke and Gleditsch 2004). However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability (Leeds and Mattes 2022) persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity (Brantly 2020; Nye 2017), this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding (Fjelstul and Reiter 2019). These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability (Leeds and Mattes 2022) persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity (Brantly 2020; Nye 2017), this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding (Fjelstul and Reiter 2019). These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country."

Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.\n# RESUMEN\nLas alianzas internacionales han incorporado la ciberseguridad dentro de sus mandatos de seguridad colectiva, pero ¿se cumplirán estos compromisos si fuera necesario? Las características más relevantes de los conflictos cibernéticos, las cuales incluyen la intangibilidad de los daños cibernéticos y la ambigüedad de las obligaciones de la alianza, pueden alentar la elusión de estos compromisos. Sin embargo, los estudios relativos a la capacidad de respuesta de las alianzas sugieren que, si bien la traición puede resultar rentable, las preocupaciones subyacentes con respecto a los intereses, la moralidad, la reputación nacional y la identidad compartida pueden obligar a un aliado a cumplir con sus obligaciones. Con el fin de comprobar si estas motivaciones se aplican también al ciberespacio, llevamos a cabo un experimento de encuesta con 1 424 ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en el que se estudia su respuesta a un ciberataque grave contra un Estado aliado. Investigamos no solo la disposición de nuestros participantes a tomar represalias en nombre de un aliado, sino también los motivos que dan forma a estas reacciones. Concluimos que cuando se les recuerda los compromisos de la alianza, los participantes están a favor de ayudar a los aliados.

Les caractéristiques clés du cyberconflit, dont le caractère non physique des cyberpréjudices et l'ambiguïté des obligations de l'alliance, peuvent inciter les États à se dérober. Néanmoins, les études relatives à la réactivité des alliances suggèrent que bien que la perfidie puisse se montrer profitable, les préoccupations sous-jacentes quant aux intérêts, à la moralité, à la réputation nationale et à l'identité partagée peuvent pousser un allié à remplir ses obligations. Pour évaluer si ces motivations s'appliquent aussi au cyberespace, nous menons une expérience de sondage auprès de 1 424 ressortissants américains pour analyser leur réaction en cas de grave cyberattaque à l'encontre d'un État allié. Nous sondons la volonté de nos participants de contre-attaquer au nom d'un allié, mais aussi les raisons qui motivent ces réactions. D'après nos résultats, quand on leur rappelle les engagements pris dans le cadre de l'alliance, les participants préfèrent aider les alliés et cette réaction s'explique par des préoccupations relatives aux intérêts, à la moralité et à la réputation, mais pas à l'identité.\n## Introduction\nIn 2022, Albania suffered a series of debilitating cyberattacks that “threatened to paralyze public services...and fuel insecurity and chaos in the country” . The attacks combined a severe data breach with destructive malware that disrupted critical government services. Investigators subsequently attributed the incident to Iran, who conducted the attack in response to Albania's harboring of Iranian dissidents. In response, Albania cut diplomatic relations with Iran and considered invoking the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) mutual defense requirements under Article V. “It is an attack—an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state,” stated Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, adding that cyber was “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means” .\nThe 2022 incident between Albania and Iran marked the first significant test of NATO's commitment to collective cyber defense since the alliance extended Article V protections to include cyberattacks in 2021. Although Albania ultimately opted not to invoke Article V, the episode highlights the growth of cyberspace as a theater of international conflict and the viability of collective cybersecurity. However, while Prime Minister Rama asserts an equivalency between cyber and conventional aggression, such\nclaims are only substantive if they are accepted by Albania's allies and acted upon. Since World War II, several alliances have floundered once tested , and extending existing pacts to include cybersecurity may prove tenuous. Cyberspace reduces the audience cost of inaction, and while allied sentiment may be robust in response to a conventional threat, would such solidarity exist when the harm inflicted is virtual, not visceral?\nInvestigations of alliances in cyber conflict focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective cybersecurity  and the conditionality of alliance commitments in cyberspace . However, why countries would honor commitments and aid partners victimized by cyber aggression remains unclear. Lacking the visual and explicit cues accompanying kinetic attacks, the motives for upholding collective commitments in cyber conflict are essential for understanding the commitments' viability and assessing their potential reliability. This is particularly acute for democracies, given the prominent role of public sentiment in shaping elite preferences and where public support for aiding allies may be suspect .\nTo better understand popular sentiments towards alliance commitments in cyberspace and why individuals may or may not aid partners victimized by cyber aggression, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1,424 United States nationals exploring how the public responds to a cyberattack targeting an allied state. Participants are presented with a fictitious scenario wherein a United States ally experiences a significant cyber incident attributed to an adversarial state actor. We vary the scenario by (1) the underlying obligations expected of the United States, (2) the consequences of the incident, and (3) the ally-adversary dyad. Following the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating on behalf of the ally and whether their preferences are grounded on (1) the security interests of the United States, (2) its reputation, (3) the morality of defending an ally, or (4) the ally's identity. This provides insights into the underlying motivations and explains their decision to (not) honor alliance commitments in cyberspace. Consequently, we find participant preference is robust and mediated by the belief that adhering to alliance obligations enhances the security and reputation of the United States. Furthermore, participants believe this to be morally appropriate. However, there is no evidence that the identity of an ally (i.e. as part of the in-group) influences their preferences. These findings illustrate that while cyber and conventional conflict may be seen as distinct phenomena, the motivations underlying public support remain consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the explicit inclusion of cybersecurity as an alliance commitment may increase\nreliability in the digital domain. Publicly including cybersecurity within an alliance framework increases the security, reputation, and moral damage from shirking. Concern over these costs spurs the willingness to aid allies and suggests that the expansion of an alliance's commitments and its dependability may be self-reinforcing, with the credibility of upholding the commitments itself motivating allied responsiveness.\n## Don't Leave me Hanging on the Telephone\nThe integration of cybersecurity within alliances was a gradual process, with pre-existing points of cooperation such as communications, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement extended into cyberspace following the adoption of information communications technologies . However, incidents from 2007 to 2010 involving the offensive use of cyber capabilities hinted at its strategic potential, resulting in the inclusion of cybersecurity as a national security issue . Incidents like the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 and South Korea in 2009  demonstrated how cyberspace enables adversaries to circumvent alliance commitments and inflict harm while remaining below the threshold of armed attack . While not all collective security organizations have extended their mandates into cyberspace, most prominent pacts, including NATO and the United States-Japan alliance, have stated that a cyberattack can trigger mutual defense responsibilities.\nCurrent examinations of alliance activities in cyberspace focus on the challenges of operationalizing collective security . Nevertheless, as alliances extend their security umbrellas into cyberspace, questions abound about why allies would honor such commitments if invoked. While most alliances have proven dependable (Leeds, Long, and Mitchell 2000), this reliability is not absolute , and the honoring of defense pacts have had a mixed record since World War II . Defections from multiple coalitions proved common during the Arab-Israeli Wars of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Likewise, multiple post-Soviet collective security agreements were violated during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict (ibid.), with Russia conspicuously abandoning Armenia during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. Such behavior does not necessarily portend the future of NATO or other alliances. However, it underscores that the resolute support of partners cannot be\nassumed. Moreover, while alliances can assert that collective defense exists in cyberspace, would such declarations hold in a crisis? Critically, many of the unique attributes of cyber conflict undercut core tenets of alliance reliability, potentially increasing the likelihood of defection.\nDeterrence is a critical component of alliance success, with the most successful pacts often being those alliances that dissuade adversarial aggression . Lee (2023) assessed that not only has the rate at which states defend allies fallen since 1945 but that this decline corresponds with the strength of the alliances' deterrent value. Lee (2023) identified a bifurcation in alliances since World War II. Alliances have either been able to deter adversaries successfully and remain effective as unchallenged institutions  or failing to dissuade opponents; adversaries openly challenge alliances, and their commitments are abandoned once obligations become tangible.\nLee's conclusion that alliances either successfully deter or fall victim to external challenges and internal defection augurs poorly for their prospects in cyber conflict. Emerging technologies introduce new points of uncertainty into strategic conditions that undermine extended deterrence . The limits of extended deterrence are significant in cyberspace, where domain characteristics may be antithetical to deterrence strategies . Unlike conventional domains of conflict, cyber operations' speed, interconnectivity, and opacity allow actors to reshape security conditions and advance their interests while remaining below the threshold of armed attack (Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett 2022). Rather than episodic attacks, actors conduct persistent cyber campaigns that substantially alter security conditions and can have strategic effects. This distinction is reflected in how alliances discuss cybersecurity. For example, unlike conventional domains of conflict, NATO has expressly identified cyber campaigns below the threshold of armed attack as a strategic challenge that can trigger an alliance response . Not only may alliances with effective conventional deterrents fail to translate these prerogatives into the digital domain, but pacts that have succeeded thus far by being unchallenged may increasingly be tried by the unique dynamics of cyber conflict and exposed as wanting. Even as alliances create new practices and institutions to bolster the credibility of their response to cyberattacks , it is unclear how such collective mechanisms will function . Notably, the latent vulnerability of cyberspace necessitates that capable actors exploit\nthe environment lest they cede the initiative to adversaries, in what Fischerkeller, Goldman, and Harknett (2022) term a cyber fait accompli. Consequently, individual alliance members increasingly adopt more proactive strategies for cyber defense through persistent engagement  and active defense . However, it is unclear how such forward-leaning measures will function within a collective security arrangement or if alliances can implement such strategies .\nThe ambiguities of cyber conflict further exacerbate the potential for defections by reducing the costs of inaction. Alliance commitments are a form of costly signaling where public commitments to a future course of action increase the political and reputational costs incurred by shirking from those responsibilities when invoked . However, alliances are not suicide pacts. Governments abandon alliance commitments when the costs of fulfilling an obligation are judged too great, and the price for defecting is relatively small . Parties often add conditions and qualifications into agreements that purposefully curtail the applicability of an alliance to avoid entrapment and reduce the penalties associated with failing to honor commitments (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015; Kim 2011).\nCyberspace may exacerbate the problem of opportunistic defections since the vague promises of collective cybersecurity have negligible value as hand-tying mechanisms, and the novel characteristic of cyberspace reduces the penalties of defecting. For instance, Russian tanks surging through the Suwałki corridor would be treated as an unequivocal attack on NATO. However, there is no clear envisioning of what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace . This strategic ambiguity may have advantages given the dynamism of cyberspace (Prucková 2022), but it also creates ideal conditions for opportunistic defections. Rather than tying hands, the nebulous nature of alliance commitments means that hesitant allies can selectively interpret their obligations and reduce non-compliance costs by claiming that cyber incidents fall outside their understanding of treaty requirements.\nPrevalent attributional difficulties further enable allied dithering. For the invocation of an alliance to be meaningful, it must be invoked against someone. However, attributing malicious acts is difficult . Even as strides are being made in resolving the attribution problem , lingering uncertainty over attribution and weaponized ambiguity provides ample fodder for reluctant allies to demur when asked for help . Furthermore, while exercising cyber capabilities to inflict casualties can engender responses akin to the\nconventional use of force , the direct use of a cyber operation to inflict casualties has not yet occurred, and the appetite to respond forcefully remains unclear . Prime Minister Rama wrestled with this issue in 2022, “The bombs are not visible, the wounds are not physical...but still [it] is an aggression, a bombardment, and it's direct harm to the national sovereignty” . Attributional uncertainty and the absence of visceral reactions aroused by human casualties influence the political calculation of alliance defections. Instead of abandoning an ally, the muddied nature of collective cybersecurity means that governments can justify inaction in ways that mitigate audience costs and diffuse the risk of backlash.\nLastly, while cyberspace tempers the costs of defection, its interconnectedness increases the risk of retaliation and direct costs from aiding an ally. Conventional weapons have a limited range that reduces the potential for a partner to be attacked when supporting an ally. However, these boundaries are absent in cyberspace, with geographically distant allies subject to retaliatory cyberattacks. This dynamic is apparent in the 2022 Russo-Ukraine War. While combat is primarily confined to the geographic boundaries of Ukraine, cyber operations continue unfolding globally, with many of Ukraine's foreign backers targeted by cyber operations. Although the damage inflicted by these attacks remains marginal, they underscore the global nature of cyber conflict. This matters for alliance reliability as the willingness of an ally to suffer direct losses for the sake of a partner is an obstacle to alliance cohesion and is often a critical point of failure . In 1961, Charles de Gaulle pointedly asked John Kennedy whether the American president would risk New York for Paris, and such considerations carry into cyber conflict. Indeed, while there is evidence that general populations support allied commitments in cyberspace, fear of retaliation tempers and dissuades allied backing . These findings are echoed in wargaming studies on cyber conflict, where fear of retaliation and escalation led to inaction instead of the aggressive application of cyber capabilities . Consequently, while declining to aid an ally embroiled in cyber conflict may have minimal costs, fulfilling that obligation risks reprisals with direct costs incurred by your population. These factors\nsuggest that while alliances are eager to extend their mandates into cyberspace, the veracity of those commitments might be suspect.\n## Why Comply?\nAs incomplete contracts , alliances share many qualities with Schrödinger's cat. They simultaneously exist as purely hypothetical obligations and concrete commitments for future action whose veracity can only be proven once openly challenged and subsequently invoked. Although the reliability of an alliance remains unknown until it is tested, experimental methods present an opportunity to investigate collective security dynamics and gain insight into their potential behavior (Hafner-Burton, LeVeck, and Victor 2017; Narang and LeVeck 2019; Reiter and Greenhill 2024). While situational contexts color the decision to comply with mutual defense obligations, understanding the motives for why leaders would answer at all helps identify the mechanisms underpinning collective security arrangements. Specifically, integrating cyberspace within alliance mandates is a significant expansion of alliance commitments and responsibilities. Successfully navigating the digital domain is critical for alliances to continue serving as security providers in the 21st century; failing to uphold these new expectations could damage the overall credibility of a pact. Realizing collective cybersecurity requires significant support from alliance members, and identifying whether the motivations that compel allied responsiveness in conventional conflicts carry into the digital domain is a crucial step for actualizing alliance commitments in cybersecurity.\nPublic opinion research provides an opportunity to probe this prospect and illuminates the reasons that could inform either aiding or abandoning an ally following a cyberattack. While the choice to fulfill alliance commitments ultimately rests with political elites, the public helps us understand how this calculus unfolds, identifying the motives influencing decision-makers . Publics are not policymakers, and while public opinion research is an imperfect proxy for elites, it serves as a valuable barometer for future policy choices. Research shows a commonality between elite and non-elite thinking and policy preferences . This convergence is especially relevant when considering military action . These similarities between leaders and the public are informative when exploring underlying motivations and perceptions rather than specific policy prescriptions. Furthermore, while public opinion may not be identical to leader preferences, it provides a baseline for understanding how individuals navigate novel challenges like cyber conflict .\nPolitical elites do not make decisions in a vacuum. Populations mold the political atmosphere in which foreign policy decisions are made and influence the decision-makers' calculus . Especially when concerning the use of force, public opinion can play a decisive role in guiding decision-makers and constraining leaders' policy choices (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020). Popular sentiment appears particularly poignant when considering alliances, with populations expressing a strong desire to support security partners . Indeed, democracies, where public opinion is most salient, are more likely to honor their alliance commitments , and democratic institutions can help sustain alliance participation despite significant changes in leader preferences . Conversely, the uptick in abandoning allies since World War II appears to be concentrated among non-democratic regimes insulated from public opinion. While public opinion cannot guarantee the responsiveness of allies, it constitutes a significant factor in guiding democratic leaders and can help promote the fulfillment of obligations.\nWhile scholars have conducted several studies examining the nexus between public opinion and alliance behavior, its applicability to cyberspace remains an open question. This is important given the difference in how the public perceives cyberspace vis-à-vis conventional domains  and how factors like personal experience and perceived vulnerability may uniquely guide policy preferences . Guenther and Musgrave (2022) find that while conditions like the severity of the attack matter, the American public views alliance commitments in cybersecurity as meaningful and endorses responding to a cyberattack on a NATO ally through cyber means. Notably, the prospect of a lethal cyberattack triggered a meaningful response and suggests that the threshold for alliance responsiveness in cyber warfare may parallel the loss-of-life threshold seen with conventional attacks. Relatedly, Gomez and Winger (2024) find that this willingness to support allies extends into Asia. Moreover, this threshold for responsiveness may be knowledge, not casualties, with individuals most familiar with cybersecurity perceiving cyberspace as a collective security responsibility regardless of attack severity. This finding is significant as it shows that as cyber operations lose their novelty, individuals recognize the strategic challenge of cyber operations and endorse collective defense without relying on conventional heuristics like casualties.\nBut why? Given the seemingly small costs of shirking, why would states and their populations willingly risk the added costs of aiding allies in cyber\nconflicts? While we cannot test alliance reliability in the abstract, several distinct motivations exist for why the public supports fulfilling obligations to allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021), which can be extended into cyberspace and may inform the willingness to aid an ally targeted by cyberaggression. Turning to individual-level factors shaping foreign policy has proven valuable for probing such underlying thinking and explaining decision-makers' behaviors . Such efforts already exist within cyber conflict studies  and have helped identify some of the peculiar characteristics of the digital domain. By investigating the motivational lenses through which populations interpret their alliance commitments, we gain insight into how existing motivations for honoring alliance commitments translate into cyberspace and whether the unique characteristics of cyber conflict temper these reasons.\n### Interests\nStates form alliances because their interests align , and shared interests remain a critical predictor of alliance fulfillment . Consequently, the desire to aid an ally may be instrumental rather than altruistic. This logic of common interests explains how disparate states like Russia and France formed a highly credible pact before WWI and is evident in both mass appeal and elite calculus. Notably, the presence of an “ally” provides a cognitive heuristic for uniformed individuals . People are significantly more willing to endorse military action to support an ally than a non-ally  and are particularly sympathetic to alliance rhetoric stressing common interests (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). A similar logic may move individuals to aid allies victimized by cyberattacks, especially considering cyberspace's interconnectedness and latent vulnerability, where damage can cascade beyond the intended target (Forsyth, Wood, and Pope 2014; Saltzman 2013). In effect, distance does not provide an assurance of safety such that aiding an ally is in the interest of the security provider. “H1: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because it is believed to be in their own interest.”\n### Reputation\nShallow alliances are still commitments, and failing to fulfill even their ambiguous extension into cyberspace may carry reputational costs.\nReputation is the idea that a government's conduct and tendencies are observed by other actors who will predict future actions based on this record . Questions of reputation have been closely linked to perceptions of credibility, with adherence to commitments seen as a signal of a country's bonafides . Although research shows that a reputation as a reliable ally weathers episodic lapses , maintaining this can attract new partners while violating an alliance carries significant audience costs that can impede future endeavors .\nWhile outside observers can draw inferences based on actions, concern over one's reputation and perception can be a powerful motivator for leaders. (Dafoe, Renshon, and Huth 2014; Dafoe and Caughey 2016). After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Henry Kissinger advocated for aggressive responses to incidents with Cambodia and North Korea, fearing that failing to respond forcefully would further undercut America's credibility with allies and invite future challenges from adversaries . Populations are not immune to such sentiments and worry that reneging on an alliance may harm their state's standing . Consequently, while alliance commitments in cyberspace may be tenuous, the desire to preserve one's reputation remains unchanged and may be sufficient to motivate people to aid allies. Moreover, the influence of reputation is especially pronounced in instances of cyber conflict as states increasingly turn to strategies such as public attribution to signal support for embattled partners and adherence to salient cyber norms .“H2: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is important for upholding their country's reputation.”\n### Values\nScholars have found that moral beliefs inform foreign policy preferences (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser 1999; Kertzer et al. 2014), and values may play a role in alliance fulfillment. This is particularly striking when weighing potentially costly courses of action like military interventions. Believing that a policy is right carries considerable weight in shaping policy preferences (Bennis, Medin, and Bartels 2010; Kreps and Maxey 2018; Tomz and Weeks 2013). Regarding collective security, direct appeals to values help motivate support for allies (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) and may inform the extension of this support into cyberspace. Recent scholarship on cyber harms' legal and psychological dimensions (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022) justifies aiding an embattled partner. Consequently, rather than self-interested calculations involving interests or reputation, populations\nmay support aiding allies after cyberattacks because they believe it is right and value acting morally in world affairs.\n> H3: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they believe it is the right thing to do.\n### Identity\nRelationships are not just about politics. Through history and culture, international affinities develop between states beyond formal arrangements and may matter in determining behavior . While all allies may enjoy collective security guarantees, relationships between countries are not identical, and allied responsiveness may be informed by partiality as much as interests. Populations may be more willing to aid allies they identify with and believe are in the same in-group (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021). This is distinct from generalized alliance commitments because the desire to aid is based on identifying positively with the victim and wanting to aid them as a result. A similar identity-driven mechanism is argued to exist in cyberspace, given shared conceptions of the environment . This, in turn, enables (or hinders) cooperative ventures such as norms-building , with like-minded states more easily reaching consensus on what should be done.\n> H4: Publics will support fulfilling allied commitments in cybersecurity because they identify with the victimized ally.\n## Research Design\nTo understand the motives for fulfilling alliance commitments in cyberspace, we design a survey experiment to examine alliance dynamics following cyber conflict . We employ a scenario wherein an ally of the United States is targeted by a destructive cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. Although uncertainty concerning the perpetrator of a cyberattack can color reactions , ambiguities over attribution are not tested. This decision reflects the willingness of governments to publicly attribute significant cyberattacks to other states  and the belief that attribution is necessary for the invocation of an alliance to be believable. Furthermore, our scenario demonstrates the need to balance external and internal validity expectations, reflected in (1) the use of real-world states, (2) specific aggressor-ally dyads, and (3) the physical effects of the incident depicted.\nThe fictitious scenario involves an ally of the United States that experiences a cyber operation initiated by a named adversary. The scenario details are randomized along three dimensions: commitment, dyad, and casualties. Commitment represents allied obligations between the target and the United States. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that both are expected to come to each other's defense following an attack (i.e. mutual defense). Dyad varies the aggressor-ally pair and depicts a scenario involving Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. Finally, casualties vary the incident severity. Participants who receive this treatment are informed that over a hundred nationals from the allied states died following the incident.\nCritical infrastructure in [Japan/the United Kingdom] was damaged following a cyberattack attributed to [China/Russia]. [Over one hundred Japanese citizens died because of this attack./Over one hundred citizens of the United Kingdom died because of this attack.] [The United States is an ally of Japan and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country./The United States is an ally of the United Kingdom and a common defense treaty obliges both countries to assist one another if one is attacked by a foreign country].\nWhile the debate surrounding abstraction in experiments continues, we do not feel that using real country names biases our results . Instead, the scenario recreates real-world interactions that are schema- and treatment-consistent. These conditions are emphasized by the fact that the Russia-United Kingdom and China-Japan dyads have and continue to engage with one another in cyberspace . Furthermore, while the public may not be familiar with the minutia of these interactions, media reporting, and elite statements provide a reference point. Consequently, we avoid creating an artificial scenario wherein the United States does not have defense obligations with the aggrieved party. Instead, we assume some level of knowledge among participants of these obligations such that the treatment replicates the attempt by elites to remind the public of this obligation. The scenario recreates the conditions that motivate calls to expand existing alliance commitments into cyberspace and two alliances that have explicitly extended their defensive mandates into this domain.\nNevertheless, some may argue that casualties do not accurately capture the reality of cyber conflict, given the rarity of mass casualty events . While we are not alone in employing this treatment , our depiction is based on the characteristics of cyberspace and the unpredictable consequences of cybersecurity incidents. In cases where loss of life follows incidents, these are often second or third-order effects. However, limited domain expertise  and first-hand experience  sustain hyperbolic narratives among elites and the public. Consequently, varying casualties correspond with how these incidents are portrayed and their future potential.\nFollowing the scenario, participants indicate their support for retaliating against the aggressor through (1) cyber or (2) conventional means. These are measured using a six-point Likert scale that ranges from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree” and presented as two separate questions that correspond with the finding that the American public views these as normatively distinct from one another . Furthermore, participants are reminded of the possibility that the aggressor may respond and move to act against the United States. This anticipates the tendency of participants to discount the consequences of their choices in these experiments . After indicating their level of support for either conventional or cyber retaliation, we inquire whether their decision is (1) grounded in morality (moral), (2) in support of the security of the United States (interest), (3) crucial in upholding the image of the United States (reputation) or reflects the need to defend a like-minded state (identity) using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” (H1 to H4).\nWhile it seems counterintuitive to adopt an outcome-mediator (O.M.) design (i.e. the relevant mediators are captured after the outcome variable(s)), this is neither unique to the study  nor does there exist consensus as to which order is most appropriate (i.e. O.M. versus M.O.). Possible order effects necessitate special attention to the sequence in which the outcome and mediator variables are captured (Chaudoin, Gaines, and Livny 2021). Considering the former, and concerning this experiment (i.e. cyber and conventional), prompting participants of instrumentality-, morality-, and identity-based justifications beforehand may bias participants to defend the aggrieved party. Relatedly, the phrasing of questions that capture both cyber and conventional is distinct and focuses on the means rather than the mechanism that drives the participants' responses. This minimizes the risk of bias resulting from the outcome variables preceding the mediators.\nApart from the outcome and mediating variables, the public opinion and cyber conflict literature identify several covariates that affect how publics respond to cybersecurity incidents. These include foreign policy attitudes, ideology, news consumption, familiarity with the United States' political system, and cybersecurity knowledge . While not exhaustive, these are shown to exert influence over policy preferences under experimental conditions.\nEstablished foreign policy attitudes consistently predict public opinion . We employ a battery of questions to measure cooperative, militant, and isolationist tendencies using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree”. Relatedly, ideology is also observed to move policy preferences predictably. As a counterpoint to latent beliefs, knowledge moderates participant preferences. We include three additional measures: news, politics, and cyber. News captures the number of days in the week that the participants read, listen, or watch the news and is a rough measure of how well participants follow developments in the international sphere. This is represented as a count variable (0--7). Politics, on the other hand, measures participant familiarity with the United States' political system and functions as a proxy for their awareness of the nuances of foreign policy construction. This is captured using a questionnaire, resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1. Finally, cyber measures cybersecurity knowledge and serves as a proxy for domain expertise. This is captured using a questionnaire developed by Gomez and Whyte (2021), resulting in a numerical score between 0 and 1.\n## Analysis\nUsing Lucid Theorem, we recruited a representative sample of 1,424 participants between Dec 2022 and January 2023, meeting the requirements of the apriori power analysis for an alpha of 0.8. The 2x2x2 design resulted in eight treatment groups, with approximately 178 participants assigned to each. Balance checks reveal successful randomization across treatment conditions.\nThe mean age is 45.36 years (SD = 16.64), with males accounting for 44.73% (637) of the participants, with 66.08% (941) possessing a Bachelor's degree or higher. Participants consume news approximately 4.31 days (SD = 2.53) per week, suggesting some familiarity with current events. However, a mean of 0.4 (SD = 0.29) for politics indicates limited knowledge of the United States' political system, with a comparable pattern observed for their cyber knowledge (0.29, SD = 0.24). In terms of foreign policy attitudes, participants noticeably favor cooperative (4.12, SD = 1.01) policies as opposed to militant (3.9, SD = 0.78) or isolationist (3.7, SD = 0.88) ones.\nAs for the outcome variables, we first describe support for cyber and conventional options presented without considering treatment effects. For ease of interpretation, we transform the six-point Likert scale into a\ncontinuous measure from 1--100 to better represent the format of public opinion polls. Participants do not appear to favor one policy option over another, with cyber reflecting a mean of 47.84 (SD = 28.67) compared to 45.69 (SD = 28.18) for conventional.\nGiven the comparable but statistically dissimilar retaliatory preferences (p < 0.05), we construct the compound variable defend using the mean of cyber and conventional, which represents the propensity of participants to respond rather than a strict means-based preference, which other studies  investigate in greater detail. Consequently, all subsequent analyses are conducted using defend as the outcome variable. However, given the distinction between cyber and conventional operations , we replicate our analysis on the disaggregated components.\nAs for the mediators, safeguarding the security interests of the United States is the prevailing rationale amongst participants (4.18, SD = 1.3). This is followed by a sense of shared identity (4.16, SD = 1.24) and the need to maintain the United States' reputation (4.13, SD = 1.31). However, the morality of adhering to commitments appears the least salient (3.99, SD = 1.36). Correlational analysis reveals a strong positive and significant relationship.\nTo evaluate the effects of the treatment on defend, we constructed three models (see Figure 1). Independent of the covariates and mediators, only commitment is statistically significant, such that emphasizing alliance commitments increases the participants' willingness to challenge the aggressor by 3.142 points. However, commitment decreases and loses statistical significance once the mediators are included, suggesting that commitment may be fully mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity.\nConcerning the mediators, perceptions of shared interest raise participants' willingness to defend an ally by 2.383 points. Relatedly, reputational concerns led to a 3.803-point gain. Interestingly, perceptions of the morality of adhering to obligations have the most impact, increasing support by 4.216 points. Finally, while the direction of identity corresponds with our theoretical expectations, it remains statistically insignificant. With these in mind, the data supports the importance of instrumental (H1),\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 1. Defend OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of percentage points.\nreputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning within the sample. Inversely, there appears to be limited support for shared identity (H4) as driving participant preferences.\nWe assert, however, that perceptions of shared interests, reputational backlash, moral obligations, and in-group identity that encourage support for retaliatory policies emerge from their knowledge of pre-existing alliance commitments. These develop once participants are reminded of their commitment. We regress interest, reputation, morality, and identity on commitment to test this. Furthermore, we note that the salience of existing obligations may be moderated by specific aggressor-ally (dyad) pairings and the event's severity (casualties). For instance, participants may develop a pronounced sense of moral outrage when actions against an ally result in death, or perceptions of shared interests may emerge based on specific aggressor-ally pairings.\nAs shown in Figure 2, commitment increases morality (0.445), interest (0.215), and reputation (0.362) consistently and significantly. Furthermore, a preference for cooperative foreign policies buoys these mediators, suggesting that participants may draw parallels between conventional and cyber issues. Nevertheless, neither casualties nor dyad moderate the effects of commitment, indicating that participants might recognize the latent value of obligations to allies without further contextualization. Overall, these results support our proposed hypotheses that instrumental (H1), reputational (H2), and value-based (H3) reasoning drives participant preference.\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 2. Treatment and mediator OLS regression.\nResults are reported in terms of the 7-point Likert scale used in the instrument.\nStarting with interest, participants perceive overlapping strategic benefits when reminded of treaty obligations such that a unit increase in interest encourages support for defending an allied state. In essence, participants perceive shared interests vis-à-vis addressing the threat posed by malicious cyber behavior (H1). Relatedly, treaty obligations prompt concerns regarding one's reputation, demonstrating that reputational concerns motivate participants to defend an ally. Despite the ease with which cyberspace allows for reneging on commitments, participants still acknowledge the possibility of reputational damage (H2).\nAside from instrumentalist logic, participants associate adherence to commitments with a moral obligation to defend an ally. Despite the immateriality of cyberspace, participants still recognize the moral obligation to assist allies grounded on the harms that follow from cybersecurity incidents (H3). Nevertheless, the analysis does not support the argument that treaty commitments generate a sense of shared identity that discourages ally abandonment. While discourse surrounding cyber conflict suggests the presence of identity-based logic (H4), this does not appear to be salient among non-elites in our experiment.\nAs a further test of our hypotheses, we perform mediation analysis to determine whether the effects of commitment are mediated through interest, reputation, morality, and identity (see Figure 3). The results further strengthen our proposed causal mechanism. Reminded of existing treaty obligations, participants base their decision to support an ally on instrumental-, values-, and identity-based logics. Furthermore, we establish that commitment exerts statistically significant indirect effects on defend through\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 3. Mediation effects. Results are reported in terms of percentage points.\ninterest (0.718), reputation (1.382), and morality (1.368) (H1-H3). However, no such mechanism exists for identity.\nKeeping in mind the sequential ignorability assumption $^{12}$  expected of mediation analysis, we perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, resulting in a value of 0.4 for  $p$  across the significant moderators indicates that the results are robust against \"modest\" violations of the sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010). Consequently, our findings support our theoretical arguments. Reminded of their commitment to defend an ally, participants demonstrate a sense of shared national interests, concern over reputation, and a belief in the moral necessity of extending aid that increases their willingness to meet their obligations.\nHowever, given partisan polarization in the United States and its potential to color policy preferences , we felt it necessary to assess whether partisanship influenced our subjects' motivations. To test consistency across partisan affiliations, we replicate our analysis for each partisan grouping: Democrats  $(N = 715)$ , Republicans  $(N = 591)$ , and Independents  $(N = 118)$ .\nFigures 4-6 reveal a high degree of commonality across party affiliations. Democrats and Republicans cite underlying moral obligations and the need to preserve the reputation of the United States as shaping their policy\n#\nM. A. GOMEZ AND G. WINGER\nFigure 4. Mediation effects for democrats.\npreferences. This demonstrates that shared perceptions cross party lines. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that indirect effects through reputation are nearly twice as large for Democrats (1.824) compared to Republicans (0.930), with differences in morality not as pronounced (1.291; 1.763). Consequently, while Democrats and Republicans share perspectives (morality), these effects are not identical. Democrats value the United States' reputation significantly more than Republicans. This distinction corresponds with prevailing elite narratives, with Donald Trump continuing to champion an America First approach to world affairs and a disinterest in international opinion. At the same time, Biden emphasizes allies and partners as critical components of national security. Interestingly, independents adopt an exclusively instrumentalist logic grounded in the United States' strategic interests (3.708). This finding, however, is not definitive given the small number of independents. Nevertheless, this accounts for the limited effect of interest relative to morality and reputation when partisanship is not considered.\n# Conclusion: Call on Me\nKey characteristics of cyber conflict may facilitate shirking from mutual defense responsibilities. However, our findings show that many sentiments that undergird the desire to honor alliance commitments (Chu, Ko, and Liu 2021) apply to cyberspace and motivate people to aid allies victimized by cyber aggression. Reminding participants of existing alliance commitments significantly increased their willingness to aid partners. This finding indicates that expanding alliance mandates to include cyber conflict may be a significant factor for alliance reliability. Whereas leaders purposefully curtail alliance commitments to reduce the chances of needing to break them in the future (Chiba, Johnson, and Leeds 2015), the explicit extension of\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nFigure 5. Mediation effects for republicans.\nFigure 6. Mediation effects for independents.\nalliance obligations to include cyber incidents has the opposite effect. Even if an individual leader may be ambivalent about the merits of collective cyber defense, the need to uphold the commitment is an end. It provides a key motivator to aid an ally. Interestingly, this suggests that the explicit extension of alliance commitments to cyberspace is a boon for alliance reliability with potential hand-tying effects for current and future leaders.\nFurthermore, our analysis shows that concerns over national interests, reputation, and morality drive this readiness to honor alliance commitments to collective cyber defense. The prominent effect of reputation and morality suggests that the American public acutely recognizes the deleterious consequences of defection. These findings parallel similar studies of conventional conflict , indicating that while distinctions may exist between cyber and conventional operations , the fear that abandoning commitments will result in the loss of esteem endures.\nThat these effects resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans is also essential. Even though partisanship plays an increasingly significant role in guiding foreign policy attitudes, especially vis-à-vis United States' alliances , concern over the ignominy of abandoning allies spans the partisan divide and encourages fulfilling expectations. Morality and the belief that aiding allies after they have been attacked is the “right” thing to do appears to be a key point of convergence. This indicates that while Republican leaders express skepticism towards international commitments, and our findings do evidence Republicans having notably less concern over America's reputation, a distinction may exist between views of partners in peacetime versus during a crisis. Whereas concerns about burden-sharing, freeriding, and transactional diplomacy may pervade in peacetime, a foreign adversary's direct attack on an ally may have a galvanizing effect that resonates along ethical considerations and motivates even reticent Republicans to defend allies. Critically, this suggests that Republican questioning of the United States' alliances may not predict unreliability and should not be confused with an invitation to attack American allies. These effects endured despite the novelties of cyber conflict, give added support for alliance reliability and core commonalities about what motivates Democrats and Republicans alike to honor international commitments. However, while our study does indicate that wary Republicans may still be compelled to honor alliance commitments out of a sense of moral obligation, the question requires further study.\nLikewise, it is notable that of our four mediators, identity is distinct because it is the least meaningful for explaining our dependent variable. This result is potentially significant for indicating an underlying causal logic of alliance fulfillment that is self-interested rather than benevolent. Our participants appear motivated by the United States' interests, reputation, and moral standing, not camaraderie with the victim. Despite experimental treatments, the non-salience of identity remains where the victim was alternatively identified as either Japan or the United Kingdom. Such results may not be comforting for champions of “special relationships” but indicate an institutionalized understanding of mutual defense commitments. Rather than being predicated on the states involved, public sentiment is primarily informed by the salience of existing defense commitments and the costs of defection . This finding may also reassure allies like Albania, targeted by foreign cyberattacks but lacked a prominent bilateral relationship with the American public. In such cases, an alliance commitment matters more for American responsiveness than who the ally is. It signals a broader commitment to collective cybersecurity not contingent on national affinity.\nFurthermore, the necessity of fulfilling these collective cyber obligations resonates with the public and is a significant finding for democracies. The nature of political turnover in democratic governments can make them unreliable partners as successor regimes may not feel beholden to honor the commitments made by their political predecessors . However, the public feels that fulfilling alliance commitments following cyber conflict advances their interests and buoys the country's moral and reputational well-being -- creating a political mechanism that can compel future administrations into compliance (Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020).\nWhile our findings are significant, the study of how alliances feature in cyber conflicts is only beginning to take shape. We find three further avenues of research at the intersection of alliances and cyber conflict worth pursuing. As cyber conflict continues to grow as a feature of world affairs, we will gain more information about how alliances address such situations. This will afford us practical insights into the functionality of collective cybersecurity and a new avenue to test whether existing theories of alliance reliability  persist in the digital domain. While cooperation is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity , this is not limited solely to established alliances. Cyber conflict scholars must investigate whether variations in interstate relationships impact cooperation in this human-made space. Relatedly, the framing of elite messaging requires greater scrutiny. Although our experiment simply reminds participants of treaty commitments, elites may frame such dynamics with greater nuance to provide them with strategic flexibility when (not) responding . These elite cues may play a significant role in coloring widespread reactions to collective cybersecurity obligations and warrant further study. Despite these open questions, our article builds towards a more robust body of knowledge to better understand interstate behavior in this novel domain. Our findings suggest that by publicly expanding alliance defense commitments to include cyberattacks, leaders have also cultivated a powerful tool for ensuring alliance responsiveness through a widespread desire to honor those commitments and fear of what failing to aid allies may mean for one's own country.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nAlley, Joshua. 2023. “Elite Cues and Public Attitudes Towards Military Alliances.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 67 (7--8): 1537--1563. https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027221143963.\nBennis, Will M.

    "abstract": "International alliances have incorporated cybersecurity within their collective security mandates, but would these commitments be honored if invoked? Key characteristics of cyber conflict, including the non-physicality of cyber harms and the ambiguity of alliance obligations, may encourage shirking. Nevertheless, studies of alliance responsiveness suggest that while perfidy may be profitable, underlying concerns over interests, morality, national reputation, and shared identity can compel an ally to fulfill its obligations. To test whether these motivations extend into cyberspace, we conducted a survey experiment of 1,424 United States nationals exploring their response to a severe cyberattack against an allied state. We probe not only the willingness of our participants to retaliate on behalf of an ally but also the motives informing these reactions. We find that when reminded of alliance commitments, participants favor aiding allies and that this reaction is driven by concern over interests, morality, and reputation – but not identity.",
