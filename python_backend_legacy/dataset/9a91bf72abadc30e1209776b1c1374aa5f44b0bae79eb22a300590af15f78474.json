However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\n\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\n\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.",

Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\n\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend.

Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\n\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT.

Footnote 7\n\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\n\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\n\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.",

Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\n\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\n\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly",

Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\n\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\n\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\n\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\n\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security",

Footnote 26\n\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\n\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\n\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign",

Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\n\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\n\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\n\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\n\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\n\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns.

It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\n\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\n\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be",

Footnote 41\n\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\n\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45",

First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\n\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\n\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure.

            "markdown": "Secondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\n\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\n\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\n\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.",

            "markdown": "The DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\n\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\n\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\n\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.",

            "markdown": "Meanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\n\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\n\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\n\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\n\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities.",

  "full_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nDiscussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities.",

  "flat_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nDiscussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities.",

    "flat_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nDiscussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend. Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities.",

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend.

Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities."

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend.

Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities."

      "flat_text": "# Abstract\nFollowing a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges.\nPrevious article View issue table of contents Next article\nOver the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote  $^{1}$  the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote  $^{2}$  This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.\n# Japan Attacked, Questions Raised\nIn August 2011, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Japan's largest defence contractor, discovered viruses in its systems in eleven locations across Japan: forty-five servers and thirty-eight PCs had been infected by at least eight types of viruses when employees unwittingly opened emails containing APTs. Shortly thereafter, two other major space, defence and engineering contractors – IHI Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) – confirmed that they had been targeted. The revelations opened a floodgate of media attention to the issue of cyber-attacks as, in the following months, a series of government ministries and high-profile organisations, including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), also publicly admitted that they had been targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Footnote 3\nThe response of the JMoD to the 2011 attacks is instructive. When the news broke of the attacks on MHI, the JMoD reacted angrily, noting that it had only learned of MHI's troubles through the media. Quickly, the JMoD rewrote its supplier contracts, obligating contractors to immediately inform the JMoD of any security breaches; to compile a communication diagram to clarify who is in charge and who should be contacted in the event of a security breach; to implement 'full scans' using anti-virus software every week; to mandate continuous year-round monitoring; to preserve access records for at least three months; to strengthen encryption; and to audit the status of staff training on cyber-security. In October 2011, the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC) – Japan's top-level government cyber-security advisory body – set up a Subcommittee for Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation, which subsequently published a report urging the establishment of an all-government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to overcome stovepiping between different government agencies and organisations and the private sector. Footnote 4\n# Discussions surrounding cyber-security in Japan have raised wider questions about the use of force to deter and to defend.

Courtesy of Koji Sasahara/AP Photo\nYet Japan's key weapons-manufacturers have not been the only targets of cyber-attacks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) noted a six-fold increase in sophisticated spear-phishing attacks on leading corporations, research institutes and government departments between 2007 and 2011, reporting that in 2011, nearly 37 per cent of APTs focused on Japan's infrastructure, especially control systems such as those used in power plants and the manufacturing industry. Footnote 5 More recently, Kaspersky Lab suggested that an attack on Japan's Diet in 2011 was attributable to the 'Icefog' guerrilla APT. Footnote 6 Meanwhile, concern about such APTs and other threats to the integrity of critical national infrastructure has\nreached boiling point in recent years – not just within Japan but amongst its allies too, particularly the US. Footnote 7\nThe JMoD's response to the attacks on its suppliers in 2011 highlighted major questions about Japanese cyber-security policy and its institutional frameworks: the first being why Asia's top defence company, responsible for building some of the world's most advanced weapons platforms – including Lockheed Martin's F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter – along with IHI, had not implemented what might be considered basic cyber-security provisions. Footnote 8 The second question concerned the level of Japan's institutional preparedness to counter APTs. The JMoD's responses highlighted the extent of Japan's need, in 2011, for decisive leadership to both control and centralise cyber-security policy over disparate government entities and to tighten up defences with effective solutions. The remainder of this article shows just how much – or how little – progress has been made in these efforts, which have primarily focused on the JMoD.\n# Responses to the Changing Cyber-Security Environment\nTo some extent, Japanese policy over the past three years has been playing ‘catch-up’ in an attempt to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the 2011 MHI scandal, which could be described as a sort of ‘year zero’ for getting to grips with cyber-security. Japan's foundational IT policies date back to 2000, and the present institutional arrangements date back to 2005, when the National Information Security Center (NISC) and the ISPC were established (the latter deciding Japan's basic strategy for cyber-security under the Cabinet Office's IT Strategic Headquarters, while the former serves as the ISPC's secretariat). It was only in 2010, however, that Japan recognised for the first time the importance of preparing for and responding to large-scale cyber-attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure, mainly in response to the widespread attacks in 2009 on South Korea and the US, which were revealed to have used Japanese servers. Footnote 9 Also in 2010, Japan devolved responsibility for infrastructure protection to four competing institutions: the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), METI and the JMoD, each with their own budgeting processes, approaches and relationships with private industry, and characterised by a jumble of arrangements with cooperative bodies and policies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has recently been added to the list. Footnote 10\nWhile recognising the ineffectiveness of this arrangement in the wake of the 2011 APT attacks, it was only in 2013 that the NISC moved to institute further reform. Footnote 11 One key proposal has been to install the NISC within a more authoritative co-ordination body in the form of the Cyber Security Center, with a new focus on improving security for critical infrastructure. In addition, the ISPC has been involved in discussions regarding the possibility of monitoring Internet-based communications, which is forbidden under both Article 21 of the Japanese constitution and Article 4 of the Telecommunications Business Law.\nFurthermore, in 2012, Japan's National Police Agency set up a national Cyber Force Center to analyse cyber-attacks, assigning 140 staff in thirteen regional centres to monitor online posts, and to share and exchange information with over 4,000 companies, including those providing public services, such as electric power and gas, and high-tech companies. Footnote 12 The NISC established the Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team (CYMAT) to facilitate partnerships among ministries and agencies to further overcome stovepiping created by the different arrangements. Footnote 13 In October 2011, METI set up the Initiative for Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP) through which all of Japan's strategic sectors share information on cyber-attacks and policy. J-CSIP consists of sector-based groupings, from critical manufacturing infrastructure and defence companies, to the power, gas, oil and chemicals sectors along with several research institutes. Footnote 14 Further, in 2012, METI, MIC and four information security organisations set up the Cyber Attack Analysis Council (CAAC). Also since 2011, METI stepped up its working-level relationships with the US Departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense to share information. Footnote 15 Finally, to support the new agencies set up for the protection of critical infrastructure, in April 2013 Japan set up the Control System Security Center (CSSC) – a technology research association whose aim is to strengthen and authenticate cyber-security. Eighteen organisations have joined so far to support security verification and test facilities for industrial control systems with small-scale mock plants to simulate an electric-power system, a gas system, building automation, car production, sewage treatment, smart community and chemical-process automation. In the fiscal year 2013, these plants will be being utilised for hands-on simulation exercises. Footnote 16\n## International Defence Ties and Diplomacy\nInformation assurance and the confidence engendered (or not) by Japan's cyber-security provisions at the government and international level, both in terms of defence relationships and international diplomacy, are of direct and symbiotic relevance to the JMoD's own cyber-security provisions and policies, which are discussed in detail below. On the simplest level, beyond maintaining the security of networks and communications, top strategic importance is now accorded to securing the global supply chain, not least for military hardware and software. Footnote 17 This emphasis increased greatly after the US Defense Science Board revealed that it believed some of the US's most advanced weapons platforms – including the F-35 and Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System missile-defence systems, as well as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet combat fighter, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and the US Navy's littoral combat ship – had been compromised by cyber-espionage. Footnote 18\nInformation assurance has become all the more pertinent to Japan as it has boosted its defence ties with the US, whilst also forging deeper links with other nations it sees as increasingly\nimportant strategic partners, including the UK, as announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2013. Footnote 19 This became especially relevant in light of the October 2013 working-level discussions for bilateral defence co-operation – including cyber-security, maritime and space – at the second Japan–UK Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and British Foreign Secretary William Hague, which saw the announcement of the UK–Japan Defence Equipment Cooperation Framework and an Information Security Agreement. Footnote 20\nThe 2011 attacks also spurred MOFA to seek to better co-ordinate Japan's cyber-security policies internationally. That year, MOFA became more active in promoting international rules in line with US and European policy in an attempt to strengthen international norms of behaviour, supporting the US at key global policy meetings – for example, at the Budapest Conference on Cyberspace in October 2012. Footnote 21 Prior to this, in February 2012, MOFA placed cybersecurity under the control of an experienced ambassador, signalling its growing recognition of the importance of the issue. Footnote 22\nThis reinvigorated approach to cyber-security has slotted into Japan's other notable efforts to forge closer co-operative links with other strategic partners. In addition to the aforementioned ties with the UK, active collaboration has been established with members of ASEAN, Australia and India. Footnote 23 As part of a brand new policy announced by NISC in October 2013, Japan will also accelerate dialogues – such as the Japan-US IT Forum and the US-Japan Cyber Dialogue, in particular – to strengthen information sharing and increase joint training exercises between the JMoD and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Footnote 24\n# The JMoD and Cyber-Security\nAs noted, the JMoD's current cyber-security provisions have developed over the period since December 2000, when what was then the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) adopted guidelines that included information-security provisions. The MoD's first cyber-surveillance unit was set up in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), followed by other units within the Japan Ground and Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JGSDF and JMSDF). Footnote 25\nSince then, changes within the JMoD (the JDA until 2006) in response to pressures to alter its priorities and policy regarding information security have often been driven by US concerns about information assurance. This is reflected in the working-level Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI), launched in 2002 to establish common strategic objectives, together with successive Security Consultative Committee ‘2+2’ meetings (between the two countries’ defence and foreign ministers) to promote integration of the US and Japanese militaries, with a focus on integrating increasingly data-centric air defence, ballistic-missile defence, maritime security\noperations, surveillance, protection of critical infrastructure and mutual logistics support. Footnote 26\nThe years 2006–07 saw further major changes to the JMoD's information-security provisions, driven by concerns over stovepiping between the different cyber-defence systems of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF – that is, over the lack of co-ordination, under a single command, of the work of the three services’ separate cyber-surveillance units. Footnote 27 In April 2006, Japan and the US agreed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Cooperation Regarding Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. Footnote 28 In August 2007, Japan signed the ‘General Security of Military Information Agreement’ (GSOMIA) to bolster the exchange of military information with the US. The May 2007 2+2 meeting committed the US and Japan to the routine sharing of ballistic-missile defence and related operational information directly on a real-time, continuous basis, all of which required the JMoD to update and bolster its cyber-security arrangements. Footnote 29 Meanwhile, in 2007 the JMoD set up a combined command – the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) – to tackle threats, Footnote 30 and in March 2008, the JMoD and Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) inaugurated the SDF C4 (command, control, communications and computers) System Command. Footnote 31\nToday, the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP), for fiscal years 2011–15, and the ‘six pillars’ of cyber-defence established in the 2010 defence White Paper form the JMoD's baseline for cyber-security and defence policy. This MTDP was the first to feature cyber-defence in some detail, and the first to identify cyberspace as a new and major security challenge, adding this to outer space, maritime security and climate change as a focus for Japanese-US co-operation. In terms of cyber-strategy, as part of a Dynamic Defense Force able to adjust to fast-paced technical change, the MTDP promoted the strengthening of network protection systems as part of a ‘whole Japanese government’ effort, and led to the development of cyber-defence capabilities and doctrines within the SDF, as well as proposals for a unified command-and-control system – now known as the Cyber Defense Unit (CDU) – to strengthen the SDF's response to cyber-attacks. Footnote 32\nRemarkably, despite the attempts to enhance information-security provisions, cyber-defence and strategy had received barely a mention in the JMoD's annual White Papers up to 2010. As such, in line with the broader, whole-of-government efforts by the NISC described earlier, and the growing recognition of the seriousness and pervasiveness of cyber-security threats – particularly APTs – from 2010, the JMoD instituted a major overhaul of its cyber-security provisions. The White Paper of that year was the first to focus on the critical importance of cyber-security and national defence, citing the June 2009 attacks on South Korea and the US; cyber-attacks in the conflicts between Israel and Hizbullah in 2006, and between Israel and Hamas in 2008; and cyber-attacks against Georgia in 2008 as evidence that the SDF must bolster its cyber-defence capabilities. The White Paper was also the first to point to international moves by foreign\nmilitaries as reference points for policy formulation, noting the US Cyberspace Policy Review of May 2009 and its establishment of a cyber-security co-ordinator; the establishment of the US Cyber Command to oversee the DoD's cyber-warfare operations in June 2009; and the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review that listed cyberspace as one of the global commons and defined cyber-warfare capabilities as one of six key mission areas. Further to this, the White Paper highlighted the formation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), Australia's establishment of a cyber-warfare unit – the Cyber Security Operations Centre – and South Korea's establishment of a Cyber Command for cyber-warfare. Footnote 33\nIn addition to outlining arrangements for the CDU, establishing a co-ordinator for cyber planning for the Joint Staff Office and asking the country's Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH) to conduct long-term specialist research into cyber-warfare trends, the White Paper also focused, for the first time, on specific cyber-security implementation plans. These were based on 'six pillars': introducing intrusion-prevention systems; developing cyber-defence analysis systems; enacting regulations establishing postures and procedures for responding to cyber-attacks; training cyber-specialists; 'driving' information-sharing with NISC and other organisations; and conducting research and development (R&amp;D) on the latest technology. Footnote 34\nAn analysis of the JMoD's emerging cyberspace policy and provisions reveals the importance placed on observing developments by peer militaries and allies – notably the US, NATO, South Korea and the UK – in Japan's attempts to catch up with its peers. Indeed, the framing and reference points for the JMoD's cyber-strategy are clearly based on monitoring of and reflections on the approaches of allies, as well as on mounting US pressure with regard to Japan's cyber-security policy and practices. In this respect, they have been reactive rather than proactive.\nHowever, the JMoD's efforts in this regard may have been stymied by difficulties in obtaining funding, as well as by legal barriers and constitutional restrictions. A small-scale CDU, for example, is finally to be set up in 2014, after successive years of refusals by the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the unit.\nMoreover, JMoD defence White Papers are remarkable for both what they do and do not say about cyber-security awareness, policy and progress. Following the June 2010 2+2 meeting in Washington, DC, which stated boosting trilateral co-operation between Japan, the US and South Korea and between Japan, the US and Australia to be a primary objective, space and cyberspace co-operation appeared for the first time as important agenda items, amidst US concerns about drawing Japan further into next-generation interoperability, entailing closer co-operation on intelligence, surveillance, maritime security and extended deterrence.\nReflecting this, the subsequent White Paper, 'Defense of Japan 2011', placed cyberspace threats higher than the more traditional proliferation of WMD and international terrorism as security concerns. Footnote 35 This document was also the first to mention the use of Stuxnet, and further\nelucidated the JMoD's rationale for focusing on cyber-defence, noting the need to respond to the growing integration and centralisation of peer governments' efforts; the expansion of the powers and budgets of intelligence agencies in peer countries; the growth in number of policy and research institutes worldwide dealing with cyber-security issues; and the need to strengthen international co-operation. It also noted other countries' moves to fold the cyber-security of infrastructure into national defence policy. Footnote  $^{36}$  Meanwhile, for the first time, the White Paper touched on the difficulties involved in attribution, deterrence and response, noting the lack of agreement across the international community with regard to the recognition of cyber-attacks as 'armed' attacks, thereby making it difficult to apply existing rules of engagement and creating a gap in terms of behavioural norms. Footnote  $^{37}$\nAs noted, it was only in 2012 that the Japanese government publicly elucidated its preliminary response to cyber-attacks, for the first time acknowledging the status of cyberspace as an operational domain under international law, and thereby Japan's right to self-defence in that domain. In January 2012, Koichiro Gemba became the first serving foreign minister to attend an ISPC meeting; in April he talked about the relationship between cyber-attacks and international law, which the media interpreted as a declaration of Japan's right to self-defence against cyber-attacks under existing international law, including the UN Charter. Footnote  $^{38}$  Following this, in July 2012, the JMoD released its 'Defense Posture Review Interim Report', which cited strengthening intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities as the top priority, with response to cyber-attacks, promoting the use of outer space and strengthening maritime security also amongst the list of ten priorities. Footnote  $^{39}$\nSubsequently, in September 2012 the ministry's cyber-defence strategy took two steps forward. First, the JMoD released its first openly stated preliminary doctrine on cyber-defence, in the document 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. Second, in the wake of the Liberal Democratic Party's return to power in December 2012, the ministry requested 21.2 billion yen to finally set up the CDU. Footnote  $^{40}$  Once established, the CDU, also called the Joint Cyber Special Command, will report directly to the defence minister and will control the JGSDF System Protect Unit, the JMSDF Communications Security Group and the JASDF Computer Security Evaluation Unit, taking overall responsibility for the full SDF DII Network and Central Command System, under the overall responsibility of a cyber-security co-ordinator in the Joint Staff Office. (Hitherto, each service has defended its own systems under the co-ordination of the C4 Systems Command.)\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' sets out the foundational rationale underpinning the SDF's and the JMoD's emerging cyber-strategy. It defines cyberspace, notes its vital importance to Japan's infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, and formally recognises it as an operational domain. It also lays out the bare bones of an operational doctrine, stating that in the event of a cyber-attack occurring as part of an armed attack, the JMoD and SDF will be\ntasked with responding to only – and this is a crucial caveat – in so far as the cyber-attack is against the JMoD's and SDF's own systems. Footnote 41\nThe document also states that if a cyber-attack takes place as part of a military attack, this can be considered as fulfilling the first condition for invoking the right of self-defence. It also defines cyber-attacks as attacks that can endanger the core infrastructure of the military. While careful to state that online attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis, the JMoD's position thus makes Japan's right to respond to hostile attacks against its infrastructure clear. It also states that considerations for future meetings will include establishing a more nuanced legal framework for dealing with online attacks, and progress in the establishment of the CDU.\n'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace' also laid out four 'high priority' and five 'priority' programmes to bulk up the Japanese cyber-defence posture, fleshing out previous initiatives, particularly provisions for the CDU. Yet while infrastructure protection figures prominently in the document, the policy lacks decisive new features. The document states that the JMoD will dispatch staff to the Government Security Operation Coordination team and participate 'more fully' in the CYMAT, yet it then also claims that 'at present' the JMoD can only raise the security level of defence-industry companies through the sort of arrangements laid out in 2011 and increased information-sharing with private-sector partners about how to decrease supply-chain risks, for example. Footnote 42\nMeanwhile, the doctrine makes much of the importance of strengthening co-operation with allies, especially with the US. As mentioned in the June 2011 2+2 joint statement, the JMoD is committed to promoting a bilateral strategic policy dialogue with the US on cyber-security and strengthening bilateral co-operation on issues such as information-sharing and improving joint response capability through bilateral exercises that assume a cyber-environment degraded by cyber-attacks. Strengthened co-operation with the UK, Australia, Singapore and NATO was also among the stated aims.\n'Defense of Japan 2013', the JMoD's most recent White Paper, builds on the doctrine outlined in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace', noting that cyber-attacks on government and military networks, as well as on critical infrastructure, can significantly affect national security. Footnote 43 It refers to government and military efforts to address the threat by Australia, NATO, South Korea, the UK and the US, Footnote 44 and, again, clearly defines cyberspace, including its status as a domain. It also seeks to bolster the JMoD's stance with a long and detailed summary of the scale and nature of cyber-warfare and APT threats, noting, for instance, that China's People's Liberation Army and the Russian and North Korean military, intelligence and security agencies are all involved in cyber-attacks, with North Korea allegedly training personnel on a national scale. It also cites increasing concerns about supply-chain risks. Footnote 45\nFinally, in what may turn out to be a critical turning point for US– Japan cyber-security cooperation, and perhaps cementing Japan's position as a net contributor to global cyber-security, the October 2013 Tokyo 2+2 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida and Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera produced two potentially highly important, forward-looking deliverables. First, Japan and the US declared that they would move forward with enabling Japan to develop ‘collective cyber-defence’ capabilities following moves by the Abe administration to allow Japan to engage in limited forms of collective defence. Footnote 46 Secondly, the partners agreed to establish a Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) to promote cyber co-operation, which was seen as a major achievement by the two countries’ respective defence establishments and governments. Footnote 47\n# The JMoD's Cyber-Security Provisions\nBased on the current MTDP, and using the actions of allies and peers as reference points, the JMoD is taking significant steps in establishing both an integrated cyber-defence command and doctrine. Nonetheless, it could be argued that even this is too little, and that the JMoD's scope for action is severely hampered both by its institutional limitations and constitutional constraints.\nIndeed, first, while the JMoD – similarly to its counterparts in the US and, for example, South Korea – has moved to establish an integrated and specialised CDU, progress has been very slow. Expected to become fully operational by the spring of 2014, it has proven difficult to identify a sufficient number of staff to be internally transferred and trained as specialists. Hiroshi Itoh, an intelligence specialist and retired colonel who served for twenty-seven years in the JGSDF and set up its initial cyber-defence unit, has stated publicly that the CDU still needs at least several hundred specialists, with at least a portion of them white-hat hackers recruited from the private sector. Footnote 48 Such inadequacies become apparent when the CDU is compared to its South Korean equivalent, which is reported to have a staff of 400 and to be actively training and incentivising over thirty specialists annually, against an allegedly 3,000-strong cyber-warrior unit in North Korea. Footnote 49 US Cyber Command is reportedly planning to recruit 4,000 cyberwarriors, including white-hat hackers, into three teams: National Mission Forces for critical infrastructure protection; Combat Mission Forces to respond or implement cyber-attacks of their own; and Cyber Protection Forces to boost network defences. Footnote 50 On a deeper level, Japan is said to need a further 80,000 technical experts, a gap that has lead ISPC member Motohiro Tsuchiya to call for Japan to actively recruit its own cadre of ‘patriotic hackers’ to counter overseas counterparts. Footnote 51 While the JMoD is now sending personnel for training in the US and is increasingly active in US cyber-war games, the overall impression is that the CDU's funding, size, personnel and posture raise questions about its ability to protect the JMoD's IT infrastructure. Footnote 52\nSecondly, JMoD policy has failed to initiate decisive new steps for infrastructure protection, only providing for deeper co-operation with other organisations to mitigate supply-chain risks. As noted, with the proliferation of bodies and organisations charged with protecting the nation's infrastructure noted above, the JMoD remains only a bit player in the defence of Japan's critical infrastructure, as is made clear in 'Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace'. This is a legacy of Japan's system of tatewari gyosei ('segmented bureaucracy'), in which competing bureaucracies have their own policies and programmes to protect critical infrastructure, which are only co-ordinated by the NISC. As in 2011, when it forced its principal equipment and services contractors to reinforce their own cyber-security provisions, the JMoD will try to keep its own neighbourhood in order, but is also reliant on other bureaucracies to tackle broader supply-chain and other risks.\nWhile interdepartmental co-operation is progressing, as shown most recently by the foundation of the CSSC, Japan's cyber-security policy still relies most heavily on the individual initiative of each ministry. How much and how successfully the new Cyber Security Center will be able to rationalise these approaches remains a key question. Legal changes need to be made to allow the SDF to protect critical civilian infrastructure in the case of an emergency: for example, the SDF Law, which already covers disaster recovery by the SDF in specific cases such as nuclear disasters and the need to transport Japanese citizens from abroad, could be extended to cover cyber-threats.\nThirdly, as the JMoD's cyber-defence doctrine makes clear, Japan is clearly hampered by Article 9 of its constitution and its highly circumscribed ability to mount collective defence for computer-network warfare, and as such remains reliant on the US.\nThis can be seen on several levels. JMoD doctrine falls far behind the active US cyber-defence doctrine – part of the DoD's doctrine of cyberspace superiority – which is now, following the July 2011 ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’, a primary mission of US forces. In the strategy, the DoD defined active cyber-defence as the ‘DoD's synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyse, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities’. Footnote 53 Currently, the JMoD seems to have no clear doctrine to guide a move from passive defence to active cyber-defence. Footnote 54 However, passive defence is increasingly vulnerable to APTs. The Mandiant report quoted earlier found that only 6 per cent of organisations detect advanced attackers via internal methods. During 2011, for example, 94 per cent of victims learned that they had been victims of cyberattacks from an external entity, and the median number of days between the emergence of the first evidence of compromise to the identification of an attack was 416. Footnote 55 Clearly, early detection and pushing out the perimeters of defence is more effective than passively sitting back and dealing with attacks, yet this is one area where the JMoD, with its current levels of staffing and funding, seems least able to act.\nThe DoD's 'Cyberspace Policy Report' of November 2011, meanwhile, laid out rationales and policies for computer-network warfare. The document asserts that the US 'reserves the right to respond using all necessary means to defend our Nation, our Allies, our partners, and our interests ... in cyberspace', noting that 'response options may include using cyber and/ or kinetic capabilities provided by [the] DoD', including offensive operations, which would seem to include defending Japan. It also outlines doctrine dealing with escalation, and the DoD has also said it implemented standing rules of engagement for the operation and defence of its networks.\nBy contrast, stated JMoD doctrine is still only partially formed. It effectively limits the CDU's operational parameters to a defensive role designed only to 'counter' and 'suppress' cyberattacks, 'deny' an opponent the use of cyberspace during an attack, and enable the SDF to 'quickly recover'. Nor does it define 'armed attack'. Interestingly, the US regards sabotage against critical infrastructure – for example, causing a nuclear reactor to melt down – as 'use of force' in cyberspace; the JMoD, by contrast, is unclear as to where to draw its lines.\nJMoD policy states that 'it can be assumed that the first requirement of exercising the right of self-defence will be met in the event of a cyber attack as part of an armed attack and that the JMoD continues to study both international and domestic legal issues'. However, establishing what constitutes an armed cyber-attack – which should be determined 'based on circumstances', according to JMoD policy – is fraught with difficulties. For example, a consensus has arisen within the legal and military spheres that certain cyber-operations constitute a prohibited use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, yet it is hard to know in advance which criteria states will employ in deciding what type of cyber-attack qualifies. There are several analytical frameworks that assess the point at which cyber-operations constitute a use of force, but beyond the public emergence of Stuxnet in particular, there have been few peacetime examples of state-sponsored cyber-coercion involving physical damage. Footnote 56 Broadly speaking, based on the 'Schmitt analysis', Footnote 57 the US view that cyber-operations resulting in physical damage or injury will almost always be regarded as use of force is gaining growing acceptance. Footnote 58\nAs noted, therefore, JMoD guidelines stipulate that if a cyber-attack occurs as part of an armed offensive strike, the situation warrants exercising the nation's right to self-defence – although, as noted, ‘Each situation will be judged on a case-by-case basis’. The policy is also unclear with regard to which actions the CDU may take to pre-empt an attack, or to the operational role it could play, for example, during a pre-emptive conventional (or kinetic) attack. It is therefore also unclear what the relationship is between JMoD doctrine and the forthcoming proposals by the Abe administration to allow limited forms of collective defence. Thus, the JMoD's operational functionality, even with regard to cyber-capabilities, is clearly limited and is only applicable for in defence, in line with constitutional restraints.\nMeanwhile, the JMoD's doctrine on deterrence is also unclear, but this is unsurprising given the classic problem of attribution and the fact that offense is dominant. The JMoD defines deterrence as punishment against attacks that will cause damage on an equal or greater scale than the damage caused by the original attack, and deterrence by denial. Yet deterrence is difficult when an attacker is not a state actor and does not possess assets that can be threatened. Attribution thus remains a fundamental issue. As the JMoD has not reached a consensus as to its definition of cyber-attacks and the status of such attacks under international law, including the recognition of cyber-attacks as armed attacks, it can only state that it is difficult to apply its existing rules of engagement in response to cyber-attacks.\nGiven the anonymity of cyber-attacks, warnings of retaliation seem doctrinally immature without the advanced capability required to counterattack. Such capability presupposes that the JMoD has prepared an offensive network operations plan, which may be counter to Japan's constitution. Japan would have to make legal amendments to allow the use of a cyber-weapon, as it could violate legislation that makes the manufacture of a computer virus illegal.\nInstead, the JMoD appears limited to deterrence by denial. However, given the opponent's likely superiority and possible (or probable) anonymity, it is hard to see how the JMoD can improve security levels to the point of deterring such adversaries. In this light, the JMoD's current policy of seeking to influence the opponent's cost calculus in favour of ceasing an attack through threats to cause 'unbearable damage' or to influence the opponent's estimate of goal-attainment possibility based on its capability to physically deny a specific attack seems patently unsatisfactory. Therefore, within this maze, the way in which the JMoD can realistically deter an adversary, to what extent it can counterattack and when it can conduct pre-emptive operations are fundamental questions to which the answers are not yet clear.\nGiven these limitations, it seems unlikely that the JMoD could engage in collective cyber-defence that is 'robust enough to address high-end threats, yet nimble enough to address normal, low-end, peacetime threats', as postulated by the Council on Foreign Relations. Footnote 59\nHowever, Japan's role in collective cyber-defence need not be hamstrung by the limitations of the capabilities of the JMoD. The progress made by the four organisations involved in critical infrastructure protection to date could allow Japan to play an important role in developing standards for control systems, as well as early warning and detection – that is, a more traditional form of forward supporting role that is increasingly becoming the norm with regard to Japan's international peacekeeping activities."

    "abstract": "Following a series of shocks that rocked Japan's confidence in its cyber-security provisions, in April 2014 the Japanese Ministry of Defense will finally set up a unified command to deal with cyber-security threats. However, many issues, including the role of Japan's military in the protection of critical national infrastructure and the nation's cyber-warfare doctrine, have yet to be finalised. Paul Kallender examines recent policy and posture changes by the Ministry of Defense as it tries to get to grips with new and changing cyber-security challenges. Previous article View issue table of contents Next article Over the last three years, following the increased targeting of Japan, and in particular its defence contractors, by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Footnote $^{1}$ the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has taken important steps to bolster its cyber-security in line with broader attempts by the government of Japan to do the same. Since 2010, the JMoD has not only published a cyber-defence doctrine; it has also begun to set up a unified command, in the form of a Cyber Defense Unit (CDU), to deal with cyber-security issues. While the US-Japan Security Treaty forms the foundation of Japan's and the JMoD's security strategy, this increased focus on the cybersphere comes as Japan and the Japanese military are forging a variety of closer, more multi-layered international security and cyber security-related ties with increasingly important partners, such as Australia and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and – further afield – with the UK. Against the backdrop of Japan's growing global importance and footprint in terms of defence, the efficacy of the country's cyber-security provisions and policies, and those of the JMoD in particular, is an issue of increasing significance. Footnote $^{2}$ This article shows that, to some degree, the JMoD's cyber-security stance and policies (and those of Japan in general) have often been driven by concerns over information assurance, particularly following pressure from Japan's key ally, the US. Indeed, as Japan seeks to play a greater role in international defence manufacturing, information assurance has never been more critical. Yet the JMoD continues to face significant problems in its attempts to protect its own networks more effectively, to ensure the data integrity of its suppliers and, more broadly, to protect Japan's critical infrastructure. As such, this article examines the recent progress made by the JMoD in improving the country's cyber-defences, in the context of national cyber-security policy in this regard, concluding that the JMoD's current provisions need to go much further in order to improve not only information assurance but also Japan's ability to deter cyber-attacks and defend the nation.",
