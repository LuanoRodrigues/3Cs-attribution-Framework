The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals.¹ The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation.² Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'.³ However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author.⁴ Although there are no official\n¹ Stuxnet exploits four different vulnerabilities, a previously unheard of level of complexity in malware.

Ibid.\n³ 'Iran Says Cyber Foes Caused Centrifuge Problems', Reuters, 29 November 2010; 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage', BBC News, 29 November 2010. Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n⁴ In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces.

Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n5 Albright, Brannan and Walrond, ISIS Stuxnet Report; Kim Zetter, ‘Report Strengthens Suspicion That Stuxnet Sabotaged Iran’s Nuclear Plant’, Wired 27 December 2010, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/isis-report-on-stuxnet/# (last accessed 13 February 2011).\n6 Zetter, ‘Surveillance Footage and Code Clues Indicate Stuxnet Hit Iran’.\n7 William J. Broad and David E. Sanger, ‘Worm Was Perfect for Sabotaging Centrifuges’, New York Times (New York), 18 November 2010, A1. The worm targets frequency converters, a type of power supply that changes its output frequency to control the speed of a motor.\n8 See Chapter 1 above, and Appendix 1 for a description of this event.\n9 A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) uses many compromised computers to flood a target system with requests for information until it collapses under the strain. The compromised computers are usually ones that have been recruited to a botnet (usually without their owner’s knowledge) and are controlled by a master computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n39\nstate like Estonia that depends on the internet for everything from parking to banking to voting, the attacks caused serious disruption and caused an estimated tens of millions of euros' worth of damage.¹⁰ Despite earlier explicit accusations that the Russian Federation was behind the offensive,¹¹ the Estonian government backed away from directly accusing the Kremlin of launching the attacks,¹² but requested assistance from its NATO allies under the terms of that alliance. Although no official statement regarding the cyber attacks was released by NATO, one of the clearest indications of the member states' views on computer network attacks came from Estonian defence minister Jaak Aaviksoo, who raised the matter with NATO:\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.¹³\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks;¹⁴ however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government;¹⁵ the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations.

Russia categorically denies any involvement and subsequent reports have found no concrete evidence to substantiate the claims. While technical data shows that some of the attacks came from IP addresses allocated to the Russian government, there is no evidence that these computers were involved in initiating the attacks, or that they had not been compromised or spoofed.\n¹³ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 17 May 2007, Home 1.\n¹⁴ See generally, Chapter 3 below.\n¹⁵ Charles Clover, ‘Kremlin-Backed Group Behind Estonia Cyber Blitz’, *Financial Times* (London), 11 March 2009, 8, www.ft.com/techblog (last accessed 27 October 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontroversies surrounding the rule prohibiting the use of force had tended to focus on issues such as the conditions for self-defence or the existence of a right to humanitarian intervention,¹⁶ the advent of computer network attacks has renewed a far more fundamental question: what is the meaning of ‘force’ in the twenty-first century?\nThe prohibition of the use of force is one of the cornerstones of international law and is expressed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter:\nAll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\nHowever, the prohibition is not restricted to the Charter; the International Court of Justice has repeatedly noted that it represents not only a principle of customary international law but also a ‘fundamental or cardinal principle of such law’.¹⁷ The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens.¹⁸ However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.¹⁹\n## 1. Force defined as armed force\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n¹⁶ Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n¹⁷ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference.²⁰ Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force.²¹ As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again.²² Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.²³\n## The Charter wording\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n²⁰ Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n²¹ See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n²² For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n²³ Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’.²⁴ Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’.²⁵ Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations.²⁶ Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n²⁴ Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n²⁵ The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n²⁶ Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law.²⁷ Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected.²⁸ Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention.²⁹ The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’.³⁰ Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.³¹\n²⁷ Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n²⁸ ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n²⁹ D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33]\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n[33] 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n[34] James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011). It should also be noted that these discussions took place prior to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n[35] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAn examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n³⁸ Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n³⁹ W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n⁴⁰ Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war.⁴¹ Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties.⁴² He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.⁴³\n## Subsequent iterations of the rule\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code,⁴⁴ a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.⁴⁵ Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.⁴⁶\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.⁴⁷\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n⁴¹ Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n⁴² Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n⁴³ Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n⁴⁴ Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n⁴⁵ The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations.

Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS.⁴⁹ It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable;⁵⁰ if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.⁵¹\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations).⁵² The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited.⁵³ However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n⁴⁸ Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n⁵⁰ Richard W.

The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups.⁵⁶ This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States.⁵⁷ This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.⁵⁸\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n⁵⁴ UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc.

Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n⁵⁸ It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n49\nthe Non-Use of Force.⁵⁹ As with previous General Assembly resolutions, the Declaration separates the concepts of armed intervention and economic and political coercion; however, it leaves the main controversies between developed and developing states unsettled.⁶⁰\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case,⁶¹ claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania.⁶² The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’.⁶³ Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.⁶⁴\n⁵⁹ Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n65 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 209.\n66 Ibid., para. 193.\n67 Ibid., para. 228.\n68 Ibid., para. 191. Much criticism has been directed at the Nicaragua (Merits) decision based on this elucidation of various levels of force, particularly from American authors. See, for example, the panel discussion reported at American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision' (1987) 81 ASIL Proc. 258.\n69 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 191.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n51\nself-determination of that right to self-determination and freedom and independence.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n70 Again the Court's approach in using the Declaration has been controversial. Some authors argue that the Court has used the Declaration as a source of law, a position which the states parties to the resolution would never have intended. Authors have also criticised the Court for using the text of the Declaration as indicative of opinio juris of the international community without also fully examining the actions of states: see generally, American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision'. But cf. Lori Fisler Damrosch, 'Politics across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence over Domestic Affairs' (1989) 83 AJIL 1, 8.\n71 This is in accord with the drafting history of Article 3g of the Definition of Aggression which rejected a proposal to include several of the broad range of activities listed as indirect aggression in the Declaration on Friendly Relations. See Pierluigi L. Zanardi, 'Indirect Military Aggression' in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation on the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 111-19, 116.\n72 The indirectness of computer network attacks is addressed in section 3.1.1 below.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n73 Damrosch, ‘Politics across Borders’, 10.\n74 Case Concerning the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran) (1980) 74 AJIL 746, International Court of Justice, para. 59. In that case the Ayatollah had made several public declarations inveighing against the United States and holding the US responsible for the trouble besetting that country. On 1 November the Ayatollah had made a statement declaring it was ‘up to the dear pupils, students and theological students to expand with all their might their attacks against the United States and Israel, so that they may force the United States to return the deposed and Criminal Shah, and to condemn this great plot’. Further, congratulatory statements from the Ayatollah following the attack and other statements of official approval were also made.\n75 Presumably because of the lack of imputability to a state party.\n76 Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 7.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n53\nforce in Article 2(4). In setting out the area covered by the prohibition against force, the Court stated that Article 2(4) of the Charter represented only part of the customary international law relating to the use of force and stated that the UN Charter 'by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of the use of force in international relations'.[77] The Court pointed out that the right to self-defence stood alongside the Charter and that the Charter text did not go on to regulate all of the aspects of that rule. Bearing that in mind, we need now to turn to state practice and the theories of force propounded by other academics.\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n79 For example, the US called the attacks 'unacceptable' and 'pressure on an independent country' but stopped short of calling the attacks force: 'Rice Condemns Ongoing Cyber-Attacks as Estonian Embassy Siege Ends', earthtimes.org 4 May 2007.\n80 AFP, 'Cyber Attacks on Estonia Are Security Issue: NATO Chief', The Age (Melbourne), 26 May 2007.\n81 'The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia', BBC News, 17 May 2007. As noted previously, responsibility for the attacks has been claimed by a member of the Russian 'Nashi' youth group, stating that the attacks were carried out without state involvement. The attribution has not been confirmed.\n82 V. I.

China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet.⁸⁷ Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.⁸⁸ In September 2002 China announced that it had developed five new information warfare\n⁸⁴ Ibid.\n⁸⁵ See, for example, McAfee, *Virtual Criminology Report*, McAfee Inc.

Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks.⁹² The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’⁹³ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.⁹⁴\n⁸⁹ ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n⁹⁰ Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n⁹¹ Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n⁹² Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n⁹³ Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁴ Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Statements by NATO officials have been careful to frame NATO's cyber defence actions within Article 4 relating to consultation in response to threats to territorial integrity, political independence or national security rather than Article 5 collective self-defence.⁹⁵\nInternational reaction to the Stuxnet worm has also been decidedly muted, although this attack is perhaps the clearest example to date of a computer network attack amounting to a use of force (if not an armed attack). Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation.⁹⁶ While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.⁹⁷\n⁹⁵ Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁶ 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n⁹⁷ As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors. Because of their clandestine nature, computer network attacks are perfect fodder for rumours and misinformation; for example, Chinese hackers have been inaccurately blamed for causing a massive blackout in the north-eastern United States in 2003.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one.⁹⁸ The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property.⁹⁹ Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury.¹⁰⁰ The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter.¹⁰¹ In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’.¹⁰² However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm.¹⁰³ Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n⁹⁸ For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n⁹⁹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n¹⁰⁰ Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n¹⁰¹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362. ¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ See also Todd A.

Used in this manner, the term war is merely used to signify resolve,¹⁰⁴ a point that has been noted by legal commentators and politicians alike.¹⁰⁵ Thus the semantics of war and weaponry are no longer useful criteria in determining whether something is a use of force.¹⁰⁶ Further, as was seen in the 2001 anthrax scares in the United States and the release of sarin gas on a Tokyo subway train in 1995, the requirement of a weapons-based delivery system is not essential for a chemical or biological attack. The International Court of Justice has also noted in its advisory opinion on Nuclear Weapons that the provisions relating to the use of force in the Charter do not refer to specific weapons but rather apply to the use of force regardless of the weapons employed.¹⁰⁷\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’.¹⁰⁸ In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n¹⁰⁴ Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.¹¹⁰\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force.¹¹¹ He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:¹¹²\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify,¹¹³ it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n¹⁰⁹ Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n¹¹⁰ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n¹¹¹ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n¹¹² Ibid.\n¹¹³ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n61\nadoption by the international community.¹¹⁴ However, it is also equally clear that the requirement and current analysis with regard to weaponry cannot stand as it is and must be revisited if it is to take into account changes in technology.\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale.¹¹⁵ McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.¹¹⁶\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority.¹¹⁷ He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order.¹¹⁸ That is, the critical\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 917.\n¹¹⁵ Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 153.\n¹¹⁷ These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n¹¹⁸ Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n62 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order.¹¹⁹ However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity.¹²⁰ The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n¹¹⁹ Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n¹²⁰ Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n63\n'armed force' leads towards an erosion of the exclusion of economic and political coercion. Michael Schmitt has suggested that the use of force proscription is based on the desire of the international community to foster and advance the aspirational values set out in the preamble to the Charter. The prohibition on 'armed' force is thus a kind of instrumental shorthand way to restrict those acts that are most likely to endanger those objectives and aims. Schmitt argues that the international community is not concerned so much with the instrumentality of the coercion but rather the consequences of its use.¹²¹ However, given that the range of possible consequences of any given kind of attack (i.e. denial of service, virus, direct intrusions etc.) range along a continuum, assessing the consequences of an attack can be a Sisyphean task, making the criteria for placement upon that continuum extremely difficult.\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.¹²²\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:¹²³\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n¹²¹ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n¹²² Ibid. ¹²³ Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n64 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy.¹²⁴ He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n¹²⁴ Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n65\nlaw on the use of force and the law applicable in armed conflict, it was essential to take account of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons.¹²⁵ The same approach may be adopted in respect of computer network attacks.\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.¹²⁶\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n¹²⁵ Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n¹²⁶ Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n67\nthe attacks against Estonia in 2007; although computers inside the Kremlin were used in the attacks, subsequent analysis of the attacks concluded that those computers could well have been compromised by the groups of patriotic hackers generally believed to be responsible for the attacks.¹³⁰ Thus the indirectness of the attack obfuscates the true perpetrator of the attack, and increases the risk that countermeasures may be directed at innocent parties. While this may be viewed as a desirable effect by an attacking state in that it permits a high level of plausible deniability, such opacity makes the task of determining the correct legal standard to apply while the attack is ongoing that much harder.\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n¹³⁰ See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n69\nThat is, a weapon is anything that directly causes physical damage and human injury. Jacobson has argued that ‘armed’ simply means equipped with weapons of war, and that weapons are tools designed to accomplish a specific mission.¹³² Brownlie’s approach was to fit the new technology to the definition. Given that a purely results-based approach does not provide the appropriate distinction between armed and other forms of coercion without reference to some other factors, those who adopt an instrument-based analysis argue the means of producing the results are still significant. That is, if a computer network attack does not meet some form of weapons criterion then it is likely that the use of such attack techniques will fall within the levels of coercion currently occupied by political and economic coercion. Where these attacks take place during an armed conflict, such acts will be seen as part of the ongoing conflict, and will be judged accordingly;¹³³ however, it is worth emphasising that, in this instance, these issues are raised in relation to the exercise of such force by an actor of the state before the commencement of traditional military action.\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force.¹³⁴ He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.¹³⁵\n¹³² Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n¹³³ For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n¹³⁴ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136]\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n71\nby the host state.¹³⁸ Further, the actions of the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel case were held to be a policy of force even though the strait concerned was of the ‘class of international highways through which passage cannot be prohibited’.¹³⁹\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China.¹⁴⁰ Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident.¹⁴¹ DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n¹³⁸ See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n¹³⁹ Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n¹⁴⁰ See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n¹⁴¹ Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict.¹⁴² There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state,¹⁴³ so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law.¹⁴⁴ The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, the main\n¹⁴² See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n¹⁴³ For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n¹⁴⁴ See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n¹⁴⁵ For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n¹⁴⁶ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n73\npurpose of the computer network attack may be the denial, corruption or exploitation of the information target itself. For example, the Israeli attacks against the Syrian air defence radar system which allowed their fighters to remain undetected during their raid on a suspected nuclear facility in 2007.¹⁴⁷\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:¹⁴⁸\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n¹⁴⁷ See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n¹⁴⁸ US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals. The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'. However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author. Although there are no official\n Stuxnet exploits four different vulnerabilities, a previously unheard of level of complexity in malware.

Ibid.\n 'Iran Says Cyber Foes Caused Centrifuge Problems', Reuters, 29 November 2010; 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage', BBC News, 29 November 2010. Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces. Christopher Williams, 'Israeli Security Chief Celebrates Stuxnet Cyber Attack', Telegraph (London), 16 February 2011. Others claim US\n\nreports of physical damage in the public domain, it is known that Iran decommissioned and replaced approximately one thousand IR-1 centrifuges in a short space of time, implying larger than expected levels of breakage.5 Footage from IAEA installed surveillance cameras tends to suggest that the work was carried out ‘feverishly’ in response to damage and around the same time Stuxnet is believed to have attacked the plant.6 Introduced into computers at the Iranian nuclear facilities via an infected USB device into a gateway target, the worm is designed to seek out its final target and cause damage by making quick changes in the rotational speed of motors and sabotaging the normal operation of control systems.7 By adjusting these speeds the virus could ultimately cause centrifuges (such as those used in nuclear enrichment facilities, the purported target of the virus) to fly apart. Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks; however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government; the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations.

Russia categorically denies any involvement and subsequent reports have found no concrete evidence to substantiate the claims. While technical data shows that some of the attacks came from IP addresses allocated to the Russian government, there is no evidence that these computers were involved in initiating the attacks, or that they had not been compromised or spoofed.\n Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 17 May 2007, Home 1.\n See generally, Chapter 3 below.\n Charles Clover, ‘Kremlin-Backed Group Behind Estonia Cyber Blitz’, *Financial Times* (London), 11 March 2009, 8, www.ft.com/techblog (last accessed 27 October 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontroversies surrounding the rule prohibiting the use of force had tended to focus on issues such as the conditions for self-defence or the existence of a right to humanitarian intervention, the advent of computer network attacks has renewed a far more fundamental question: what is the meaning of ‘force’ in the twenty-first century?\nThe prohibition of the use of force is one of the cornerstones of international law and is expressed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter:\nAll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\nHowever, the prohibition is not restricted to the Charter; the International Court of Justice has repeatedly noted that it represents not only a principle of customary international law but also a ‘fundamental or cardinal principle of such law’. The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens. However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.\n## 1. Force defined as armed force\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference. Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force. As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again. Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.\n## The Charter wording\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’. Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’. Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations. Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law. Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected. Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention. The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’. Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33]\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n[33] 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n[34] James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011). It should also be noted that these discussions took place prior to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n[35] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAn examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms. The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League, and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression. The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’. However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war. Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties. He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.\n## Subsequent iterations of the rule\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code, a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations. Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 8.\n Art. 2 states that the parties ‘will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them’; North Atlantic Treaty, 4 April 1949, 34 UNTS 243 (entered into force 24 August 1949).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nforce is used as an unqualified term and no guidance is given as to its meaning. However, when discussing such measures for the purposes of its own obligations, Articles 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter avoid using the term force without qualification by using ‘armed force’ and ‘coercive measures of an economic or political character’ as separate terms. Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS. It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable; if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations). The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited. However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n Richard W. Aldrich, ‘How Do You Know You Are at War in the Information Age?’ (2000) 22 Hous. J. Int’l L. 223, 254. Nicaragua attempted unsuccessfully to rely on this broad language in its case against the United States; however, the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to consider either the UN Charter wording or articles of the OAS Charter.\n Tom Farer, ‘Political and Economic Aggression in Contemporary International Law’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 121–32, 121.

A/AC.125/SR.114 (1970) cited in Harris, Cases and Materials, 863.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nArab oil boycott of 1973 and 1974, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible; they might well constitute illegal intervention’. The Declaration deals separately with political and economic coercion under the heading of the ‘Principle not to Intervene’, thus indicating that as far as the Declaration is concerned, force is restricted to armed coercion, and that forms of political and economic coercion were to be considered intervention.\nThe International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case held that the Declaration was indicative of the opinio juris of the international community, and showed the customary nature of the prohibition as stated in Article 2(4) of the Charter. Although the judgment does not directly address the question of the status of economic or political coercion under the use of force doctrine, the Court does not include such measures in citing the acts which may be considered ‘less grave’ forms of the use of force. The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups. This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States. This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc. A/AC125/SR25 (1966), cited ibid., 863–4.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 188.\n Ibid., para. 192.\n It should be noted, however, that Nicaragua did not attempt to argue that the economic coercion involved was sufficient to count as the threat or use of force. Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case, claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania. The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’. Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.\n Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nChina has often topped the lists of states engaged in or developing computer network attack capabilities. China has been accused of hacking attacks against government computers in the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in such attacks and, despite the problems of attribution, thus far it appears that the victim states have not considered the access and theft of information a use of force and are content to deal with them as cases of espionage. China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet. Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.

Latest statements have confirmed a commitment to collaborate internationally on cyber security issues, as well as developed cyber strategies; however, like other governments, the Chinese government has not publicly stated what computer network attacks it would consider a use of force or armed attack.\nThe United States has formally stated that it is their policy to respond to cyber attacks by any means appropriate, including military action. In July 2002, President George W. Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks. The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.\n ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation. While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.\n Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors. Because of their clandestine nature, computer network attacks are perfect fodder for rumours and misinformation; for example, Chinese hackers have been inaccurately blamed for causing a massive blackout in the north-eastern United States in 2003.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one. The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property. Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury. The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’. However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm. Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.  Ibid.\n See also Todd A. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position: Viewing Information Warfare as a Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’ (1998) 30 Case W. Res. J. Int’l L. 567, 590.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’. In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

However state practice shows that the majority of the international community is not ready for this to be the case. The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force. He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify, it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n Ibid.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale. McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority. He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order. That is, the critical\n Ibid., 917.\n Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n Ibid., 153.\n These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order. However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity. The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n Ibid.  Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy. He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force. He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.\n Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136]\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China. Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident. DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict. There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state, so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law. The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property. Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method. Alternatively, the main\n See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

    "## 1. Force defined as armed force": "Although the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n¹⁶ Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n¹⁷ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference.²⁰ Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force.²¹ As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again.²² Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.²³",
    "## The Charter wording": "The text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n²⁰ Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n²¹ See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n²² For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n²³ Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’.²⁴ Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’.²⁵ Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations.²⁶ Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n²⁴ Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n²⁵ The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n²⁶ Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law.²⁷ Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.",
    "## Travaux préparatoires and historical background": "The preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected.²⁸ Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention.²⁹ The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’.³⁰ Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.³¹\n²⁷ Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n²⁸ ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n²⁹ D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force), one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways. Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'. This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342.

In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n³⁸ Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n³⁹ W.

    "## Subsequent iterations of the rule": "As can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code,⁴⁴ a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.⁴⁵ Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.⁴⁶\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.⁴⁷\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n⁴¹ Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n⁴² Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n⁴³ Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n⁴⁴ Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n⁴⁵ The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations. Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁴⁶ Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 8.\n⁴⁷ Art. 2 states that the parties ‘will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them’; North Atlantic Treaty, 4 April 1949, 34 UNTS 243 (entered into force 24 August 1949).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nforce is used as an unqualified term and no guidance is given as to its meaning.⁴⁸ However, when discussing such measures for the purposes of its own obligations, Articles 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter avoid using the term force without qualification by using ‘armed force’ and ‘coercive measures of an economic or political character’ as separate terms. Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS.⁴⁹ It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable;⁵⁰ if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.⁵¹\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations).⁵² The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited.⁵³ However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n⁴⁸ Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n⁵⁰ Richard W. Aldrich, ‘How Do You Know You Are at War in the Information Age?’ (2000) 22 Hous. J. Int’l L. 223, 254.

The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups.⁵⁶ This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States.⁵⁷ This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.⁵⁸\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n⁵⁴ UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc.

Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n⁵⁸ It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n49\nthe Non-Use of Force.⁵⁹ As with previous General Assembly resolutions, the Declaration separates the concepts of armed intervention and economic and political coercion; however, it leaves the main controversies between developed and developing states unsettled.⁶⁰",
    "## 2. Definition of armed force": "The international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case,⁶¹ claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania.⁶² The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’.⁶³ Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.⁶⁴\n⁵⁹ Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'. In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state. However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law. In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'. The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them. In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n65 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 209.\n66 Ibid., para. 193.\n67 Ibid., para. 228.\n68 Ibid., para. 191. Much criticism has been directed at the Nicaragua (Merits) decision based on this elucidation of various levels of force, particularly from American authors. See, for example, the panel discussion reported at American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision' (1987) 81 ASIL Proc. 258.\n69 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 191.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n51\nself-determination of that right to self-determination and freedom and independence.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n70 Again the Court's approach in using the Declaration has been controversial. Some authors argue that the Court has used the Declaration as a source of law, a position which the states parties to the resolution would never have intended. Authors have also criticised the Court for using the text of the Declaration as indicative of opinio juris of the international community without also fully examining the actions of states: see generally, American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision'. But cf. Lori Fisler Damrosch, 'Politics across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence over Domestic Affairs' (1989) 83 AJIL 1, 8.\n71 This is in accord with the drafting history of Article 3g of the Definition of Aggression which rejected a proposal to include several of the broad range of activities listed as indirect aggression in the Declaration on Friendly Relations. See Pierluigi L. Zanardi, 'Indirect Military Aggression' in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation on the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 111-19, 116.\n72 The indirectness of computer network attacks is addressed in section 3.1.1 below.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n73 Damrosch, ‘Politics across Borders’, 10.\n74 Case Concerning the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran) (1980) 74 AJIL 746, International Court of Justice, para. 59. In that case the Ayatollah had made several public declarations inveighing against the United States and holding the US responsible for the trouble besetting that country. On 1 November the Ayatollah had made a statement declaring it was ‘up to the dear pupils, students and theological students to expand with all their might their attacks against the United States and Israel, so that they may force the United States to return the deposed and Criminal Shah, and to condemn this great plot’. Further, congratulatory statements from the Ayatollah following the attack and other statements of official approval were also made.\n75 Presumably because of the lack of imputability to a state party.\n76 Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 7.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n53\nforce in Article 2(4). In setting out the area covered by the prohibition against force, the Court stated that Article 2(4) of the Charter represented only part of the customary international law relating to the use of force and stated that the UN Charter 'by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of the use of force in international relations'. The Court pointed out that the right to self-defence stood alongside the Charter and that the Charter text did not go on to regulate all of the aspects of that rule. Bearing that in mind, we need now to turn to state practice and the theories of force propounded by other academics.",
    "## 2.1. State actions": "Given the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.

As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n79 For example, the US called the attacks 'unacceptable' and 'pressure on an independent country' but stopped short of calling the attacks force: 'Rice Condemns Ongoing Cyber-Attacks as Estonian Embassy Siege Ends', earthtimes.org 4 May 2007.\n80 AFP, 'Cyber Attacks on Estonia Are Security Issue: NATO Chief', The Age (Melbourne), 26 May 2007.\n81 'The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia', BBC News, 17 May 2007.

China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet.⁸⁷ Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.⁸⁸ In September 2002 China announced that it had developed five new information warfare\n⁸⁴ Ibid.\n⁸⁵ See, for example, McAfee, *Virtual Criminology Report*, McAfee Inc.

Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks.⁹² The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’⁹³ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.⁹⁴\n⁸⁹ ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n⁹⁰ Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n⁹¹ Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n⁹² Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n⁹³ Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁴ Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Statements by NATO officials have been careful to frame NATO's cyber defence actions within Article 4 relating to consultation in response to threats to territorial integrity, political independence or national security rather than Article 5 collective self-defence.⁹⁵\nInternational reaction to the Stuxnet worm has also been decidedly muted, although this attack is perhaps the clearest example to date of a computer network attack amounting to a use of force (if not an armed attack). Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation.⁹⁶ While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.⁹⁷\n⁹⁵ Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁶ 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n⁹⁷ As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors.

    "## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings": "Although they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one.⁹⁸ The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property.⁹⁹ Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury.¹⁰⁰ The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter.¹⁰¹ In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’.¹⁰² However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm.¹⁰³ Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n⁹⁸ For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n⁹⁹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n¹⁰⁰ Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n¹⁰¹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362. ¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ See also Todd A.

Used in this manner, the term war is merely used to signify resolve,¹⁰⁴ a point that has been noted by legal commentators and politicians alike.¹⁰⁵ Thus the semantics of war and weaponry are no longer useful criteria in determining whether something is a use of force.¹⁰⁶ Further, as was seen in the 2001 anthrax scares in the United States and the release of sarin gas on a Tokyo subway train in 1995, the requirement of a weapons-based delivery system is not essential for a chemical or biological attack. The International Court of Justice has also noted in its advisory opinion on Nuclear Weapons that the provisions relating to the use of force in the Charter do not refer to specific weapons but rather apply to the use of force regardless of the weapons employed.¹⁰⁷\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’.¹⁰⁸ In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n¹⁰⁴ Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.¹¹⁰\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force.¹¹¹ He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:¹¹²\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify,¹¹³ it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n¹⁰⁹ Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n¹¹⁰ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n¹¹¹ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n¹¹² Ibid.\n¹¹³ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n61\nadoption by the international community.¹¹⁴ However, it is also equally clear that the requirement and current analysis with regard to weaponry cannot stand as it is and must be revisited if it is to take into account changes in technology.\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale.¹¹⁵ McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.¹¹⁶\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority.¹¹⁷ He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order.¹¹⁸ That is, the critical\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 917.\n¹¹⁵ Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 153.\n¹¹⁷ These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n¹¹⁸ Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n62 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order.¹¹⁹ However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity.¹²⁰ The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.",
    "## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force": "As noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n¹¹⁹ Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n¹²⁰ Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n63\n'armed force' leads towards an erosion of the exclusion of economic and political coercion. Michael Schmitt has suggested that the use of force proscription is based on the desire of the international community to foster and advance the aspirational values set out in the preamble to the Charter. The prohibition on 'armed' force is thus a kind of instrumental shorthand way to restrict those acts that are most likely to endanger those objectives and aims. Schmitt argues that the international community is not concerned so much with the instrumentality of the coercion but rather the consequences of its use.¹²¹ However, given that the range of possible consequences of any given kind of attack (i.e. denial of service, virus, direct intrusions etc.) range along a continuum, assessing the consequences of an attack can be a Sisyphean task, making the criteria for placement upon that continuum extremely difficult.\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.¹²²\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:¹²³\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n¹²¹ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n¹²² Ibid. ¹²³ Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n64 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy.¹²⁴ He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n¹²⁴ Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n65\nlaw on the use of force and the law applicable in armed conflict, it was essential to take account of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons.¹²⁵ The same approach may be adopted in respect of computer network attacks.",
    "## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks": "The problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.¹²⁶\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.",
    "## 3.1.1. Indirectness": "Although direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n¹²⁵ Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n¹²⁶ Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning.

These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force. Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems. This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n67\nthe attacks against Estonia in 2007; although computers inside the Kremlin were used in the attacks, subsequent analysis of the attacks concluded that those computers could well have been compromised by the groups of patriotic hackers generally believed to be responsible for the attacks.¹³⁰ Thus the indirectness of the attack obfuscates the true perpetrator of the attack, and increases the risk that countermeasures may be directed at innocent parties. While this may be viewed as a desirable effect by an attacking state in that it permits a high level of plausible deniability, such opacity makes the task of determining the correct legal standard to apply while the attack is ongoing that much harder.",
    "## 3.1.2. Intangibility": "The second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.",
    "## Target intangibility": "Computer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n¹³⁰ See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).",
    "## Weapons intangibility": "A second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n69\nThat is, a weapon is anything that directly causes physical damage and human injury. Jacobson has argued that ‘armed’ simply means equipped with weapons of war, and that weapons are tools designed to accomplish a specific mission.¹³² Brownlie’s approach was to fit the new technology to the definition. Given that a purely results-based approach does not provide the appropriate distinction between armed and other forms of coercion without reference to some other factors, those who adopt an instrument-based analysis argue the means of producing the results are still significant. That is, if a computer network attack does not meet some form of weapons criterion then it is likely that the use of such attack techniques will fall within the levels of coercion currently occupied by political and economic coercion. Where these attacks take place during an armed conflict, such acts will be seen as part of the ongoing conflict, and will be judged accordingly;¹³³ however, it is worth emphasising that, in this instance, these issues are raised in relation to the exercise of such force by an actor of the state before the commencement of traditional military action.\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force.¹³⁴ He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.¹³⁵\n¹³² Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n¹³³ For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n¹³⁴ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.",
    "## 3.1.3. Locus": "Another argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack. However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n71\nby the host state.¹³⁸ Further, the actions of the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel case were held to be a policy of force even though the strait concerned was of the ‘class of international highways through which passage cannot be prohibited’.¹³⁹\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China.¹⁴⁰ Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident.¹⁴¹ DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n¹³⁸ See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n¹³⁹ Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n¹⁴⁰ See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n¹⁴¹ Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict.¹⁴² There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state,¹⁴³ so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law.¹⁴⁴ The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.",
    "## 3.1.4. Result": "Computer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, the main\n¹⁴² See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n¹⁴³ For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n¹⁴⁴ See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n¹⁴⁵ For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n¹⁴⁶ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n73\npurpose of the computer network attack may be the denial, corruption or exploitation of the information target itself. For example, the Israeli attacks against the Syrian air defence radar system which allowed their fighters to remain undetected during their raid on a suspected nuclear facility in 2007.¹⁴⁷\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:¹⁴⁸\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n¹⁴⁷ See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n¹⁴⁸ US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.",
    "## 4. Conclusion": "The present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals. The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'. However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author. Although there are no official\n Stuxnet exploits four different vulnerabilities, a previously unheard of level of complexity in malware. Nicolas Falliere, Liam OMurchu and Eric Chien, W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Symantec (2011) version 1.4, www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf (last accessed 12 February 2011).\n Approximately 60 per cent of all infected PCs are located in Iran. Ibid.\n 'Iran Says Cyber Foes Caused Centrifuge Problems', Reuters, 29 November 2010; 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage', BBC News, 29 November 2010. Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces. Christopher Williams, 'Israeli Security Chief Celebrates Stuxnet Cyber Attack', Telegraph (London), 16 February 2011. Others claim US\n\nreports of physical damage in the public domain, it is known that Iran decommissioned and replaced approximately one thousand IR-1 centrifuges in a short space of time, implying larger than expected levels of breakage.5 Footage from IAEA installed surveillance cameras tends to suggest that the work was carried out ‘feverishly’ in response to damage and around the same time Stuxnet is believed to have attacked the plant.6 Introduced into computers at the Iranian nuclear facilities via an infected USB device into a gateway target, the worm is designed to seek out its final target and cause damage by making quick changes in the rotational speed of motors and sabotaging the normal operation of control systems.7 By adjusting these speeds the virus could ultimately cause centrifuges (such as those used in nuclear enrichment facilities, the purported target of the virus) to fly apart. Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks; however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government; the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations. While\n Ian Traynor, ‘Web Attackers Used a Million Computers, Says Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 18 May 2007, International 30.\n Tony Halpin, ‘Putin Accused of Launching Cyber War’, *The Times* (London), 18 May 2007, Overseas News 46.\n Traynor, ‘Web Attackers Used a Million Computers, Says Estonia’. Russia categorically denies any involvement and subsequent reports have found no concrete evidence to substantiate the claims. While technical data shows that some of the attacks came from IP addresses allocated to the Russian government, there is no evidence that these computers were involved in initiating the attacks, or that they had not been compromised or spoofed.\n Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 17 May 2007, Home 1.\n See generally, Chapter 3 below.\n Charles Clover, ‘Kremlin-Backed Group Behind Estonia Cyber Blitz’, *Financial Times* (London), 11 March 2009, 8, www.ft.com/techblog (last accessed 27 October 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontroversies surrounding the rule prohibiting the use of force had tended to focus on issues such as the conditions for self-defence or the existence of a right to humanitarian intervention, the advent of computer network attacks has renewed a far more fundamental question: what is the meaning of ‘force’ in the twenty-first century?\nThe prohibition of the use of force is one of the cornerstones of international law and is expressed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter:\nAll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\nHowever, the prohibition is not restricted to the Charter; the International Court of Justice has repeatedly noted that it represents not only a principle of customary international law but also a ‘fundamental or cardinal principle of such law’. The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens. However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.\n## 1. Force defined as armed force\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference. Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force. As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again. Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.\n## The Charter wording\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’. Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’. Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations. Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law. Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected. Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention. The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’. Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33]\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n[33] 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n[34] James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011). It should also be noted that these discussions took place prior to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n[35] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAn examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms. The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League, and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression. The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’. However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war. Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties. He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.\n## Subsequent iterations of the rule\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code, a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations. Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 8.\n Art. 2 states that the parties ‘will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them’; North Atlantic Treaty, 4 April 1949, 34 UNTS 243 (entered into force 24 August 1949).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nforce is used as an unqualified term and no guidance is given as to its meaning. However, when discussing such measures for the purposes of its own obligations, Articles 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter avoid using the term force without qualification by using ‘armed force’ and ‘coercive measures of an economic or political character’ as separate terms. Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS. It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable; if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations). The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited. However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n Richard W. Aldrich, ‘How Do You Know You Are at War in the Information Age?’ (2000) 22 Hous. J. Int’l L. 223, 254. Nicaragua attempted unsuccessfully to rely on this broad language in its case against the United States; however, the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to consider either the UN Charter wording or articles of the OAS Charter.\n Tom Farer, ‘Political and Economic Aggression in Contemporary International Law’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 121–32, 121.

A/AC.125/SR.114 (1970) cited in Harris, Cases and Materials, 863.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nArab oil boycott of 1973 and 1974, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible; they might well constitute illegal intervention’. The Declaration deals separately with political and economic coercion under the heading of the ‘Principle not to Intervene’, thus indicating that as far as the Declaration is concerned, force is restricted to armed coercion, and that forms of political and economic coercion were to be considered intervention.\nThe International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case held that the Declaration was indicative of the opinio juris of the international community, and showed the customary nature of the prohibition as stated in Article 2(4) of the Charter. Although the judgment does not directly address the question of the status of economic or political coercion under the use of force doctrine, the Court does not include such measures in citing the acts which may be considered ‘less grave’ forms of the use of force. The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups. This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States. This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc. A/AC125/SR25 (1966), cited ibid., 863–4.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 188.\n Ibid., para. 192.\n It should be noted, however, that Nicaragua did not attempt to argue that the economic coercion involved was sufficient to count as the threat or use of force. Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case, claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania. The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’. Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.\n Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia.

China has been accused of hacking attacks against government computers in the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in such attacks and, despite the problems of attribution, thus far it appears that the victim states have not considered the access and theft of information a use of force and are content to deal with them as cases of espionage. China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet. Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.

Latest statements have confirmed a commitment to collaborate internationally on cyber security issues, as well as developed cyber strategies; however, like other governments, the Chinese government has not publicly stated what computer network attacks it would consider a use of force or armed attack.\nThe United States has formally stated that it is their policy to respond to cyber attacks by any means appropriate, including military action. In July 2002, President George W. Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks. The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.\n ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation. While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.\n Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors. Because of their clandestine nature, computer network attacks are perfect fodder for rumours and misinformation; for example, Chinese hackers have been inaccurately blamed for causing a massive blackout in the north-eastern United States in 2003.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one. The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property. Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury. The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’. However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm. Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.  Ibid.\n See also Todd A. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position: Viewing Information Warfare as a Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’ (1998) 30 Case W. Res. J. Int’l L. 567, 590.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’. In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

However state practice shows that the majority of the international community is not ready for this to be the case. The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force. He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify, it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n Ibid.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale. McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority. He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order. That is, the critical\n Ibid., 917.\n Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n Ibid., 153.\n These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order. However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity. The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n Ibid.  Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy. He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force. He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.\n Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136]\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China. Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident. DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict. There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state, so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law. The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property. Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method. Alternatively, the main\n See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals. The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'. However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author.

Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces.

Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks; however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government; the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations.

The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens. However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.\n## 1. Force defined as armed force\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference. Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force. As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again. Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.\n## The Charter wording\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’. Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’. Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations. Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law. Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected. Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention. The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’. Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33]\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n[33] 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n[34] James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011). It should also be noted that these discussions took place prior to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n[35] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAn examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms. The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League, and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression. The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’. However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war. Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties. He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.\n## Subsequent iterations of the rule\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code, a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations. Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 8.\n Art. 2 states that the parties ‘will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them’; North Atlantic Treaty, 4 April 1949, 34 UNTS 243 (entered into force 24 August 1949).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nforce is used as an unqualified term and no guidance is given as to its meaning. However, when discussing such measures for the purposes of its own obligations, Articles 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter avoid using the term force without qualification by using ‘armed force’ and ‘coercive measures of an economic or political character’ as separate terms. Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS. It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable; if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations). The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited. However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n Richard W. Aldrich, ‘How Do You Know You Are at War in the Information Age?’ (2000) 22 Hous. J. Int’l L. 223, 254. Nicaragua attempted unsuccessfully to rely on this broad language in its case against the United States; however, the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to consider either the UN Charter wording or articles of the OAS Charter.\n Tom Farer, ‘Political and Economic Aggression in Contemporary International Law’ in A.

The Declaration deals separately with political and economic coercion under the heading of the ‘Principle not to Intervene’, thus indicating that as far as the Declaration is concerned, force is restricted to armed coercion, and that forms of political and economic coercion were to be considered intervention.\nThe International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case held that the Declaration was indicative of the opinio juris of the international community, and showed the customary nature of the prohibition as stated in Article 2(4) of the Charter. Although the judgment does not directly address the question of the status of economic or political coercion under the use of force doctrine, the Court does not include such measures in citing the acts which may be considered ‘less grave’ forms of the use of force. The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups. This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States. This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc. A/AC125/SR25 (1966), cited ibid., 863–4.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 188.\n Ibid., para. 192.\n It should be noted, however, that Nicaragua did not attempt to argue that the economic coercion involved was sufficient to count as the threat or use of force. Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case, claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania. The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’. Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.\n Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nChina has often topped the lists of states engaged in or developing computer network attack capabilities. China has been accused of hacking attacks against government computers in the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in such attacks and, despite the problems of attribution, thus far it appears that the victim states have not considered the access and theft of information a use of force and are content to deal with them as cases of espionage. China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet. Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.

Latest statements have confirmed a commitment to collaborate internationally on cyber security issues, as well as developed cyber strategies; however, like other governments, the Chinese government has not publicly stated what computer network attacks it would consider a use of force or armed attack.\nThe United States has formally stated that it is their policy to respond to cyber attacks by any means appropriate, including military action. In July 2002, President George W. Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks. The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.\n ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation. While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.\n Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors. Because of their clandestine nature, computer network attacks are perfect fodder for rumours and misinformation; for example, Chinese hackers have been inaccurately blamed for causing a massive blackout in the north-eastern United States in 2003.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one. The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property. Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury. The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’. However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm. Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.  Ibid.\n See also Todd A. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position: Viewing Information Warfare as a Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’ (1998) 30 Case W. Res. J. Int’l L. 567, 590.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’. In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

However state practice shows that the majority of the international community is not ready for this to be the case. The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force. He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify, it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n Ibid.\n Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale. McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority. He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order. That is, the critical\n Ibid., 917.\n Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n Ibid., 153.\n These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order. However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity. The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n Ibid.  Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy. He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force. He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.\n Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136]\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China. Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident. DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict. There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state, so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law. The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property. Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method. Alternatively, the main\n See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

Others claim US\n37\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nreports of physical damage in the public domain, it is known that Iran decommissioned and replaced approximately one thousand IR-1 centrifuges in a short space of time, implying larger than expected levels of breakage.5 Footage from IAEA installed surveillance cameras tends to suggest that the work was carried out ‘feverishly’ in response to damage and around the same time Stuxnet is believed to have attacked the plant.6 Introduced into computers at the Iranian nuclear facilities via an infected USB device into a gateway target, the worm is designed to seek out its final target and cause damage by making quick changes in the rotational speed of motors and sabotaging the normal operation of control systems.7 By adjusting these speeds the virus could ultimately cause centrifuges (such as those used in nuclear enrichment facilities, the purported target of the virus) to fly apart. Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n5 Albright, Brannan and Walrond, ISIS Stuxnet Report; Kim Zetter, ‘Report Strengthens Suspicion That Stuxnet Sabotaged Iran’s Nuclear Plant’, Wired 27 December 2010, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/isis-report-on-stuxnet/# (last accessed 13 February 2011).\n6 Zetter, ‘Surveillance Footage and Code Clues Indicate Stuxnet Hit Iran’.\n7 William J. Broad and David E. Sanger, ‘Worm Was Perfect for Sabotaging Centrifuges’, New York Times (New York), 18 November 2010, A1. The worm targets frequency converters, a type of power supply that changes its output frequency to control the speed of a motor.\n8 See Chapter 1 above, and Appendix 1 for a description of this event.\n9 A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) uses many compromised computers to flood a target system with requests for information until it collapses under the strain. The compromised computers are usually ones that have been recruited to a botnet (usually without their owner’s knowledge) and are controlled by a master computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n39\nstate like Estonia that depends on the internet for everything from parking to banking to voting, the attacks caused serious disruption and caused an estimated tens of millions of euros' worth of damage.¹⁰ Despite earlier explicit accusations that the Russian Federation was behind the offensive,¹¹ the Estonian government backed away from directly accusing the Kremlin of launching the attacks,¹² but requested assistance from its NATO allies under the terms of that alliance. Although no official statement regarding the cyber attacks was released by NATO, one of the clearest indications of the member states' views on computer network attacks came from Estonian defence minister Jaak Aaviksoo, who raised the matter with NATO:\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.¹³\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks;¹⁴ however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government;¹⁵ the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations.

Force defined as armed force\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n¹⁶ Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n¹⁷ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference.²⁰ Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force.²¹ As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again.²² Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.²³\n## The Charter wording\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n²⁰ Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n²¹ See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n²² For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n²³ Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’.²⁴ Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’.²⁵ Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations.²⁶ Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n²⁴ Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n²⁵ The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n²⁶ Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law.²⁷ Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected.²⁸ Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention.²⁹ The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’.³⁰ Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.³¹\n²⁷ Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n²⁸ ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n²⁹ D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force), one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways. Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'. This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011).

In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n³⁸ Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n³⁹ W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n⁴⁰ Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\ncontained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war.⁴¹ Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties.⁴² He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.⁴³\n## Subsequent iterations of the rule\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code,⁴⁴ a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.⁴⁵ Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.⁴⁶\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.⁴⁷\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n⁴¹ Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n⁴² Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n⁴³ Ibid. Cf. D. W. Bowett, Self-Defence in International Law (University of Manchester Press, 1958), 136.\n⁴⁴ Christine D. Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n⁴⁵ The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations.

Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS.⁴⁹ It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable;⁵⁰ if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.⁵¹\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations).⁵² The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited.⁵³ However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n⁴⁸ Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n⁵⁰ Richard W.

The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups.⁵⁶ This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States.⁵⁷ This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.⁵⁸\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n⁵⁴ UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc.

Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n⁵⁸ It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n49\nthe Non-Use of Force.⁵⁹ As with previous General Assembly resolutions, the Declaration separates the concepts of armed intervention and economic and political coercion; however, it leaves the main controversies between developed and developing states unsettled.⁶⁰\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case,⁶¹ claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania.⁶² The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’.⁶³ Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.⁶⁴\n⁵⁹ Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'. In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state. However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law. In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'. The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them. In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n65 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 209.\n66 Ibid., para. 193.\n67 Ibid., para. 228.\n68 Ibid., para. 191. Much criticism has been directed at the Nicaragua (Merits) decision based on this elucidation of various levels of force, particularly from American authors. See, for example, the panel discussion reported at American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision' (1987) 81 ASIL Proc. 258.\n69 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 191.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n51\nself-determination of that right to self-determination and freedom and independence.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72\nSecondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n70 Again the Court's approach in using the Declaration has been controversial. Some authors argue that the Court has used the Declaration as a source of law, a position which the states parties to the resolution would never have intended. Authors have also criticised the Court for using the text of the Declaration as indicative of opinio juris of the international community without also fully examining the actions of states: see generally, American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision'. But cf. Lori Fisler Damrosch, 'Politics across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence over Domestic Affairs' (1989) 83 AJIL 1, 8.\n71 This is in accord with the drafting history of Article 3g of the Definition of Aggression which rejected a proposal to include several of the broad range of activities listed as indirect aggression in the Declaration on Friendly Relations. See Pierluigi L. Zanardi, 'Indirect Military Aggression' in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation on the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 111-19, 116.\n72 The indirectness of computer network attacks is addressed in section 3.1.1 below.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n73 Damrosch, ‘Politics across Borders’, 10.\n74 Case Concerning the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran) (1980) 74 AJIL 746, International Court of Justice, para. 59. In that case the Ayatollah had made several public declarations inveighing against the United States and holding the US responsible for the trouble besetting that country. On 1 November the Ayatollah had made a statement declaring it was ‘up to the dear pupils, students and theological students to expand with all their might their attacks against the United States and Israel, so that they may force the United States to return the deposed and Criminal Shah, and to condemn this great plot’. Further, congratulatory statements from the Ayatollah following the attack and other statements of official approval were also made.\n75 Presumably because of the lack of imputability to a state party.\n76 Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 7.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n53\nforce in Article 2(4). In setting out the area covered by the prohibition against force, the Court stated that Article 2(4) of the Charter represented only part of the customary international law relating to the use of force and stated that the UN Charter 'by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of the use of force in international relations'. The Court pointed out that the right to self-defence stood alongside the Charter and that the Charter text did not go on to regulate all of the aspects of that rule. Bearing that in mind, we need now to turn to state practice and the theories of force propounded by other academics.\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure. For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n79 For example, the US called the attacks 'unacceptable' and 'pressure on an independent country' but stopped short of calling the attacks force: 'Rice Condemns Ongoing Cyber-Attacks as Estonian Embassy Siege Ends', earthtimes.org 4 May 2007.\n80 AFP, 'Cyber Attacks on Estonia Are Security Issue: NATO Chief', The Age (Melbourne), 26 May 2007.\n81 'The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia', BBC News, 17 May 2007. As noted previously, responsibility for the attacks has been claimed by a member of the Russian 'Nashi' youth group, stating that the attacks were carried out without state involvement. The attribution has not been confirmed.\n82 V. I.

China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet.⁸⁷ Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.⁸⁸ In September 2002 China announced that it had developed five new information warfare\n⁸⁴ Ibid.\n⁸⁵ See, for example, McAfee, *Virtual Criminology Report*, McAfee Inc.

Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks.⁹² The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks ... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’⁹³ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.⁹⁴\n⁸⁹ ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n⁹⁰ Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n⁹¹ Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n⁹² Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n⁹³ Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁴ Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Statements by NATO officials have been careful to frame NATO's cyber defence actions within Article 4 relating to consultation in response to threats to territorial integrity, political independence or national security rather than Article 5 collective self-defence.⁹⁵\nInternational reaction to the Stuxnet worm has also been decidedly muted, although this attack is perhaps the clearest example to date of a computer network attack amounting to a use of force (if not an armed attack). Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation.⁹⁶ While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.⁹⁷\n⁹⁵ Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁶ 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n⁹⁷ As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors. Because of their clandestine nature, computer network attacks are perfect fodder for rumours and misinformation; for example, Chinese hackers have been inaccurately blamed for causing a massive blackout in the north-eastern United States in 2003.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one.⁹⁸ The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property.⁹⁹ Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury.¹⁰⁰ The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter.¹⁰¹ In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’.¹⁰² However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm.¹⁰³ Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror,\n⁹⁸ For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n⁹⁹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n¹⁰⁰ Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n¹⁰¹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362. ¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ See also Todd A.

Used in this manner, the term war is merely used to signify resolve,¹⁰⁴ a point that has been noted by legal commentators and politicians alike.¹⁰⁵ Thus the semantics of war and weaponry are no longer useful criteria in determining whether something is a use of force.¹⁰⁶ Further, as was seen in the 2001 anthrax scares in the United States and the release of sarin gas on a Tokyo subway train in 1995, the requirement of a weapons-based delivery system is not essential for a chemical or biological attack. The International Court of Justice has also noted in its advisory opinion on Nuclear Weapons that the provisions relating to the use of force in the Charter do not refer to specific weapons but rather apply to the use of force regardless of the weapons employed.¹⁰⁷\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’.¹⁰⁸ In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n¹⁰⁴ Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.¹¹⁰\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force.¹¹¹ He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:¹¹²\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify,¹¹³ it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n¹⁰⁹ Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n¹¹⁰ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n¹¹¹ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n¹¹² Ibid.\n¹¹³ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nDEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n61\nadoption by the international community.¹¹⁴ However, it is also equally clear that the requirement and current analysis with regard to weaponry cannot stand as it is and must be revisited if it is to take into account changes in technology.\nThe second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale.¹¹⁵ McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.¹¹⁶\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority.¹¹⁷ He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order.¹¹⁸ That is, the critical\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 917.\n¹¹⁵ Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 153.\n¹¹⁷ These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n¹¹⁸ Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n62 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nquestion is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order.¹¹⁹ However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity.¹²⁰ The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n¹¹⁹ Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n¹²⁰ Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n63\n'armed force' leads towards an erosion of the exclusion of economic and political coercion. Michael Schmitt has suggested that the use of force proscription is based on the desire of the international community to foster and advance the aspirational values set out in the preamble to the Charter. The prohibition on 'armed' force is thus a kind of instrumental shorthand way to restrict those acts that are most likely to endanger those objectives and aims. Schmitt argues that the international community is not concerned so much with the instrumentality of the coercion but rather the consequences of its use.¹²¹ However, given that the range of possible consequences of any given kind of attack (i.e. denial of service, virus, direct intrusions etc.) range along a continuum, assessing the consequences of an attack can be a Sisyphean task, making the criteria for placement upon that continuum extremely difficult.\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.¹²²\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:¹²³\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n¹²¹ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n¹²² Ibid. ¹²³ Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n64 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy.¹²⁴ He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n¹²⁴ Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n65\nlaw on the use of force and the law applicable in armed conflict, it was essential to take account of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons.¹²⁵ The same approach may be adopted in respect of computer network attacks.\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.¹²⁶\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n¹²⁵ Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n¹²⁶ Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force. Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems. This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n67\nthe attacks against Estonia in 2007; although computers inside the Kremlin were used in the attacks, subsequent analysis of the attacks concluded that those computers could well have been compromised by the groups of patriotic hackers generally believed to be responsible for the attacks.¹³⁰ Thus the indirectness of the attack obfuscates the true perpetrator of the attack, and increases the risk that countermeasures may be directed at innocent parties. While this may be viewed as a desirable effect by an attacking state in that it permits a high level of plausible deniability, such opacity makes the task of determining the correct legal standard to apply while the attack is ongoing that much harder.\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n¹³⁰ See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n69\nThat is, a weapon is anything that directly causes physical damage and human injury. Jacobson has argued that ‘armed’ simply means equipped with weapons of war, and that weapons are tools designed to accomplish a specific mission.¹³² Brownlie’s approach was to fit the new technology to the definition. Given that a purely results-based approach does not provide the appropriate distinction between armed and other forms of coercion without reference to some other factors, those who adopt an instrument-based analysis argue the means of producing the results are still significant. That is, if a computer network attack does not meet some form of weapons criterion then it is likely that the use of such attack techniques will fall within the levels of coercion currently occupied by political and economic coercion. Where these attacks take place during an armed conflict, such acts will be seen as part of the ongoing conflict, and will be judged accordingly;¹³³ however, it is worth emphasising that, in this instance, these issues are raised in relation to the exercise of such force by an actor of the state before the commencement of traditional military action.\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force.¹³⁴ He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.¹³⁵\n¹³² Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n¹³³ For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n¹³⁴ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack. However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n71\nby the host state.¹³⁸ Further, the actions of the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel case were held to be a policy of force even though the strait concerned was of the ‘class of international highways through which passage cannot be prohibited’.¹³⁹\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China.¹⁴⁰ Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident.¹⁴¹ DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n¹³⁸ See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n¹³⁹ Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n¹⁴⁰ See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n¹⁴¹ Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nconflict.¹⁴² There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state,¹⁴³ so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law.¹⁴⁴ The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, the main\n¹⁴² See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n¹⁴³ For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n¹⁴⁴ See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n¹⁴⁵ For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n¹⁴⁶ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n73\npurpose of the computer network attack may be the denial, corruption or exploitation of the information target itself. For example, the Israeli attacks against the Syrian air defence radar system which allowed their fighters to remain undetected during their raid on a suspected nuclear facility in 2007.¹⁴⁷\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:¹⁴⁸\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n¹⁴⁷ See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n¹⁴⁸ US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals.¹ The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation.² Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'.³ However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author.⁴ Although there are no official ¹ Stuxnet exploits four different vulnerabilities, a previously unheard of level of complexity in malware. Nicolas Falliere, Liam OMurchu and Eric Chien, W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Symantec (2011) version 1.4, www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf (last accessed 12 February 2011).\n² Approximately 60 per cent of all infected PCs are located in Iran. Ibid.\n³ 'Iran Says Cyber Foes Caused Centrifuge Problems', Reuters, 29 November 2010; 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage', BBC News, 29 November 2010. Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n⁴ In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces. Christopher Williams, 'Israeli Security Chief Celebrates Stuxnet Cyber Attack', Telegraph (London), 16 February 2011. Others claim US reports of physical damage in the public domain, it is known that Iran decommissioned and replaced approximately one thousand IR-1 centrifuges in a short space of time, implying larger than expected levels of breakage.5 Footage from IAEA installed surveillance cameras tends to suggest that the work was carried out ‘feverishly’ in response to damage and around the same time Stuxnet is believed to have attacked the plant.6 Introduced into computers at the Iranian nuclear facilities via an infected USB device into a gateway target, the worm is designed to seek out its final target and cause damage by making quick changes in the rotational speed of motors and sabotaging the normal operation of control systems.7 By adjusting these speeds the virus could ultimately cause centrifuges (such as those used in nuclear enrichment facilities, the purported target of the virus) to fly apart. Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent involvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated. See, for example, Kim Zetter, ‘Did a U.S. Government Lab Help Israel Develop Stuxnet?’, Wired 17 January 2011, www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/inl-and-stuxnet/ (last accessed 10 April 2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.¹³ This attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks;¹⁴ however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government;¹⁵ the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations. While ¹⁰ Ian Traynor, ‘Web Attackers Used a Million Computers, Says Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 18 May 2007, International 30.\n¹¹ Tony Halpin, ‘Putin Accused of Launching Cyber War’, *The Times* (London), 18 May 2007, Overseas News 46.\n¹² Traynor, ‘Web Attackers Used a Million Computers, Says Estonia’. Russia categorically denies any involvement and subsequent reports have found no concrete evidence to substantiate the claims. While technical data shows that some of the attacks came from IP addresses allocated to the Russian government, there is no evidence that these computers were involved in initiating the attacks, or that they had not been compromised or spoofed.\n¹³ Ian Traynor, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, *Guardian* (London), 17 May 2007, Home 1.\n¹⁴ See generally, Chapter 3 below.\n¹⁵ Charles Clover, ‘Kremlin-Backed Group Behind Estonia Cyber Blitz’, *Financial Times* (London), 11 March 2009, 8, www.ft.com/techblog (last accessed 27 October 2010).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE controversies surrounding the rule prohibiting the use of force had tended to focus on issues such as the conditions for self-defence or the existence of a right to humanitarian intervention,¹⁶ the advent of computer network attacks has renewed a far more fundamental question: what is the meaning of ‘force’ in the twenty-first century?\nThe prohibition of the use of force is one of the cornerstones of international law and is expressed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\nHowever, the prohibition is not restricted to the Charter; the International Court of Justice has repeatedly noted that it represents not only a principle of customary international law but also a ‘fundamental or cardinal principle of such law’.¹⁷ The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens.¹⁸ However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.¹⁹ ## 1. Force defined as armed force Although the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so ¹⁶ Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n¹⁷ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference.²⁰ Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force.²¹ As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again.²² Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.²³ ## The Charter wording The text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states: ²⁰ Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n²¹ See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n²² For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n²³ Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’.²⁴ Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’.²⁵ Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations.²⁶ Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n²⁴ Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n²⁵ The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n²⁶ Michael N. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Col. J. Trans. L. 885, 904.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE Albrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law.²⁷ Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background The preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected.²⁸ Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention.²⁹ The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’.³⁰ Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.³¹ ²⁷ Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n²⁸ ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n²⁹ D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE While developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33] Apart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342. The New Zealand amendment reads as follows: 'All members of the Organisation undertake collectively to resist every act of aggression against any member'. The amendment was rejected by a vote of 26 in favour and 18 against, for failing to receive a two-thirds majority.\n[33] 'Addendum to Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 866, I/1/30(a), 8 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945) 356.\n[34] James Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation as One Aspect of Offensive Information Warfare: Questions of Legality under the United Nations Charter Article 2(4), Naval War College (1996), 57, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA310926 (last accessed 5 July 2011). It should also be noted that these discussions took place prior to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n[35] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE An examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹ Under the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war ³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’ ³⁸ Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’ ³⁹ W. Bishop Jr, International Law: Cases and Materials 1010 (3rd edn, 1971), cited in Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’, 274.\n⁴⁰ Art. 1, General Treaty for the Renunciation of War 1928, UKTS 29 (1929), Cmnd, 3410; 94 LNTS 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE contained in the Pact has never been whether the treaty prohibits armed force short of war as well as war.⁴¹ Professor Ian Brownlie suggests that the best guide to the meaning of the Pact is to be found in the subsequent actions of the contracting parties.⁴² He concludes that there leaves little room for doubt that it was understood to prohibit ‘any substantial use of armed force’.⁴³ ## Subsequent iterations of the rule As can be seen from the foregoing, the rules of the Charter relating to force are brief and cannot constitute a complete code,⁴⁴ a fact acknowledged by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.⁴⁵ Almost from the time that the Charter was drafted, states have tried to elaborate the prohibition on the use of force in General Assembly resolutions to provide greater clarity. However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.⁴⁶ Two other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.⁴⁷ The Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however ⁴¹ Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n⁴² Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n⁴³ Ibid.

Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2004), 6.\n⁴⁵ The Court stated that the UN Charter by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of force in international relations.

Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS.⁴⁹ It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable;⁵⁰ if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.⁵¹ The issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations).⁵² The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited.⁵³ However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the ⁴⁸ Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n⁴⁹ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n⁵⁰ Richard W. Aldrich, ‘How Do You Know You Are at War in the Information Age?’ (2000) 22 Hous. J. Int’l L. 223, 254.

The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups.⁵⁶ This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States.⁵⁷ This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.⁵⁸ Since the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on ⁵⁴ UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc. A/AC125/SR25 (1966), cited ibid., 863–4.\n⁵⁵ Nicaragua (Merits), para. 188.\n⁵⁶ Ibid., para. 192.\n⁵⁷ It should be noted, however, that Nicaragua did not attempt to argue that the economic coercion involved was sufficient to count as the threat or use of force. Although the Court stated later in the judgment that it would not rule on legal arguments not put forward by the parties (in relation to the prohibition against intervention), the fact that the submission was not even mentioned is significant.\n⁵⁸ It should be noted that the definition of force as used in Art. 2(4) of the Charter was not at issue in the case as the United States has a non-binding clause to multilateral treaties.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press DEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2. Definition of armed force\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case,⁶¹ claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania.⁶² The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’.⁶³ Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.⁶⁴\n⁵⁹ Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

The Court did not address\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press DEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed bands, including mercenaries, for incursion into the territory of another State.\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.\nStates have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal involving the use of force.\nThere are two points that may be taken from this extract.70 First, the Court considers the Declaration indicative of the international community's opinio juris that certain acts of indirect aggression may be a use of force prohibited by international law, albeit a lesser form.71 This is particularly salient for computer network attacks as many of the arguments raised against such actions being considered a use of force relate to the often indirect nature of their results.72 Secondly, the Court included intangible assistance such as 'encouragement'. While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE in the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press DEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE\n\n## 2.1. State actions\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated. See generally Lynn, 'Defending a New Domain'.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nto a national security threat, the Stuxnet virus acted as evidence and a timely wake-up call.\nTo date the clearest indication of state practice with regard to a specific computer network attack remains the international response to the attacks against Estonia in 2007. As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press DEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE China has often topped the lists of states engaged in or developing computer network attack capabilities.⁸⁵ China has been accused of hacking attacks against government computers in the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.⁸⁶ The Chinese government has denied any involvement in such attacks and, despite the problems of attribution, thus far it appears that the victim states have not considered the access and theft of information a use of force and are content to deal with them as cases of espionage. China has also claimed that it has sustained ‘massive’ and ‘shocking’ losses of state and military secrets via the internet.⁸⁷ Although they are non-international examples, Tibet and Taiwan have also repeatedly come under attack from alleged Chinese hackers, suspected to have the backing of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has denied all such claims, stating that ‘the Chinese government always opposes the activities of hackers’.⁸⁸ In September 2002 China announced that it had developed five new information warfare ⁸⁴ Ibid.\n⁸⁵ See, for example, McAfee, *Virtual Criminology Report*, McAfee Inc.

Bush signed a secret directive ordering the government to develop, for the first time, national-level guidance for determining when and how the United States would launch cyber attacks against enemy computer networks.⁹² The directive remains classified; however, US Secretary of State Clinton has remarked that ‘States, terrorists, and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks... Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation.’⁹³ In discussing the US cyber security strategy US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn has also outlined an ‘active defense’ strategy, which may include preemptive strikes against adversaries’ computer networks, although they are still wrestling with how to pursue the policy within the bounds of the law.⁹⁴ ⁸⁹ ‘Military Eyes Electronic Warfare’, Associated Press, South China Morning Post, 28 September 2002.\n⁹⁰ Krekal, et al., Capability of the PRC to Conduct Cyber Warfare, 16–22.\n⁹¹ Dan Verton, ‘The Prospect of Iraq Conflict Raises New Cyber Attack Fears’, Computerworld, 30 September 2002, www.computerworld.com/s/article/74688/Prospect_of_Iraq_conflict_raises_new_cyberattack_fears (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n⁹² Bradley Graham, ‘Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 7 February 2003, A1.\n⁹³ Remarks by US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks on Internet Freedom at The Newseum, Washington DC, 21 January 2010, www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁴ Lynn, ‘Defending a New Domain’; Ellen Nagashima, ‘U.S. Eyes Preemptive Cyber-Defense Strategy’, Washington Post (Washington DC), 29 August 2010, A05.

Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation.⁹⁶ While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner. To date, with the exception of the 'Farewell Dossier' incident, no computer network attack conclusively attributable to another state has caused physical damage or human injury.⁹⁷ ⁹⁵ Sverre Myrli, NATO and Cyber Defence, 173 DSCFC 09 E bis (2009), paras 58–61, www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=1782 (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁹⁶ 'Iran Says Nuclear Programme Was Hit by Sabotage'; 'Iran to Take Pre-Emptive Action against Cyber Terrorism: General', Tehran Times, 27 February 2011, Political Desk.\n⁹⁷ As noted previously, at the time of writing Stuxnet has not been conclusively attributed to any actor, although it is widely believed to be the work of a state/s actors.

Theories of force – scholastic writings Although they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one.⁹⁸ The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property.⁹⁹ Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury.¹⁰⁰ The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter.¹⁰¹ In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’.¹⁰² However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm.¹⁰³ Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years. At the date of writing, the media contains articles on the present conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq; however, they have also contained pieces on wars on terror, ⁹⁸ For an extensive analysis of the methodological debates over the prohibition on the use of force see Corten, ‘Controversies’.\n⁹⁹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362.\n¹⁰⁰ Bowett, Self-Defence, 184–99.\n¹⁰¹ Brownlie, Use of Force by States, 362. ¹⁰² Ibid.\n¹⁰³ See also Todd A. Morth, ‘Considering Our Position: Viewing Information Warfare as a Use of Force Prohibited by Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’ (1998) 30 Case W. Res. J.

This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind ¹⁰⁴ Frédéric Mégret, “War”? Legal Semantics and the Move to Violence’ (2002) 13(2) EJIL 361.\n¹⁰⁵ See, for example, Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the War against Terrorism’ (2002) 78 International Affairs 301, 306.

The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.¹¹⁰ Yoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force.¹¹¹ He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:¹¹² From a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify,¹¹³ it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for ¹⁰⁹ Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n¹¹⁰ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59. Interestingly, in the latter case the United States was in the position of the weaker state and argued that the economic coercion by the more powerful Arab states should be considered to be a use of force, a reversal of its position in the Cuban embargo.\n¹¹¹ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 103.\n¹¹² Ibid.\n¹¹³ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 911.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press DEFINITION OF ARMED FORCE The second school of legal theory writing on the subject of force is the more expansive, contextualist approach epitomised by the New Haven school writers such as Myers McDougal and Michael Reisman. In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale.¹¹⁵ McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.¹¹⁶ From this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority.¹¹⁷ He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order.¹¹⁸ That is, the critical ¹¹⁴ Ibid., 917.\n¹¹⁵ Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P. Feliciano, *Law and Minimum World Public Order: The Legal Regulation of International Coercion* (Yale University Press, New Haven, 1961).\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 153.\n¹¹⁷ These categories are self-defence; self-determination and decolonisation; humanitarian intervention; intervention by the military instrument to replace an elite in another state; uses of the military instrument within spheres of influence and critical defence zones; treaty-sanctioned interventions within the territory of another state; use of the military instrument for the gathering of evidence in international proceedings; use of the military instrument in enforcing international judgments; and countermeasures such as reprisals and retorsions. W. Michael Reisman, ‘Criteria for the Use of Force in International Law’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 279, 281.\n¹¹⁸ Ibid., 282. Reisman’s analysis is based on his concept of a complex ‘operational code’ for determining when the unilateral resort to force will be legitimate by states. For a summary of the factors in the operational code see Michael N. Schmitt, “The https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press question is not whether coercion has been applied, but whether it has been applied (a) in support of or against community order and basic policies, and (b) in ways in which the net consequences include congruence with community goals and minimum order.¹¹⁹ However, the contextualist position has fundamental difficulties. Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity.¹²⁰ The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force As noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against Resort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n¹¹⁹ Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n¹²⁰ Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE The difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.¹²² However, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:¹²³ (i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the ¹²¹ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n¹²² Ibid. ¹²³ Ibid., 914.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press operation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy.¹²⁴ He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter ¹²⁴ Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.¹²⁶\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n¹²⁵ Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n¹²⁶ Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands. See www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/ electronic.html for an account of the claim to invention of the computer by Alan Turing and the Virtual Bletchley Park for details of the role of electronic code breakers during World War II, www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/ (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n## Target intangibility\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n¹³⁰ See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n## Weapons intangibility\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force.¹³⁴ He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.¹³⁵ ¹³² Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n¹³³ For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n¹³⁴ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE However, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136] The problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n## 3.1.3. Locus Another argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE The main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China.¹⁴⁰ Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident.¹⁴¹ DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed ¹³⁸ See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H. W. Bush.\n¹³⁹ Although part of the northern Corfu Channel forms part of the territorial waters of Albania and Greece respectively, the international character of the waters and the rights of passage in international law through such waters illustrate the point at hand. Corfu Channel Case, 29.\n¹⁴⁰ See generally, Nathan Thornburgh, et al., ‘The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies (and the Man Who Tried to Stop Them)’ (2005) 166(10) Time 34.\n¹⁴¹ Emily Haslam, ‘Information Warfare: Technological Changes and International Law’ (2000) 5(2) JC&amp;SL 157, 162.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE conflict.¹⁴² There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state,¹⁴³ so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law.¹⁴⁴ The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n## 3.1.4. Result Computer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, the main ¹⁴² See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n¹⁴³ For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n¹⁴⁴ See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n¹⁴⁵ For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n¹⁴⁶ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE Given the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:¹⁴⁸ Information Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n¹⁴⁷ See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n¹⁴⁸ US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE Secondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n## 4. Conclusion The present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force), one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways. Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'. This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342.

In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.

Conclusion\n\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n^^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.

The complexity and sophistication of the virus and its multi-pronged attack vectors quickly led researchers to the conclusion that the most likely authors of the malware were state-backed professionals.¹ The fact that Iran was the most heavily hit target of the worm, including its Bashir and Natanz nuclear facilities, also added to the speculation.² Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly accused Israel and the West of being behind the attacks, announcing that unspecified malicious software sent by Western enemies had affected Iran's centrifuges at its Natanz enrichment plant and 'succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges'.³ However, at the time of writing no party has officially claimed responsibility and computer forensics have not conclusively established an author.⁴ Although there are no official\n\n¹ Stuxnet exploits four different vulnerabilities, a previously unheard of level of complexity in malware.

Iranian officials have also admitted that Stuxnet infected some computers at the Bashir nuclear power station but denied that any of the facility's control systems were affected.\n⁴ In a potentially embarrassing turn for Israel, the success of the Stuxnet cyber attack was celebrated in a video tribute of operational successes for the retiring head of the Israeli Defence Forces.

Converters are also used to control gas pipelines, chemical plants and a number of other different machines. It should also be recalled that the ‘Farewell Dossier’ pipeline explosion was the result of a piece of malware operating on the same principle;8 thus the seriousness of the threat should not be underestimated.\n\nThe cyber attacks on Estonia offer a different perspective on computer network attacks as a possible use of force. On 27 April 2007 Estonia became the victim of a prolonged series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks which brought the banking system, many government services and much of the media to a halt.9 Although no critical infrastructure was compromised, for a highly technologically dependent\n\ninvolvement in testing and development, although all are unsubstantiated.

The compromised computers are usually ones that have been recruited to a botnet (usually without their owner’s knowledge) and are controlled by a master computer.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Although no official statement regarding the cyber attacks was released by NATO, one of the clearest indications of the member states' views on computer network attacks came from Estonian defence minister Jaak Aaviksoo, who raised the matter with NATO:\n\nAt present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defence, will not automatically be extended to the attacked country ... Not a single NATO defence minister would define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present. However this matter needs to be resolved in the near future.¹³\n\nThis attitude is perhaps not surprising given the general reluctance of states to consider acts of indirect aggression as armed attacks;¹⁴ however, the incident is significant in that it is the first time that one state accused another of intentionally launching a computer network attack against it. In 2009 members of the Kremlin-backed youth group Nashi claimed that they were behind the attacks but denied that they were acting on the orders of the Russian government;¹⁵ the claim has not been corroborated. The incident bought to the fore important issues for the law regulating the use of force in international relations.

    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\ncontroversies surrounding the rule prohibiting the use of force had tended to focus on issues such as the conditions for self-defence or the existence of a right to humanitarian intervention,¹⁶ the advent of computer network attacks has renewed a far more fundamental question: what is the meaning of ‘force’ in the twenty-first century?\n\nThe prohibition of the use of force is one of the cornerstones of international law and is expressed in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter:\n\nAll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\n\nHowever, the prohibition is not restricted to the Charter; the International Court of Justice has repeatedly noted that it represents not only a principle of customary international law but also a ‘fundamental or cardinal principle of such law’.¹⁷ The Court also recalled that the International Law Commission had considered this provision to have the character of jus cogens.¹⁸ However, it must be recalled that Article 2(4) abolishes the threat or use of force only in the ‘international relations’ of member states; intrastate clashes and other actions by non-state actors are therefore out of reach of the Charter’s provision.¹⁹\n\n## 1. Force defined as armed force\n\nAlthough the prohibition of the threat or use of force is widely acknowledged as a cornerstone of both the United Nations Charter and of customary international law, Article 2(4) and the exact meaning of the word ‘force’ have been a source of debate since its enactment. The drafters of the Charter did not define the term, nor has the International Court of Justice or the General Assembly done so\n\n¹⁶ Olivier Corten, ‘The Controversies over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate’ (2005) 16 EJIL 803.\n\n¹⁷ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\n\nsince. One such debate has centred on whether ‘force’ is limited to armed force, or includes other forms of coercion such as political and economic measures. The issue of inclusion of political and economic coercion as uses of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter has been raised repeatedly, particularly by developing and former Eastern Bloc countries, since the San Francisco conference.²⁰ Although no definitive conclusions have been drawn, the prevailing and commonly accepted view put forward by scholars is that the force referred to in Article 2(4) is limited to armed force.²¹ As computer network attacks can result in a myriad of outcomes, and apparent state-sponsored attacks against financial infrastructure increase, these questions are likely to come to the fore again.²² Thus, the contours of the prohibition must be fleshed out in order to ascertain when attacks will be proscribed under Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law relating to the use of force in international law. The following discussion looks at the arguments from a textual analysis of the Charter wording, travaux préparatoires, historical background and academic analysis.²³\n\n## The Charter wording\n\nThe text of the United Nations Charter refers to force as an unqualified term twice in the entirety of the document, in Article 2(4) and Article 44. The use of the term in Article 44 appears in the context of Chapter VII, and supports a restrictive definition of ‘force’ by placing it in close conjunction with Articles 41 and 42 using the qualified term ‘armed force’, clearly suggesting that the force contemplated by the unqualified term is armed. Article 44 states:\n\n²⁰ Albrecht Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002), 118.\n²¹ See, for example, ibid., 117; Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 86.\n²² For example, in 2010 both the Nasdaq and London stock exchanges were hacked, although at the time of writing both attacks appear to be aimed at exfiltrating data rather than crashing the systems or altering trading algorithms.\n²³ Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 sets out the core interpretive principles that a treaty should be interpreted in ‘good faith’ and in accordance with ‘the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose’. Interpreters of a treaty may include in the context: the preamble, any treaty or instrument made in connection with the treaty, subsequent conduct and practice of the parties and any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. Art. 32 states that recourse may be made to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. The following sections consider each of these in turn.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nWhen the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces.\n\nThe decision to use force refers to the preceding Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, which permit the Security Council to authorise actions necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, including the use of force. Article 41 relates to ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ which may include ‘complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations’.²⁴ Article 42 allows the Security Council to ‘take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security’ and is the article under which the Security Council mandates the use of armed force in international law under the phrase ‘all necessary means’.²⁵ Thus the use of the term ‘force’ to refer to the Security Council’s choice of the latter of these two options – specifically distinguished from measures not amounting to ‘armed force’ in the text of Article 41 – suggests that the force referred to in Article 44 and hence in Article 2(4) is also armed force.\n\nFurther support for this view can be found in paragraph 7 of the preamble of the Charter which states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’. As Michael Schmitt has pointed out, the articles of the Charter are designed to give effect to its pre-ambular aspirations.²⁶ Accordingly, if Article 2(4) were intended to extend beyond armed force, then presumably the preamble, for reasons of internal consistency, would not have included the term ‘armed’. This paragraph accords with the relationship apparent between Article 2(4) and Chapter VII of the Charter, in particular Article 42 relating to Security Council authorisation of armed force, as discussed above.\n\n²⁴ Note that this would tend to indicate that none of these measures would be considered breaches of Article 2(4) were they to be taken unilaterally by individual states, whether they were conducted by computer network attacks or by more conventional means.\n\n²⁵ The list of actions includes ‘demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces’.\n\n²⁶ Michael N.

    "FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\n\nAlbrecht Randelzhofer has also put forward a teleological interpretation of the wording of Article 2(4). Randelzhofer argues that were Article 2(4) to extend to other forms of force, such as economic and political coercion, states would be left with no legal means of exerting pressure on states that violate international law.²⁷ Such a consequence would be unacceptable to the international community in an age where the organs of that community are unable to effectively ensure compliance with international law.\n\n## Travaux préparatoires and historical background\n\nThe preparatory materials of the Charter do not contain any specific discussion regarding the precise meaning of the term force in Article 2(4); however, the discussions around a number of proposed amendments to the article shed some light on the intentions of the states at the time.\n\nThe travaux préparatoires of Article 2(4) detail a proposal by the foreign minister of Brazil to specifically extend the prohibition to the threat or use of ‘economic measures’ which was firmly rejected.²⁸ Although Randelzhofer has cited this as evidence that military force is the only intended concern of the prohibition, David Harris states that it is unclear from the texts whether the rejection of the Brazilian amendment is proof that the Article was not intended to prohibit economic force, or that the term force in Article 2(4) was thought sufficient to cover it without specific mention.²⁹ The latter view appears to stem from the Belgian delegate’s comments regarding Brazil’s proposed amendment and the phrase ‘or any other manner’.³⁰ Despite this, writers have generally concluded that the better view is that Western states were not prepared to admit anything other than armed force.³¹\n\n²⁷ Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2(4)’, 118.\n\n²⁸ ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 215, I/1/10, 6 UNCIO (6 May 1945) 334, 559 (rejected by 2 votes in favour, 26 against).\n\n²⁹ D. J. Harris, *Cases and Materials on International Law* (6th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2004), 890.\n\n³⁰ The Belgian delegate suggested that the delegate of Brazil had underestimated the effect of the modifications made in the original text, calling attention particularly to the phrase ‘in any other manner’; and also recalled that the subcommittee had given the point about ‘economic measures’ careful consideration and for good reasons decided against: ‘Summary Report of Eleventh Meeting of Committee I/1’ Doc. 784, I/1/27, 5 June 1945, 6 UNCIO (1945), 334.\n\n³¹ However the Western states were prepared to admit, as stated by the UK representative, that ‘that was not to say that all forms of economic and political pressure which threatened the territorial integrity and political independence of another state were permissible, they might well constitute illegal intervention’.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nWhile developing states have tried to raise the issue of prohibiting use of economic and political coercion on other occasions, each time it has received a negative vote from Western powers.\n\nIt is also of note that in the discussion following a proposed amendment to Article 2(4) requiring members to collectively resist the use of aggression (as opposed to force),[32] one of the primary objections to the amendment was the lack of definition of the term aggression. The debate caused the United Kingdom representative to comment:[33]\n\nApart however from the difficulty in defining aggression and therefore of knowing what the nations were pledged to resist, the use as a standard of an inexplicit word, such as aggression, instead of something explicit such as 'force' would give an opportunity to a state to engage in an act of aggression while calling it by another name.\n\nIt is apparent from this statement that the term force was considered an explicit term, and, as Bond has pointed out, such a characterisation of the term at that time was not questionable; it was clear that force meant military or armed force, and in 1945 that meant traditional weapons employed in traditional ways.[34] Further, in the same discussion a representative of the United States pointed out that in the future there would be many kinds of aggression and that these would be covered in the Charter by the words 'threat to the peace'.[35] This indicates that at the time the discussions surrounding Article 2(4) and its proposed amendments were taking place, the perception of force was as a specific (armed) threat and all other incidents which would require flexibility of drafting would be covered by the more general phrase 'threat to the peace' under Article 39 and the collective security arrangements in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n\n[32] 'Summary Report of Twelfth Meeting of Committee I/1' Doc. 810, I/1/30, 6 UNCIO (6 June 1945) 342.

    "FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\n\nAn examination of the historical background of the Charter reveals its development against a backdrop of international efforts to eliminate the unilateral recourse to armed force, and also provides insight into the intentions of the drafters of Article 2(4). In his work on the historical context of Article 2(4), Edward Gordon has argued that the problems of interpretation arise because it is a ‘legal rule located in the text of a multilateral treaty which requires adaptation to changing circumstances’; the challenge becomes one of remaining faithful to its core meaning without thereby sacrificing the flexibility required in interpreting constitution norms.³⁶ The historical antecedents of Article 2(4) are the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The former (as amended), states that ‘any war or threat of war’ is a matter of concern for the whole League,³⁷ and that members of the League will preserve the ‘territorial integrity and existing political independence’ of members of the League against external aggression.³⁸ The genetic roots of the present Article 2(4) are clearly visible in the wording. In the years between the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the adoption of the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928, the League Assembly passed unanimous resolutions condemning wars of aggression as international crimes. Indeed, the Pan American conference in 1926 considered such wars to be crimes against the human species.³⁹\n\nUnder the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, states parties ‘condemn the recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another’.⁴⁰ However the precise scope of the prohibition on war\n\n³⁶ Edward Gordon, ‘Article 2(4) in Historical Context’ (1985) 10 Yale J. Int’l L. 271, 273.\n³⁷ Art. 11, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary General shall on the request of any Member of the League forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.’\n³⁸ Art. 10, Covenant of the League of Nations reads as follows: ‘The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.’\n³⁹ W.

However, each of the attempts has left the central issue of the essential nature of ‘force’ unresolved. It appears that the ambiguity of the wording has been the price of international consensus.⁴⁶\n\nTwo other international instruments drafted around the time of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the North Atlantic Treaty (forming NATO), also use the term force without qualification. Perhaps unsurprisingly given their status as collective defence organisations, neither provides any support for the inclusion of economic or political coercion as a use of force. The North Atlantic Treaty uses the terminology of the UN Charter and although Article 2 separately addresses economic concerns it does not refer to economic coercion.⁴⁷\n\nThe Charter of the OAS (as subsequently amended) refers to the prohibition on the use of force in other treaties in Article 22, however\n\n⁴¹ Harris, Cases and Materials, 861.\n⁴² Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force by States (Oxford University Press, 1963), 87.\n⁴³ Ibid.

    "FORCE DEFINED AS ARMED FORCE\n\nforce is used as an unqualified term and no guidance is given as to its meaning.⁴⁸ However, when discussing such measures for the purposes of its own obligations, Articles 19 and 20 of the OAS Charter avoid using the term force without qualification by using ‘armed force’ and ‘coercive measures of an economic or political character’ as separate terms. Michael Schmitt notes that this is perhaps unsurprising given Brazil’s attempt at amending Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and their membership of the OAS.⁴⁹ It is clear that the language employed by the OAS Charter is meant to be interpreted far more broadly than the ‘use of force’ language of Article 2(4). However, as a number of commentators have pointed out, the language is so broad as to be legally unenforceable;⁵⁰ if read literally, it outlaws diplomacy.⁵¹\n\nThe issue was addressed again twenty-five years after the signing of the Charter, in the 1970 General Assembly Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (hereinafter Declaration on Friendly Relations).⁵² The section on the principle of the use of force does not clarify the matter as it merely refers to ‘force’. This was the result of disagreement between the Western states, who argued that the prohibition only related to armed force, and the Soviet Bloc, European and developing states, who argued that ‘all forms of pressure, including those of a political and economic character, which have the effect of threatening the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’, were prohibited.⁵³ However the Western states were prepared to admit, presciently in the light of the\n\n⁴⁸ Art. 22 states that ‘The American States bind themselves in their international relations not to have recourse to the use of force, except in the case of self-defense in accordance with existing treaties or in fulfilment thereof’; Charter of the Organisation of American States, 30 April 1948, 119 UNTS 3 TIAS No. 2361.\n\n⁴⁹ Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 906.\n\n⁵⁰ Richard W.

The Court quotes from the sections of the Declaration dealing specifically with the principle of the non-use of force, but also from the principle of non-intervention. In citing the latter, the Court leaves out the opening sentence of the paragraph dealing with political and economic coercion, and only quotes the second sentence relating to armed groups.⁵⁶ This is despite Nicaragua’s submissions that the country had been subjected to economic coercion at the hands of the United States.⁵⁷ This omission, and the failure of the Court to consider Nicaragua’s submissions in that regard when discussing Article 2(4) and the associated customary law, indicates that the Court does not include such measures in the definition of force as used in customary international law and the UN Charter.⁵⁸\n\nSince the Nicaragua (Merits) case, the international community has once again affirmed the prohibition against force in the 1987 Declaration on\n\n⁵⁴ UK representative (Mr Sinclair), UN Doc.

Definition of armed force\n\nThe international jurisprudence indicates that while the definition of force is to be limited to armed force, the definition of armed force itself is to be interpreted widely. In particular, a direct application of armed force by a state is not necessary for the state to fall foul of Article 2(4), nor have states been able to successfully circumvent the prohibition by arguing that an incident does not affect the territorial integrity or political independence of a state.\n\nThe latter argument was raised by the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel Case,⁶¹ claiming that their mine-sweeping actions in Albanian territorial waters were not in breach of Article 2(4) as they were not directed against the territorial integrity or political independence of Albania.⁶² The International Court of Justice dismissed the narrow interpretation of force, holding that the British action of sending warships to clear mines from the Corfu Channel against the express wishes of Albania amounted to a ‘policy of force’ such as had given rise to ‘most serious abuses and such as cannot … find a place in international law’.⁶³ Interestingly, despite this argument being dismissed by the Court in the Corfu Channel Case, Belgium raised the same argument in its pleadings on provisional measures following NATO’s military operations over Kosovo in 1999.⁶⁴\n\n⁵⁹ Arts 7 and 8, Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principle of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations GAOR 42nd sess., 73rd plen. mtg., UN Doc.

    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nThe International Court of Justice's broad interpretation of the scope of the term force can also be seen in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, where the Court held that certain indirect forms of support are included in the prohibition against force. The Court's judgment states that acts which breach the principle of non-intervention 'will also, if they directly or indirectly involve the use of force, constitute a breach of the principle of non-use of force in international relations'.[65] In that case, the Court accepted that the provision of assistance to rebel fighters 'in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support' could constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of a state.[66] However, not all forms of indirect action or assistance were to be so considered. In particular, the Court found that 'the mere supply of funds to the contras, while undoubtedly an act of intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua', would not breach the prohibition of force as contemplated by Article 2(4) and the corresponding customary law.[67] In a controversial discussion, the Court also distinguishes between the gravest forms of the use of force, those that constitute an armed attack or aggression, and other uses of force, referred to by the Court as 'less grave forms'.[68] The Court used the Declaration on Friendly Relations to elucidate these lesser forms of force and determine the legal rules that may apply to them.[69] In particular, the Court emphasised the following paragraphs of the Declaration:\n\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use of force to violate the existing international boundaries of another State or as a means of solving international disputes, including territorial disputes and problems concerning frontiers of States.\n\nEvery State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and\n\nthese arguments and refused provisional measures on the basis that it lacked prima facie jurisdiction on the merits of the case.\n\n65 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 209.\n66 Ibid., para. 193.\n67 Ibid., para. 228.\n68 Ibid., para. 191. Much criticism has been directed at the Nicaragua (Merits) decision based on this elucidation of various levels of force, particularly from American authors. See, for example, the panel discussion reported at American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision' (1987) 81 ASIL Proc. 258.\n69 Nicaragua (Merits), para. 191.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

While it is reading too much into the judgment to treat this as evidence of a prohibition against intangible force, the words 'armed intervention and all other forms of interference' imply intent to reach at least some kinds of non-forcible activities. The reports of the special committee delegated the task of drafting the Declaration on Friendly Relations indicate that the participating states had little shared notion of what sort of non-forcible conduct would fall under the proscriptions\n\n70 Again the Court's approach in using the Declaration has been controversial. Some authors argue that the Court has used the Declaration as a source of law, a position which the states parties to the resolution would never have intended. Authors have also criticised the Court for using the text of the Declaration as indicative of opinio juris of the international community without also fully examining the actions of states: see generally, American Society of International Law, 'The Jurisprudence of the Court in the Nicaragua Decision'. But cf. Lori Fisler Damrosch, 'Politics across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence over Domestic Affairs' (1989) 83 AJIL 1, 8.\n\n71 This is in accord with the drafting history of Article 3g of the Definition of Aggression which rejected a proposal to include several of the broad range of activities listed as indirect aggression in the Declaration on Friendly Relations. See Pierluigi L. Zanardi, 'Indirect Military Aggression' in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation on the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 111-19, 116.\n\n72 The indirectness of computer network attacks is addressed in section 3.1.1 below.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nin the Declaration.73 While ‘encouragement’ may take many forms, some tangible and some not, the inclusion of ‘organisation or encouragement’ would suggest that an intangible form was envisaged as well. It is interesting in this regard to compare the Court’s earlier treatment of the encouraging statements made by the Ayatollah Khomeini in the Tehran Hostages case.74 Although the case did not consider the Declaration on Friendly Relations, the Court considered that the Ayatollah’s statements were not sufficient to impute state responsibility for the initial actions of student militants in overrunning the US embassy in Tehran. However, the Court did hold that such statements were sufficient to turn the continued occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into acts of the state. The Court did not consider whether the continuing occupation (or the initial attack)75 constituted a breach of Article 2(4) of the Charter which had been argued by the United States and dealt with the matter solely with respect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity.\n\nWhile some commentators have argued that the Nicaragua (Merits) case extends the definition of force into things that begin to resemble economic and political coercion, the current author considers that the better view is that force is still restricted by the Court to military (or paramilitary) action; however, such force may be imputed through indirect means such as agency. The extension provided by the Court remains tied to armed force, whether in person or by proxy.\n\nThe Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case regarded the Charter provisions as dynamic rather than fixed, and thus as capable of change over time through state practice.76 Although the Court accepted the parties’ position that the Charter provisions represented customary law, it also accepted the possibility of the development of new law on forcible intervention allowing a new exception to the prohibition on the use of\n\n73 Damrosch, ‘Politics across Borders’, 10.\n74 Case Concerning the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States v. Iran) (1980) 74 AJIL 746, International Court of Justice, para. 59. In that case the Ayatollah had made several public declarations inveighing against the United States and holding the US responsible for the trouble besetting that country. On 1 November the Ayatollah had made a statement declaring it was ‘up to the dear pupils, students and theological students to expand with all their might their attacks against the United States and Israel, so that they may force the United States to return the deposed and Criminal Shah, and to condemn this great plot’. Further, congratulatory statements from the Ayatollah following the attack and other statements of official approval were also made.\n75 Presumably because of the lack of imputability to a state party.\n76 Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 7.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In setting out the area covered by the prohibition against force, the Court stated that Article 2(4) of the Charter represented only part of the customary international law relating to the use of force and stated that the UN Charter 'by no means covers the whole area of the regulation of the use of force in international relations'.[77] The Court pointed out that the right to self-defence stood alongside the Charter and that the Charter text did not go on to regulate all of the aspects of that rule. Bearing that in mind, we need now to turn to state practice and the theories of force propounded by other academics.\n\n## 2.1. State actions\n\nGiven the classified and covert nature of most computer network attacks, a survey of state practice in relation to this type of incident is problematic at best. To date there have not been any computer network attacks that are conclusively attributable to a state outside of traditional conflict scenarios. However, some states have made statements regarding the use of computer network attacks and other analogous information operations. As has been stated, one of the most difficult issues surrounding computer network attacks is positive attribution of an attack to the perpetrator, as a matter of fact, as well as a matter of law. Most of the incidents detailed below and in Appendix 1 have suffered from this difficulty, thus making statements of limited use. However, although they must be used with care, the statements, actions and reactions of states also form part of the interpretive framework of Article 2(4).\n\nWhile international recognition of the security threat that computer network attacks represent has been gradual, in the last few years states' recognition of the problem has solidified into action. Many states have set up cyber commands within their militaries and other institutions in reaction to reported incidents of computer network exploitation and joint exercises which have exposed vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.[78] For those that remained sceptical of the potential of computer network attacks to cause physical damage sufficient to amount\n\n[77] Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n\n[78] Established cyber commands at the time of writing include the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, China as well as NATO. The establishment of the US Cyber Command, despite being lobbied for several years, only got final approval following Operation Buckshot Yankee in 2008 in which US military networks were compromised by a foreign intelligence agency and sensitive data exfiltrated.

As noted previously, the attacks did not affect critical infrastructure, damage physical property or cause human injury. It appears that states were not prepared to make definitive public statements regarding the attacks as a use of force.79 NATO member states were certainly not prepared to accept that the attacks amounted to an armed attack which would initiate the collective self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic treaty; however, a NATO spokesperson commented that the attacks were a security issue which concerned NATO.80 Russia denied all accusations of computer network attacks, noting that the Kremlin came under attack many hundreds of times a day.81 Russian officials have previously stated that they will view the effects of a computer network attack as similar to that of the use of weapons of mass destruction and that:82\n\n[f]rom a military point of view, the use of information warfare means against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non military phase of a conflict, whether there were casualties or not ... Russia retains the right to use nuclear weapons first against the means and forces of information warfare, and then against the aggressor state itself.\n\nHowever, this statement has not been reflected in Russia's response to computer network attacks in the 2008 conflict over South Ossetia. Small-scale attacks were occurring between the two countries for almost two months before the outbreak of hostilities;83 however, there\n\n79 For example, the US called the attacks 'unacceptable' and 'pressure on an independent country' but stopped short of calling the attacks force: 'Rice Condemns Ongoing Cyber-Attacks as Estonian Embassy Siege Ends', earthtimes.org 4 May 2007.\n\n80 AFP, 'Cyber Attacks on Estonia Are Security Issue: NATO Chief', The Age (Melbourne), 26 May 2007.\n\n81 'The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia', BBC News, 17 May 2007.

Unsurprisingly, Iran has stated that an 'electronic war' has been launched against the country, and has stated that it will take pre-emptive cyber action against the centres which launch such attacks within the framework of international regulation.⁹⁶ While states have spoken widely about the innovative technological nature of the threat, statements concerning the legal nature of the attack have largely been absent. This may reflect a general consensus in the international community that the worm was a use of force, an unwillingness to comment while attribution has not been proved, or merely satisfaction at the outcome of the attack regardless of its legal nature. Such reactions and policy statements tend to indicate that states remain cautious about labelling computer network attacks as a use of force. Although both the United States and Russia have reserved the right to respond with force against computer network attacks they have not made any comments indicating that any computer network attack reported to date should be viewed in this manner.

    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\n## 2.2. Theories of force – scholastic writings\n\nAlthough they are in agreement over the customary nature of the prohibition on the use of force, commentators remain deeply divided over the content of the rule. Theories of force and discussion of Article 2(4) of the Charter have come mainly from two different schools of legal theory, those adopting a restrictive approach and those adopting a more expansive one.⁹⁸ The first, tending to come from the positivist school, provides a definition of ‘force’ and determines whether a particular incident falls within the accepted definition. The extensive or contextualist approach tends to focus more on custom and the context of force.\n\nIan Brownlie uses a two-part definition requiring the use of a weapon which is employed for the destruction of life and property.⁹⁹ Bowett refers to the possible resort to a violent weapon which inflicts human injury.¹⁰⁰ The question of the need for physical means and the requirement of a weapon came to the fore with the advent of chemical and biological weapons. Ian Brownlie addressed the issue in 1963, considering whether weapons ‘which do not involve any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’ involved a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter.¹⁰¹ In concluding that these weapons should fall within the prohibition, he gives two reasons. The first, is that the ‘agencies concerned are commonly referred to as “weapons” and as forms of “warfare”’.¹⁰² However, as has been seen in the preceding chapter, this may not be helpful in terms of categorising computer network attacks as force. Both the popular press and academics across disciplines have used the terms information warfare, cyber war and even computer network attack to refer to a vast range of information operations, many of which would never be considered force under the Charter paradigm.¹⁰³ Further, the terms ‘war’ and ‘weapons’ have found an increasingly political meaning in recent years.

Used in this manner, the term war is merely used to signify resolve,¹⁰⁴ a point that has been noted by legal commentators and politicians alike.¹⁰⁵ Thus the semantics of war and weaponry are no longer useful criteria in determining whether something is a use of force.¹⁰⁶ Further, as was seen in the 2001 anthrax scares in the United States and the release of sarin gas on a Tokyo subway train in 1995, the requirement of a weapons-based delivery system is not essential for a chemical or biological attack. The International Court of Justice has also noted in its advisory opinion on Nuclear Weapons that the provisions relating to the use of force in the Charter do not refer to specific weapons but rather apply to the use of force regardless of the weapons employed.¹⁰⁷\n\nBrownlie’s second and more convincing argument was that the use of chemical and biological weapons should be viewed as force because such ‘weapons are employed for the destruction of life and property’.¹⁰⁸ In advancing his analysis, Brownlie moves the test beyond the kinetic impact of shock waves and heat and toward a wider, results-oriented approach. This view is also representative of the requirement of a large number of commentators who argue for a physical outcome to a computer network attack. However a purely results-driven approach raises problems of its own in that it risks reopening the arguments relating to the inclusion of political and economic coercion. As Cassandra LaRae-Perez points out, once a results-based perspective is adopted, the effects of long-term, comprehensive economic sanctions of the kind\n\n¹⁰⁴ Frédéric Mégret, “War”?

The rigorous economic embargo that the United States has enforced against Cuba since the early 1960s has not been considered to be a use of force; likewise, neither has the Arab embargo of Israel.¹¹⁰\n\nYoram Dinstein likewise argues for a results-based approach when discussing computer network attacks in the context of an armed attack, recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case as a subset of the use of force.¹¹¹ He argues that violent consequences are the key to fulfilling the definition of armed attack:¹¹²\n\nFrom a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack. A premeditated destructive [computer network attack (CNA)] can qualify as an armed attack just as much as a kinetic attack bringing about the same or similar results – the crux of the matter is not the medium at hand (a computer server in lieu of, say an artillery battery), but the violent consequences of the action taken. If there is a cause and effect chain between the CNA and these violent consequences, it is immaterial that they were produced by high and not low technology.\n\nDinstein's realist argument focuses solely on the consequences of an attack. As shown above, a purely consequence-based approach in an area that lacks the tangibility of traditional military/armed force blurs the distinction with the grey area occupied by political and economic coercion. Thus a theory of force which requires only a particular outcome is insufficient to cover the concerns raised by forms of coercion which the international community is agreed (for the most part) are not to be included as uses of force. Michael Schmitt has argued that not only is a purely consequence-based approach extraordinarily difficult to quantify or qualify,¹¹³ it would also constitute a new normative standard altogether and as such would prove a difficult case for\n\n¹⁰⁹ Cassandra LaRae-Perez, ‘Economic Sanctions as a Use of Force: Re-Evaluating the Legality of Sanctions from an Effects-Based Perspective’ (2002) 20 BU Int'l L.J. 161.\n\n¹¹⁰ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 59.

In his work *Law and Minimum World Public Order*, Myers McDougal argued that force is merely a degree of major coercion and violence on a transnational scale.¹¹⁵ McDougal thus places all forms of coercion on this scale and addresses the problem of the characterisation of the particular coercion as permissible or non-permissible from variables based on past actions, extrapolated forward in accordance with those variables’ probable consequences upon the goal values of the kind of world order the scholar prefers.¹¹⁶\n\nFrom this perspective, the basic intellectual task is one of characterising the variable contextual factors and policies which relate to the distinction between permissible and impermissible coercion for the guidance of differing particular decision makers.\n\nDeveloping the theory further, Michael Reisman sets out nine categories where he believes the use of force has achieved some form of international legal authority.¹¹⁷ He argues that in determining whether a particular act of coercion is lawful or not, the question to be answered is whether a particular act (whatever its justification otherwise) enhances or undermines world order.¹¹⁸ That is, the critical\n\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 917.\n\n¹¹⁵ Myres Smith McDougal and Florentino P.

Olivier Corten points out, no ‘objective law’ exists that expresses social necessities or the solidarity mechanisms that characterise the international community; it is the interpreter and the interpreter alone who gives sense to what is required in a particular case by those necessities or that solidarity.¹²⁰ The idea that the fundamental goals of the community must prevail over any particular rule of law, namely the rule prohibiting armed force, would remove all certainty from international relations, leaving the outcome of any diplomatic encounter highly uncertain as to its legality. And, ultimately, that uncertainty is a greater threat to communal values and goals. This methodological schism permeates the debates on the legality of computer network attacks as a use of force and divides commentators on the correct approach to take to this emerging form of warfare.\n\n## 3. Computer network attacks as a use of force\n\nAs noted above, two main theories of force have emerged out of the current writing in relation to the prohibition against force. The first is a more restrictive positivist approach which looks at the rules formulated by the international community, in this case the prohibition against force, and argues that anything falling outside that prohibition is legal. Authors adhering to this school include Ian Brownlie, Yoram Dinstein, Christine Gray and, in respect of computer network attacks, James Bond. The second is the more expansive contextualist approach which contends that all coercion falls along a continuum and the position along the continuum is the result of several factors which affect the minimum world order. Elements of the contextualist approach can be seen in the work of Michael Schmitt, and are given full expression by Michael Reisman.\n\nAs we have seen above, a results-based approach to the question as to whether a particular attack contravenes the prohibition against\n\nResort to Force in International Law: Reflections on Positivist and Contextualist Approaches’ (1994) 37 AFL Rev. 105.\n\n¹¹⁹ Reisman, ‘Criteria’, 284.\n¹²⁰ Corten, ‘Controversies’, 814.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n63\n\n'armed force' leads towards an erosion of the exclusion of economic and political coercion. Michael Schmitt has suggested that the use of force proscription is based on the desire of the international community to foster and advance the aspirational values set out in the preamble to the Charter. The prohibition on 'armed' force is thus a kind of instrumental shorthand way to restrict those acts that are most likely to endanger those objectives and aims. Schmitt argues that the international community is not concerned so much with the instrumentality of the coercion but rather the consequences of its use.¹²¹ However, given that the range of possible consequences of any given kind of attack (i.e. denial of service, virus, direct intrusions etc.) range along a continuum, assessing the consequences of an attack can be a Sisyphean task, making the criteria for placement upon that continuum extremely difficult.\n\nThe difficulty in looking to consequences themselves as criteria for calculating lawfulness led the Charter drafters to use prescriptive shorthand to achieve their goal. Because force represents a consistently serious menace to intermediate and ultimate objectives, the prohibition of resort to it is a relatively reliable instrument-based surrogate for a ban on deleterious consequences. It eases the evaluative process by simply asking whether force has been used rather than requiring a far more difficult assessment of the consequences that have arisen.¹²²\n\nHowever, as seen above with reference to economic and political coercion, it cannot be the case that the only criteria to be used are the consequence-based ones. In his article setting out a normative framework for the analysis of computer network attacks, Michael Schmitt has attempted to bridge the gap between instrument-based and consequence-based interpretations. Schmitt proposes seven factors which are to be taken into account when determining whether an attack will constitute a use of force:¹²³\n\n(i) Severity of the damage: if people are killed or there is extensive property damage, the action is probably military; the less damage, the less likely the action is a use of force.\n\n(ii) Immediacy of the consequences of the attack: When the effects are seen within seconds to minutes (such as when a bomb explodes), the\n\n¹²¹ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 911.\n¹²² Ibid. ¹²³ Ibid., 914.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "64 COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\noperation is probably military; if the effects take weeks or months to appear, it is more likely diplomatic or economic.\n\n(iii) Directness: If the action taken is the sole cause of the result, it is more likely to be viewed as a use of force; as the link between cause and effect attenuates, so does the military nature of the act.\n\n(iv) Invasiveness of the act into the target state: A violated border is still an indicator of military operations; actions that are mounted from outside a target nation's borders are probably more diplomatic or economic.\n\n(v) Measurability of the damage: If the effect can be quantified immediately – such as photographing a ‘smoking hole’ where the target used to be – the operation has a strong military character; the more subjective the process for evaluating the damage, the more diplomatic or economic.\n\n(vi) Presumptive legitimacy: State actors have a monopoly on the legitimate use of kinetic force, while other non-kinetic actions – attacks through or in cyberspace – are often permissible in a wider set of circumstances; actions that have not been the sole province of nation-states are less likely to be viewed as military.\n\n(vii) Responsibility: If a state takes visible responsibility for any destructive act, it is more likely to be characterized as a traditional military operation; ambiguous responsibility militates for a non-military label.\n\nSchmitt’s analysis, in particular his criteria of presumptive legitimacy, has been criticised by Jason Barkham for begging the question of legitimacy.¹²⁴ He argues that it essentially requires a victim state to ask whether an act determining the legitimacy of an attack under international law (i.e., distinguishing between acts of coercion and uses of force) by asking whether the attack is legitimate.\n\nMany of Schmitt’s criteria are undoubtedly useful in determining post-facto whether the prohibition has been breached; however, the current author considers that the criteria make insufficient allowance for the unique characteristics of computer network attacks, and the changing nature of global society, for an attack analysis. For example, while an attack is ongoing at the current state of technology, it takes weeks if not months to determine responsibility for an act. In a military age typified by remote weaponry and stand-off tactics, the criterion of a violated border is also losing its relevance. The Court in the Nuclear Weapons advisory case stated that in order to apply the Charter\n\n¹²⁴ Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’ (2001) 34 New York University Journal of International Law 57.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n65\n\nlaw on the use of force and the law applicable in armed conflict, it was essential to take account of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons.¹²⁵ The same approach may be adopted in respect of computer network attacks.\n\n## 3.1. Characteristics of computer network attacks\n\nThe problem with defining computer network attacks as a use of force under current international law is an obvious one. As noted, the contemporary prohibition on the use of force (both as treaty and customary law) has its roots firmly in the text of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and at the time of its drafting the science of computing had not advanced to such a state where it could be considered to be any sort of threat.¹²⁶\n\nThe problems that arise from considering a computer network attack as a use of force stem from the fundamental characteristics of such attacks. Despite the wide range of attacks which fall under the heading of computer network attack, it is possible to distil four characteristics of a computer network attack which distinguish it from its conventional counterparts: indirectness, intangibility, locus, and result. Some of these characteristics do not raise significant problems for contemporary jus ad bellum and are easily solved within the existing framework; however, other characteristics raise more difficult issues. This section examines each of these characteristics and the arguments that have been advanced to militate against such attacks falling within the definition of force. As will be seen, most arguments can be dealt with under existing law.\n\n## 3.1.1. Indirectness\n\nAlthough direct computer network attacks are certainly possible, for example the infiltration of a dam's control system to send water downstream, a large number of possible attacks will manipulate one system to achieve a knock-on effect from something else. Examples of such\n\n¹²⁵ Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 36.\n\n¹²⁶ Indeed in 1945 the breakthrough towards modern computing was just beginning. Notwithstanding the important role the Colossus machine played in the British/ Allied war efforts at Bletchley Park in breaking the ciphers used by the highest level Germans for strategic commands.

    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nindirect attacks include a manipulation of GPS satellite systems to send an opposing force's missiles off target, manipulation of hospital blood type data resulting in the wrong blood type being given to enemy soldiers, or disabling air traffic control systems. These examples all involve an action which requires further action to be taken by a second actor or object to achieve the desired result. Indirectness per se has not been an issue for international law. As seen above, the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case has held that indirect assistance can be a use of force contrary to international law. The Court based its reasoning as follows:\n\nThe element of coercion, which defines, and indeed forms the very essence of, prohibited intervention, is particularly obvious in the case of an intervention which uses force, either in the direct form of military action, or in the indirect form of support for subversive or terrorist armed activities within another State. As noted above (paragraph 191), General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) equates assistance of this kind with the use of force by the assisting State when the acts committed in another State 'involve a threat or use of force'.[127]\n\nHowever, it should be noted in these cases that the further action to be taken has involved a traditional use of armed force. Where the subsequent action would not constitute a 'threat or use of force', such as the example of the hospital records, it seems unlikely under present interpretations of the law that the action could be considered a use of force. Further, not all assistance given to the rebels was considered to be contrary to the prohibition against force; mere supply of funds to the contras did not in itself amount to a use of force.[128] Therefore the causal nexus between an act of a state and a destructive effect on the victim state will be of critical importance.\n\nAnother issue arises where the party who is being 'assisted' has no wish or intention to cause damage but is being used as the unwilling agent of the attacking actor. This is the case where computers are recruited to botnets and used to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a target computer or system. This was one of the main tactics of both the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. While primarily a question of attribution, where a state-owned computer is used in this manner, the effect may appear to be a state-sponsored attack of another state's systems.[129] This was the case in\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n67\n\nthe attacks against Estonia in 2007; although computers inside the Kremlin were used in the attacks, subsequent analysis of the attacks concluded that those computers could well have been compromised by the groups of patriotic hackers generally believed to be responsible for the attacks.¹³⁰ Thus the indirectness of the attack obfuscates the true perpetrator of the attack, and increases the risk that countermeasures may be directed at innocent parties. While this may be viewed as a desirable effect by an attacking state in that it permits a high level of plausible deniability, such opacity makes the task of determining the correct legal standard to apply while the attack is ongoing that much harder.\n\n## 3.1.2. Intangibility\n\nThe second characteristic of computer network attacks is the intangibility of the attack, both in terms of the method of warfare and the consequences of an attack. While it may be possible to point at a single piece of malicious code that has caused the problem, legally speaking the problem of intangibility exists on three levels. First, the target of the attack may not exist in the physical world other than as information held on a server. Secondly, the 'weapon' itself is intangible, a piece of binary coding which may cause catastrophic effect. Thirdly, the type of damage the attack causes may also be intangible. A computer network attack that does not touch the physical sphere may nevertheless cause mayhem; the oft-cited hypothetical example is an attack on the New York stock exchange that causes mayhem and panic in the United States. This last aspect of intangibility will be examined in section 3.1.4 below.\n\n## Target intangibility\n\nComputer network attacks, by definition, target information and information systems. However, they may be divided into those which target information systems in order to affect hardware and other physical aspects, and those which target information as its own end. Where the target of an attack is ultimately a physical entity, such as manipulating software controlling the rotation speed of nuclear centrifuges, the effects of a computer network attack fit more easily with current experience. The more difficult issue arises where the target\n\n¹³⁰ See generally Heise Security, *Estonian DDoS – a Final Analysis* http://h-online.com/-732971 (last accessed 12 April 2011); Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, *Cyber Incidents*.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nof the attack is information itself. Particularly, where the effect of the attack is not to destroy the information, but to degrade the information target to the extent that it cannot be relied upon. The effects of such an attack would obviously be dependent on the system that was under attack – for instance the consequences of degrading the information resident in an air traffic control system would obviously have a far more catastrophic effect than those of a stock exchange. The former would clearly be considered a use of force, while the latter is more likely to be considered an economic harm. Under the results-based theory, the fact that the attack on the air traffic control system results in serious harm and possible loss of life places it clearly within the purview of a use of force contrary to Article 2(4). However, the test promulgated by Brownlie also talks about damage to property. In both these circumstances the property that is damaged is intangible, vis a database. In the event that no loss of life occurs, the only damage which has occurred is to the information or data contained in the database. Is this sufficient property damage to satisfy Brownlie's test of a use of force? Note that under New Zealand and UK intellectual property law at least, the data contained in a database is not considered intellectual property. Therefore it cannot be the case that such damage on its own without further evidence of destruction is sufficient to fall foul of Article 2(4).\n\n## Weapons intangibility\n\nA second question that arises is whether a bitstream of malicious code is sufficiently militaristic or weapon-like to meet the required definition of 'armed' force. As seen above, Brownlie's theory of force also required a weapon, and computer network attacks do not conform to our traditional perception of weapons. However, Schmitt argues that the instrument-based distinction is a 'prescriptive shorthand' for a set of consequences which affect community values. Thus he argues:\n\nArmed coercion is not defined by whether or not kinetic energy is employed or released, but rather by the nature of the direct results caused, specifically physical damage and human injury. Instrumentalities that produce them are weapons. There is little debate about whether the use of chemicals or biological agents falls within the meaning of armed force, even though the means that cause the injury or death differ greatly from those produced by kinetic force.[131]\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n69\n\nThat is, a weapon is anything that directly causes physical damage and human injury. Jacobson has argued that ‘armed’ simply means equipped with weapons of war, and that weapons are tools designed to accomplish a specific mission.¹³² Brownlie’s approach was to fit the new technology to the definition. Given that a purely results-based approach does not provide the appropriate distinction between armed and other forms of coercion without reference to some other factors, those who adopt an instrument-based analysis argue the means of producing the results are still significant. That is, if a computer network attack does not meet some form of weapons criterion then it is likely that the use of such attack techniques will fall within the levels of coercion currently occupied by political and economic coercion. Where these attacks take place during an armed conflict, such acts will be seen as part of the ongoing conflict, and will be judged accordingly;¹³³ however, it is worth emphasising that, in this instance, these issues are raised in relation to the exercise of such force by an actor of the state before the commencement of traditional military action.\n\nThe definition of a weapon in the Oxford English Dictionary is a ‘thing designed, used, or usable for inflicting bodily harm’, or secondly, a ‘means for gaining advantage in a conflict’. While the first definition fits with a traditional use of kinetic violence, it is the second definition that may provide the answer for information warfare attacks. As seen above, however, it must be used with some caution as many tactics, which may gain an advantage in a conflict situation, would not be considered weapons. James Bond gives the example of spy satellites which pass over the territory of states and yet are not considered weapons and whose use is not considered a use of force.¹³⁴ He reaches this conclusion on the grounds that satellites merely process data rather than having a direct capability of producing death or physical destruction of property. Bond thus extrapolates this to other pieces of equipment which do nothing but process data, and concludes that most, if not nearly all, instances of data manipulation would not equate to employing a weapon and would not constitute the use of force.¹³⁵\n\n¹³² Mark Jacobson, ‘War in the Information Age: International Law, Self Defence and the Problem of “Non-Armed” Attacks’ (1998) 21(3) Journal of Strategic Studies 1.\n¹³³ For a discussion of the law of weaponry as it pertains to computer network attacks see Chapter 8 below.\n¹³⁴ Bond, Peacetime Foreign Data Manipulation, 83.\n¹³⁵ Ibid.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nHowever, the question of weapons intangibility is not helpful in determining whether new methods of warfare are uses of force prohibited under international law. An analogy with the domestic criminal law of murder is useful in this regard. Murder weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and what may be a permissible and useful tool in one regard, such as a wrench, for example, can be transformed into an instrument of death in an instant. The key factors that determine its use as a weapon is not the nature of the object itself, but rather how the object was used, against whom and why.[136]\n\nThe problem is compounded by a failure on the part of some commentators to distinguish between a particular piece of malicious code as a weapon and identifying the computer or network as a weapon. The weapon of choice for a computer network attack is a series of ones and zeros (a bitstream) which comprise a set of instructions; it may be simple (as in the case of a basic DDoS attack code), or it may be a sophisticated, multi-component piece of malware (such as the Stuxnet worm). A computer network attack is, therefore, perhaps a perfect example of the principles of domestic criminal law indicated above which interpret a weapon as something being used to injure persons or property. Thus in the example above, a wrench in the hands of a mechanic may be merely a tool of the trade or an instrument of destruction depending on his or her intent. The binary coding required for a computer network attack contains the instructions for the attack and hence represents an almost pure expression of the intent of the attacker.\n\n## 3.1.3. Locus\n\nAnother argument raised against computer network attacks as a use of force concerns the problem of the locus of the attack and the locus of the target. The locus of the attack was raised early on in the literature, with some commentators claiming there was no cross-border action involved in the attack.[137] However, this argument is ill founded. While a border violation may be evidence of a use of force, international law does not require cross-border action to occur before a use of force has been found. For example, an act against a visiting foreign minister or head of state of a country has always been considered an act of force\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n71\n\nby the host state.¹³⁸ Further, the actions of the United Kingdom in the Corfu Channel case were held to be a policy of force even though the strait concerned was of the ‘class of international highways through which passage cannot be prohibited’.¹³⁹\n\nThe main issue with the locus of the attack is that it can be very difficult to establish with any degree of certainty where the attack was actually generated. Current technology allows attackers to conceal their identity and route any attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. For example, the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ attacks, in which a number of US Department of Defense networks were compromised, appeared to be coming from multiple servers in the US as well as the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany and Taiwan. While this attack is purely a matter of transnational criminal law, the possibilities for a state-sponsored version of the same style of attack exist. The ‘Titan Rain’ series of intrusions routed stolen data through servers in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to computers in Guangdong province in mainland China.¹⁴⁰ Although most analysts believe the Chinese government to be behind the espionage attacks, China has denied all involvement and the attribution cannot be proved. From a law enforcement point of view it may be almost impossible to determine where the attack originated, and whether the attack was launched as the first blow in a conventional interstate conflict, terrorist attack, domestic crime or accident.¹⁴¹ DDoS attacks may be even more difficult to trace, as attacks come from multiple computers recruited to a botnet – tracing the controlling computer can be a time-consuming and difficult job. The attacks launched against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 are cases in point.\n\nOther scholars have taken issue with the fact that the target of any such attack is located in the information realm, i.e. cyberspace, and have argued that this area is not regulated by the current laws of armed\n\n¹³⁸ See, for example, the 1993 missile attacks launched by the US in response to an assassination attempt against former President George H.

    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nconflict.¹⁴² There are two possible answers to this argument, depending on the mode of the initial attack. The first answer to concerns over the locus of the target is a practical one. As discussed in Chapter 1 above, data does not exist in the ether of cyberspace; it must reside on a server that is actually present in the physical domain. Although the location for a target with military significance is likely to be hosted on a state's own systems, it is also possible that important functions could be located elsewhere, possibly even in a foreign state,¹⁴³ so while geographical boundaries are not important, the target is still embedded in a geographic location. This physical location has been the basis for international consensus on jurisdictional claims relating to cross-border cyber crime and electronic transactions, thus there is no reason the same approach would not be applied in respect of the international law on the use of force and humanitarian law.¹⁴⁴ The second answer is closely related to the following section on the results of computer network attacks which do not affect the physical sphere and is dealt with below.\n\n## 3.1.4. Result\n\nComputer network attacks incorporate many different techniques from simple denial of service to direct data or system manipulation and the possible results span the spectrum from mere inconvenience to catastrophic damage to life and property.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, the flexibility and wide range of possible results are two of the reasons that such weapons are attractive to the armed forces. However, the indeterminate result of a computer network attack is also the characteristic that causes the most uncertainty in applying the legal requirements of force and the laws of war.\n\nFirst, while a computer network attack may result in death or damage to physical property, it need not do so. The purpose of the attack may simply be to shut off a particular service or function; for example, shutting off a particular telecommunications system to force an opponent to use a more insecure method.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, the main\n\n¹⁴² See, for example, Kanuck, 'Information Warfare: New Challenges for Public International Law', 287.\n¹⁴³ For example, following their virtual declaration of independence in 1998, the website of East Timor was hosted on servers in the Republic of Ireland.\n¹⁴⁴ See, for example, the UN model laws on electronic commerce and computer crime.\n¹⁴⁵ For example, the 'Farewell Dossier' incident resulted in the 'most monumental non-nuclear explosion ever seen from space', Reed, At the Abyss, 269.\n¹⁴⁶ Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 888.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n73\n\npurpose of the computer network attack may be the denial, corruption or exploitation of the information target itself. For example, the Israeli attacks against the Syrian air defence radar system which allowed their fighters to remain undetected during their raid on a suspected nuclear facility in 2007.¹⁴⁷\n\nGiven the character of these attacks, should these results be dealt with in a legal manner in the same way as conventional uses of force, or should they fall into the category of other means of coercion? As the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated:¹⁴⁸\n\nInformation Warfare can make an important contribution to defusing crises; reducing the period of confrontation and enhancing the impact of informational, diplomatic and military efforts, and forestalling or eliminating the need to employ forces in a combat situation.\n\nIn terms of the prohibition against force, however, the Brownlie and Dinstein models of force require that the result of a use of force is fatality or damage to property; however, no analysis has been undertaken to determine whether such damage to property would include damage to intellectual or other intangible property. Of course, it has always been legitimate in warfare to steal or corrupt the opponent's information, supply them with disinformation and sabotage their weaponry as long as such acts do not constitute perfidy. However, this presupposes an armed conflict is already under way between the opposing states. Where such acts take place prior to the commencement of a traditional attack, the permissiveness of these acts in wartime may militate against the question of whether these acts cross the threshold of 'force' in peacetime. The current author considers that at the present time such incidents do not constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter. Needless to say, however, they may well still constitute unlawful interference in a state and retain the character of internationally wrongful acts invoking state responsibility for reparations.\n\n¹⁴⁷ See Appendix 1 for details of this attack. Fulghum and Barrie, 'Israel Used Electronic Attack in Air Strike against Syrian Mystery Target'; Fulghum, Wall and Butler, 'Israel Shows Electronic Prowess'. Although note that in that case most states would conclude that the network attack represented the start of the wider military operation and it would thus be judged in its entirety.\n\n¹⁴⁸ US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Information Warfare: A Strategy for Peace … The Decisive Edge in War (1996) 5, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA318379 (last accessed 5 July 2011), cited in Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 892.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "COMPUTER NETWORK ATTACKS AS A USE OF FORCE\n\nSecondly, one of the consequences of the interconnectivity of electronic resources is that military systems are often using, or are crosswired with, civilian networks so that without extensive network reconnaissance it is very hard to determine what the effects of any particular attack may be. For example, a recent speech by the US Director of National Intelligence estimated that 98 per cent of all US government communications traffic flowed over civilian networks.^[149]^ As well as posing a targeting dilemma, the problem becomes one of accurate mapping of the networks in order to determine what the consequences of each type of attack may be. An attack designed to electronically incapacitate a command and control centre and early warning systems may inadvertently disable critical equipment in a hospital connected via a node on a related network. The unpredictable nature of the results is one of the major problems in assessing the legality of this new form of warfare.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nThe present author considers that where a computer network attack, directly or indirectly, results in a physical consequence, namely destruction of physical property, injury or loss of lives, it will constitute a use of force under Article 2(4). This appears to be clear from interpretation of the relevant legal instruments despite the intangibility of the weapon used; as seen from the discussion above, the weapon criteria is losing its relevancy in today's world. However, where the result of a computer network attack does not manifest itself in the physical sphere (that is, it affects information only), or its physical results are too minimal or too removed from the chain of causation (i.e. the results were not a foreseeable consequence of the act), the attack does not fall clearly within the traditional test for Article 2(4) and will not constitute a use of force. The fact that a computer network attack does not rise to the level of a use of force does not imply that it is therefore permissible. It is likely that any computer network attack severe enough to raise this question will be considered an unlawful interference in the affairs of a state, and may in all likelihood amount to a threat to the peace.\n\n^[149]^ Michael McConnell, Keynote Address at the Texas Law Review Symposium: Law at the Intersection of National Security, Privacy and Technology, 4 February 2010 cited in Eric Jensen, 'Cyber Warfare and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks' (2010) 88 Tex.
