Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force”¹ and “uses of cyber coercion”².\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945³ and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n¹ The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n² Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n³ Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n87\nPact is needed because the face of belligerence is changing and incidents such as the Sony Picture cyber operation are arising with greater frequency. The article will conclude by emphasising that cyber structural fragility, coupled with the international community's event-centric attitude to the creation of international law, dangerously cultivates the perfect environment for an event that has the capability to be destructive.\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain.⁴ Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\".⁵ In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war.⁶ The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum⁷ and the jus in bello⁸ are regulated.⁹ The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s.¹⁰ At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state.¹¹ The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.¹²\n⁴ \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n⁵ Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n⁶ Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n⁷ Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n⁸ Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n⁹ Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n¹⁰ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n¹¹ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n¹² Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law.¹³ The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\"¹⁴ in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009.¹⁵ The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\"¹⁶ Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\"¹⁷ The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.¹⁸\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence.¹⁹ Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.²⁰\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\".²¹ There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\"²² which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n¹³ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁴ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁵ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁶ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁷ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n¹⁸ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n¹⁹ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²⁰ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²¹ Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n²² Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n89\ndiscourse and removing the need for a rhetoric such as \"cyber war\" in the legal lexicon of a nascent branch of international law.\nThe Hague Conventions²³, the Geneva Conventions²⁴, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war.²⁵ According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE], \"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\"²⁶ Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly \"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\"²⁷ However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations.²⁸ Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this \"normative ambiguity.\"²⁹\nInternational law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace.³⁰ Schreier contends that cyber force has been \"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\",³¹ however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force.³² This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to \"return to the basic building blocks of international law\"³³ and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.\n## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?\nIt is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be\n23 The Hague Convention 1899 and The Hague Convention 1907\n24 The Geneva Convention 1929 and The Geneva Convention 1949\n25 Lieutenant Colonel Scott W.

In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹\n³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n³⁷ Guyana v.

Reports 1996, p. 226, International Court of Justice, 8 July 1996—in which, the ICJ stated that there is an equivalence of treatment between the use of force and the threat of force. Essentially the Court stated that if the use of force in a particular case is illegal, then the threat of force will also be illegal.\n⁴⁰ Michael N. Schmitt, “The Law of Cyber Warfare: Quo Vadis?” (2014) 25 S.L.P.R. 256\n⁴¹ Yoram Dinstein, *War, Aggression and Self Defence*, 5th Edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n91\n# Armed Force Alone\nThe normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force.⁴² However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force.⁴³ Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion.⁴⁴ If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”⁴⁵ as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.⁴⁶\nFor art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met”⁴⁷ namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.⁴⁸\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure.⁴⁹ The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n⁴² Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴³ Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n⁴⁴ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n⁴⁵ UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n⁴⁶ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴⁷ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁸ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93\nADEO FRASER\nuse of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force.⁵⁰ There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces”⁵¹ irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel.⁵² Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction.⁵³ Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon.⁵⁴ In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.”⁵⁵ States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.”⁵⁶ This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”⁵⁷\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack.⁵⁸ The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n⁵⁰ Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n⁵¹ Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n⁵² Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n⁵³ Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n⁵⁴ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n⁵⁵ *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n⁵⁶ James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n⁵⁷ Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n⁵⁸ Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n93\n2(4) prohibition on the use of inter-state force, and recognises the importance of reporting threats to international peace and security to the Security Council before those threats materialise.59 However, one could argue that the literalists suffer from selective literalism as art. 51 refers to the \"inherent right of self-defence\".60\nThe inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67\n59 Ashley S Deeks, “Taming the Doctrine of Pre-Emption” in Marc Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 664\n60 Article 51 of The Charter of the United Nations 1945\n61 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA), Merits, Judgment, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986 [hereinafter Nicaragua] 216, para. 228; Nicaragua v USA ICJ [1983] p. 94; Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 191\n62 Nicaragua, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel pp. 615, 227\n63 Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 196\n64 Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force By States (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1963), p. 278\n65 Phillip Jessup, A Modern Law of Nations (Hamden, CT: Archon Books 1968), p. 166\n66 Louis Henkin, International Law: Politics, Values and Functions (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff 1990), p. 156\n67 Brownlie, supra note 64, p. 278; Henkin, supra note 66, p. 156; Jessup, supra note 65, p. 166; Case Concerning the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo [2005] ICJ Rep 168, pp. 223–224; Eritrea Ethiopia Claims Commission Partial Award, Jus ad Bellum, 19 December 2005, Vol. XXVI, p. 433; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America, ICJ, 6 November 2003, p. 189; and the Nicaragua case.\nADEO FRASER\nArt. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour\nArt. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nthe authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰\nStuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77\nADEO FRASER\nof the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80\n## Economic Cyber Operation\nThe Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82\nIn 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n79 Jonathan Fildes, “Stuxnet Work ‘Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets’” BBC News 23 September 2010 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018 [Accessed 20 June 2012]\n80 Mary Ellen O’Connell, “Cyber Security Without Cyber War” 17 (2012) J.L.C. p. 201; Louise Arimatsu, “Classifying Cyber Warfare” in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchanan (ed.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015) p. 330; Schmitt, supra note 26, s. 13 rule 15\n81 Jaak Aaviksoo, “Cyberattacks Against Estonia Raised Awareness of Cyberthreats” (2010) 3 D.A.T.R. pp. 13–22\n82 Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n83 Katherine Hinkle, “Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry About” (2011) 37 Y.J.I.L 11, pp. 13–14\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n97\nof essential resources. $^{84}$ In any event, the disruptive cyber operations on Estonia did not result in material damage or significant disruption, and therefore cannot be regarded as a cyber use of force. $^{85}$ Even though the Estonian cyber operation may not have reached the use of force threshold, it was an unlawful cyber intervention and thus, a use of cyber coercion. $^{86}$\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\n84 US Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-20 (October 2012), p. 3; Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 55, 62\n85 Roscini, supra note 37, p. 63\n86 Buchanan, supra note 49, pp. 211–215; For an additional example of see Operation Ababil – Ellen Nakashima, “Iran Blamed for Cyberattacks on U.S. Banks and Companies” Washington Post, 21 September 2012 http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/ 2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Emilio Iasiello, “Cyber Attack: A Dull tool to Shape Foreign Policy” in K Podins, J Stinissen and M Maybaum (ed) 5th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (Tallinn: NATO CCD COE, 2013), pp. 11–14\n87 Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 65–66\n88 U.S. Office of Personnel Management, “Information About OPM Cybersecurity Incidents” (2015) http://www.opm.gov/cybersecurity [Accessed 29 August 2015]; Andrew Griffin, “The US has been hit by the biggest hack in its history—and nobody knows who did it” The Independent, 10 July 2015 http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/opm-hack-21-million-peoples-sensitive-details-stolen-in-biggest-cyberattack-in-us-history-10379592.html [Accessed 29 August 2015]\n89 Ira Winkler, “Guard Against Titan Rain Hackers” Computerworld 20 Oct 2005 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2559195/security0/guard-against-titan-rain-hackers.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Nathan Thornburgh, “Inside The Chinese Hack Attack” Time Aug 25 2005 http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1098371,00.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Richard Norton-Taylor, “Titan Rain – How Chinese Hackers Targeted Whitehall” The Guardian 5 September 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/04/news.internet [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n90 Roscini, supra note 37, p. 65\n91 Herbet Lin, “Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force” (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law &amp; Policy 64\nADEO FRASER\n## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack\nIn 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor.⁹² The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries.⁹³ Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.⁹⁴\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004,⁹⁵ the German Military Manual,⁹⁶ and the 1997 US President's certification⁹⁷ evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\"⁹⁸ States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\".⁹⁹ In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n⁹² Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n⁹³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n⁹⁴ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n⁹⁵ “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n⁹⁶ German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n⁹⁷ Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n⁹⁸ “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n⁹⁹ ibid, pp. 26–27\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n99\nhave been entitled to respond to the cyber uses of force with military force. The term “cyber war” therefore fails to appreciate the fact that cyber operations must reach a “certain level of intensity” in order to trigger an armed conflict. The failure of international law to effectively regulate low intensity cyber operations is fostering a culture, rather a cyber shadow, in which states seek to use cyber operations as an instrument of national policy.\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰⁰ came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace”¹⁰¹ as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.”¹⁰² Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation”¹⁰³ of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN¹⁰⁴, US¹⁰⁵, UK¹⁰⁶, Russian Federation¹⁰⁷ and China¹⁰⁸ have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.¹⁰⁹\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n¹⁰⁰ Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n¹⁰¹ Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰² Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰³ Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n¹⁰⁴ UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n¹⁰⁵ CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n¹⁰⁶ UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n¹⁰⁷ Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n¹⁰⁸ Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n¹⁰⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold.¹¹⁰ Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.”¹¹¹ There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.¹¹²\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.”¹¹³ The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II. Can These Various Forms of Cyber Activity be Brought within the Paradigm of Force, or is International Law Waiting for a Cyber Disaster?\n## The Changing Face of Belligerence¹¹⁴\nThe evolution of belligerence has been predicated upon societal advancements and technological innovation.

Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold.¹²¹ The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force. Failure to do so will only lead to greater uncertainty,\n¹¹⁵ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 1; William J Lynn III, Remarks on the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, As Delivered by Deputy Secretary of Defense (14 July 2011) http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1593 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n¹¹⁶ The Economist, supra note 4\n¹¹⁷ Tom Whitehead, Ben Riley Smith and Rosa Prince, \"British Army Could be Cut to Just 50,000 Over Next Four Years, Report Warns\" The Telegraph 9 March 2015 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11449136/British-Army-could-be-cut-to-just-50000-over-next-four-years-report-warns.html [Accessed 28 July 2015]; Richard Norton-Taylor, \"UK Ministers Turn on Critics of Defence Cuts\" The Guardian 22 June 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/jun/22/uk-ministers-turn-on-critics-of-defence-cuts [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n¹¹⁸ Benjamin D Katz, \"Army Cuts Pose Threat to Tank, Gunmakers as Ground Wars Recede\" Bloomberg Business 7 July 2015 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/army-cuts-pose-threat-to-tank-gunmakers-as-ground-wars-recede [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n¹¹⁹ Kiran Stacey, \"US General Warns UK of Danger of Putting Technology over Manpower\" The Financial Times, 30 June 2015; Fleur Johns, Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011) pp. 15, 7-8\n¹²⁰ Norton-Taylor, supra note 117\n¹²¹ David Painter, The Cold War: An International History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 44-69, 71-78; Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld, Cyber Warfare: Techniques, Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners (Oxford: Elsevier, 2013) pp. 7-8\nADEO FRASER\nand incidents like the “Sony Pictures v North Korea” cyber operation arising with greater frequency. The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.”¹²² The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.”¹²³ The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie.¹²⁴ Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force.¹³² For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war.¹³³ However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.”¹³⁴ The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them.¹³⁵ The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future.¹³⁶ In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n¹³² Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³³ Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³⁴ Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹³⁵ Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n¹³⁶ Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n105\nto reasonably conclude that the government of North Korea was responsible for the Sony Pictures cyber operation.¹³⁷ The Guardians of Peace were deployed by the military's General Bureau of Reconnaissance, who are state \"organs\"; consequently the hackers' actions are attributable to North Korea even if the hackers were acting beyond the scope of their authority.¹³⁸ In this instance, the US did not have the right to self-defence as the cyber operation was a use of cyber coercion that failed to reach the armed attack threshold. However, the US would have been entitled to respond to the violation of its sovereignty.\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation.¹³⁹ The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce.\"¹⁴⁰ Hence, it is evident that international law provides a wide range of possible response options to states that have fallen victim to malicious cyber operations.\nStates that fall victim to cyber operations that amount to internationally wrongful acts are entitled to engage in \"countermeasures\" providing that they can prove \"(1) breach of an international obligation owed to another State, and (2) attributability of the wrongful act to the State in question.\"¹⁴¹ Countermeasures provide states with a useful legal framework through which actions that would otherwise be unlawful, are legitimately used by an injured state to persuade a wrongdoing state to comply with international law.¹⁴² Countermeasures are solely available against states, and the predominant view is that they may not reach the level of a use of force but must be commensurate to the injury suffered.¹⁴³ Countermeasures, be they cyber or non-cyber, have been recognised by the ICJ and arbitral tribunals as being permissible providing that the requisite conditions have been met, and that there is full compliance with the law governing them.¹⁴⁴\n¹³⁷ Stephan Haggard and Jon R.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures.¹⁴⁵ The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge.¹⁴⁶ The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility¹⁴⁷ indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations.¹⁴⁸ However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\"¹⁴⁹ Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.¹⁵⁰ Unilateral\net Avant que le Portugal ne Participât à la Guerre (Port. v.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated.¹⁵⁵ Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.¹⁵⁶\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response.¹⁵⁹ Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.”¹⁶⁰ The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.”¹⁶¹ This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive”¹⁶² attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative”¹⁶⁵ to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being”¹⁶⁶ and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development.¹⁶⁷ International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order.¹⁶⁸ The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.¹⁶⁹\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.”¹⁷⁰ The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.¹⁷¹ The event\n¹⁶³ Eichensehr, supra note 157\n¹⁶⁴ Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n¹⁶⁵ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁶ Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n¹⁶⁷ Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n¹⁶⁸ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁹ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n¹⁷⁰ Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n¹⁷¹ Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41\nADEO FRASER\nis disavowed in international law for a policy of prevention and containment and a correspondent scientific evaluation of all anticipated outcomes. However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”.¹⁷² This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.¹⁷³\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.”¹⁷⁴ A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history.¹⁷⁵ For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space”¹⁷⁶ for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.”¹⁷⁷ Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force.

However, the reality of the cyber landscape is that there are a plethora of alternative cyber options available to states that international law has failed to pay attention to. A cause for concern is that a lack of substantive regulation has enabled states to develop their cyber capabilities and provided an ideal climate for cyber uses of force to become more destructive over time. Stuxnet is testament to this fact. International law must develop a technique, standard or tool capable of enabling the \"correctness\" or legitimacy of cyber operations to be determined decisively.¹⁷⁹ \"A mystified opposition between a primitive past and an advanced present/future becomes the interpretative device for understanding doctrinal progress (correctness, determinacy, social relevance)\",¹⁸⁰ cyber progress for international law will only be achieved through a transition from \"fragmentation to standardization\",¹⁸¹ from \"academic formalism to pragmatism\"¹⁸² and from politics to process.\nIt appears futile to condemn cyber conflict, or attempt to eradicate the inevitable transition into this period's peculiar form of war. Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\"¹⁸³ Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle.¹⁸⁴ The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law.¹⁸⁵ International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n¹⁷⁹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n¹⁸⁰ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n¹⁸¹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸² Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸³ Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n¹⁸⁴ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n¹⁸⁵ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\nADEO FRASER\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war.¹⁸⁶ However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event.¹⁸⁷ A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force. President Barack Obama has already indicated his intention for the US to\n¹⁸⁶ Dinstein, *supra* note 41, pp. 84–87\n¹⁸⁷ Chantal Mouffe, “Schmitte’s Vision of Multipolar World Order” (2005) 104 S.A.Q 248\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n113\nbecome much more aggressive in cyber space.¹⁸⁸ One can only wonder what a cyber operation much more aggressive than Stuxnet would look like. The international community needs to recognise that the face of belligerence is changing; instead of allowing cyber operations to increase in their severity over time, the international community must facilitate the creation of a new cyber orientated legal framework. The name and shame culture that the US appears to be developing may well be one of the first steps towards regulating inter-state uses of cyber force and bringing cyberspace into the paradigm of force.\n¹⁸⁸ President Barack Obama, “Remarks by President Obama in Press Conference after G7 Summit” (8 June 2015) http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/08/remarks-president-obama-press-conference-after-g7-summit [Accessed 9 September 2015]",

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force” and “uses of cyber coercion”.\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945 and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain. Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\". In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war. The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello are regulated. The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s. At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state. The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.\n \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law. The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\" in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009. The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\" Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\" The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence. Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\". There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\" which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war. According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE], \"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\" Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly \"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\" However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations. Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this \"normative ambiguity.\"\nInternational law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace. Schreier contends that cyber force has been \"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\", however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force. This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to \"return to the basic building blocks of international law\" and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.\n## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?\nIt is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be\n\nADEO FRASER\nquestioned by considering that: cyberspace renders the threat of force rule obsolete; the underlying purpose of art. 2(4) was to regulate armed force alone; and there have not been sufficient developments in state practice to indicate that States have implicitly or explicitly accepted an expansion to art. 2(4) beyond mere armed force.\n## No Threats in Cyberspace\nArt. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.” The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.” Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable. Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion. The equivalence doctrine therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete. The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.\n Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n Guyana v.

Essentially the Court stated that if the use of force in a particular case is illegal, then the threat of force will also be illegal.\n Michael N. Schmitt, “The Law of Cyber Warfare: Quo Vadis?” (2014) 25 S.L.P.R. 256\n Yoram Dinstein, *War, Aggression and Self Defence*, 5th Edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force. However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force. Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion. If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.\nFor art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met” namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure. The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93\nADEO FRASER\nuse of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force. There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces” irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel. Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction. Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon. In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.” States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.” This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack. The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67\n\nADEO FRASER\nArt. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour\nArt. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia. No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold. However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nthe authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.\nStuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer” that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level” because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges” the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code” was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran. Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran. Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.” Some members of the International Group of Experts were\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77\nADEO FRASER\nof the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80\n## Economic Cyber Operation\nThe Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82\nIn 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\n\nADEO FRASER\n## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack\nIn 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor. The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries. Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004, the German Military Manual, and the 1997 US President's certification evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\" States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\". In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n ibid, pp. 26–27\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace” as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.” Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation” of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN, US, UK, Russian Federation and China have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold. Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.” There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.” The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II. Can These Various Forms of Cyber Activity be Brought within the Paradigm of Force, or is International Law Waiting for a Cyber Disaster?\n## The Changing Face of Belligerence\nThe evolution of belligerence has been predicated upon societal advancements and technological innovation.

We live in a world where drones are flown remotely across the world, bombs use GPS satellites to strike their targets, and warships and fighter planes are now vast data-processing centres. Technological innovation has combined with austerity measures to create a post-Iraq war political environment that finds states downsizing their conventional military forces and exploring more technologically advanced measures. Consequently, conventional military technology such as the tank is being rendered increasingly obsolete, whilst drone strikes are on the verge of becoming the cornerstone of western military foreign policy. Some critics have warned of the potential dangers of choosing technology in the apparent dichotomy between technology and manpower. However, state security is no longer a case of which state has the largest military force but rather a question of \"smart power\"; in other words, which state has the best regular and irregular defence mechanisms to resist both orthodox and unorthodox military operations.\nThe Cold War centred on the playing out of tensions and the expansion of spheres of influence. Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold. The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force. Failure to do so will only lead to greater uncertainty,\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 1; William J Lynn III, Remarks on the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, As Delivered by Deputy Secretary of Defense (14 July 2011) http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1593 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n The Economist, supra note 4\n Tom Whitehead, Ben Riley Smith and Rosa Prince, \"British Army Could be Cut to Just 50,000 Over Next Four Years, Report Warns\" The Telegraph 9 March 2015 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11449136/British-Army-could-be-cut-to-just-50000-over-next-four-years-report-warns.html [Accessed 28 July 2015]; Richard Norton-Taylor, \"UK Ministers Turn on Critics of Defence Cuts\" The Guardian 22 June 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/jun/22/uk-ministers-turn-on-critics-of-defence-cuts [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Benjamin D Katz, \"Army Cuts Pose Threat to Tank, Gunmakers as Ground Wars Recede\" Bloomberg Business 7 July 2015 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/army-cuts-pose-threat-to-tank-gunmakers-as-ground-wars-recede [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Kiran Stacey, \"US General Warns UK of Danger of Putting Technology over Manpower\" The Financial Times, 30 June 2015; Fleur Johns, Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011) pp. 15, 7-8\n Norton-Taylor, supra note 117\n David Painter, The Cold War: An International History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 44-69, 71-78; Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld, Cyber Warfare: Techniques, Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners (Oxford: Elsevier, 2013) pp. 7-8\nADEO FRASER\nand incidents like the “Sony Pictures v North Korea” cyber operation arising with greater frequency. The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.” The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.” The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie. Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”. According to official FBI reports, North Korea ordered a group of covert cyber warriors under the moniker of the “Guardians of Peace”, but purported to be members of the Bureau 121 hacking unit, to retaliate by performing an offensive cyber operation on Sony Picture’s IT system.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force. For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war. However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.” The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them. The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future. In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n Schmitt, supra note 126\n Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation. The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce.\" Hence, it is evident that international law provides a wide range of possible response options to states that have fallen victim to malicious cyber operations.\nStates that fall victim to cyber operations that amount to internationally wrongful acts are entitled to engage in \"countermeasures\" providing that they can prove \"(1) breach of an international obligation owed to another State, and (2) attributability of the wrongful act to the State in question.\" Countermeasures provide states with a useful legal framework through which actions that would otherwise be unlawful, are legitimately used by an injured state to persuade a wrongdoing state to comply with international law. Countermeasures are solely available against states, and the predominant view is that they may not reach the level of a use of force but must be commensurate to the injury suffered. Countermeasures, be they cyber or non-cyber, have been recognised by the ICJ and arbitral tribunals as being permissible providing that the requisite conditions have been met, and that there is full compliance with the law governing them.\n Stephan Haggard and Jon R.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures. The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations. However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\" Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated. Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Several US Army officials have also stressed their views that conventional military force may be used in response to malicious cyber operations. From Gen. Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response. Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.” The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.” This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive” attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative” to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being” and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development. International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order. The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.” The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.

However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”. This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.” A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history. For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space” for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.” Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force. Paving the way for, what Minkkinen would describe as “correctness”, pragmatically motivated decisions and judgments.\n---\n *ibid*\n *ibid*\n Ruth M.

Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\" Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle. The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law. International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\nADEO FRASER\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war. However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event. A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force.

      "## No Threats in Cyberspace Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.”³⁴ The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.”³⁵ Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷ However, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹ ³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007) ³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations ³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15 ³⁷ Guyana v.

      "## Types of Cyber Activity The term\"cyber war\"completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike."

      "## Physical Cyber Operation The\"Original Logic Bomb\"is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove ⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18 ⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012) From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard the authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰ Stuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵ The Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18 ⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10 ⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208 ⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31 ⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32 ⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42 ⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv ⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77 ADEO FRASER of the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80 ## Economic Cyber Operation The Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82 In 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that\"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"The cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability"

      "## Conclusion Cyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force."

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force”¹ and “uses of cyber coercion”².\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945³ and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand ¹ The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force ² Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n³ Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard",
    "## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?": "### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain.⁴ Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\".⁵ In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war.⁶ The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum⁷ and the jus in bello⁸ are regulated.⁹ The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s.¹⁰ At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state.¹¹ The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.¹²\n⁴ \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n⁵ Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n⁶ Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n⁷ Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n⁸ Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n⁹ Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n¹⁰ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n¹¹ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n¹² Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law.¹³ The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\"¹⁴ in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009.¹⁵ The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\"¹⁶ Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\"¹⁷ The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.¹⁸\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence.¹⁹ Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.²⁰\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\".²¹ There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\"²² which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n¹³ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁴ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁵ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁶ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁷ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n¹⁸ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n¹⁹ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²⁰ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²¹ Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n²² Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nThe Hague Conventions²³, the Geneva Conventions²⁴, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war.²⁵ According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE],\"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\"²⁶ Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly\"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\"²⁷ However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations.²⁸ Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this\"normative ambiguity.\"²⁹ International law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace.³⁰ Schreier contends that cyber force has been\"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\",³¹ however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force.³² This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to\"return to the basic building blocks of international law\"³³ and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.",
    "## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?": "It is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be ADEO FRASER questioned by considering that: cyberspace renders the threat of force rule obsolete; the underlying purpose of art. 2(4) was to regulate armed force alone; and there have not been sufficient developments in state practice to indicate that States have implicitly or explicitly accepted an expansion to art. 2(4) beyond mere armed force.",
    "## No Threats in Cyberspace Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.”³⁴ The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.”³⁵ Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷ However, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹ ³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007) ³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations ³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15 ³⁷ Guyana v.

Essentially the Court stated that if the use of force in a particular case is illegal, then the threat of force will also be illegal.": "⁴⁰ Michael N. Schmitt, “The Law of Cyber Warfare: Quo Vadis?” (2014) 25 S.L.P.R. 256 ⁴¹ Yoram Dinstein, *War, Aggression and Self Defence*, 5th Edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 191 From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard The normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force.⁴² However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force.⁴³ Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion.⁴⁴ If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”⁴⁵ as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.⁴⁶ For art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met”⁴⁷ namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.⁴⁸ Cyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure.⁴⁹ The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the ⁴² Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45 ⁴³ Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion ⁴⁴ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129 ⁴⁵ UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff ⁴⁶ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45 ⁴⁷ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44 ⁴⁸ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44 ⁴⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93 ADEO FRASER use of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force.⁵⁰ There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces”⁵¹ irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel.⁵² Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction.⁵³ Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon.⁵⁴ In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.”⁵⁵ States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.”⁵⁶ This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”⁵⁷ ## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4) In order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack.⁵⁸ The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n⁵⁰ Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611 ⁵¹ Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23 ⁵² Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1 ⁵³ Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69 ⁵⁴ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50 ⁵⁵ *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39 ⁵⁶ James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015] ⁵⁷ Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280 ⁵⁸ Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191 From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard The inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term\"inherent right\"is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51: [t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62 Schwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67 ADEO FRASER Art. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour Art. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.",
    "## Types of Cyber Activity The term\"cyber war\"completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.": "",
    "## Physical Cyber Operation The\"Original Logic Bomb\"is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove ⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18 ⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012) From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard the authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰ Stuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵ The Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18 ⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10 ⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208 ⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31 ⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32 ⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42 ⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv ⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77 ADEO FRASER of the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80 ## Economic Cyber Operation The Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82 In 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that\"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"The cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability": "From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard",
    "## Information Orientated Cyber Operation": "Information orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\nADEO FRASER ## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack In 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor.⁹² The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries.⁹³ Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.⁹⁴ ## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality State practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004,⁹⁵ the German Military Manual,⁹⁶ and the 1997 US President's certification⁹⁷ evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements\"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\"⁹⁸ States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as\"border clashes\",\"skirmishes\"and\"incidents\".⁹⁹ In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates\"most grave\"cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well ⁹² Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43 ⁹³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 34 ⁹⁴ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107 ⁹⁵ “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015] ⁹⁶ German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214 ⁹⁷ Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015] ⁹⁸ “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3 ⁹⁹ ibid, pp. 26–27 From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard",

    "## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework": "There is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰⁰ came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace”¹⁰¹ as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.”¹⁰² Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation”¹⁰³ of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN¹⁰⁴, US¹⁰⁵, UK¹⁰⁶, Russian Federation¹⁰⁷ and China¹⁰⁸ have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.¹⁰⁹\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n¹⁰⁰ Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n¹⁰¹ Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰² Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰³ Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n¹⁰⁴ UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n¹⁰⁵ CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n¹⁰⁶ UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n¹⁰⁷ Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n¹⁰⁸ Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n¹⁰⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold.¹¹⁰ Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.”¹¹¹ There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.¹¹²\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.”¹¹³ The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.",

Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold.¹²¹ The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also.

    "## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty": "The Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.”¹²³ The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie.¹²⁴ Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force.¹³² For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war.¹³³ However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.”¹³⁴ The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them.¹³⁵ The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future.¹³⁶ In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n¹³² Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³³ Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³⁴ Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹³⁵ Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n¹³⁶ Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard",

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures.¹⁴⁵ The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge.¹⁴⁶ The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility¹⁴⁷ indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations.¹⁴⁸ However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\"¹⁴⁹ Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.¹⁵⁰ Unilateral\net Avant que le Portugal ne Participât à la Guerre (Port. v.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated.¹⁵⁵ Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.¹⁵⁶ NATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber Marossi and Marisa R.

Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response.¹⁵⁹ Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.”¹⁶⁰ The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects... That’s not necessarily the case.”¹⁶¹ This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive”¹⁶² attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative”¹⁶⁵ to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being”¹⁶⁶ and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development.¹⁶⁷ International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order.¹⁶⁸ The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.¹⁶⁹\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.”¹⁷⁰ The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.¹⁷¹ The event\n¹⁶³ Eichensehr, supra note 157\n¹⁶⁴ Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n¹⁶⁵ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁶ Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n¹⁶⁷ Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n¹⁶⁸ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁹ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n¹⁷⁰ Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n¹⁷¹ Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41\nADEO FRASER\nis disavowed in international law for a policy of prevention and containment and a correspondent scientific evaluation of all anticipated outcomes. However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”.¹⁷² This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.¹⁷³\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.”¹⁷⁴ A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.",
    "## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact": "“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history.¹⁷⁵ For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space”¹⁷⁶ for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.”¹⁷⁷ Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force.

Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the\"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied\"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\"¹⁸³ Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle.¹⁸⁴ The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law.¹⁸⁵ International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n¹⁷⁹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75 ¹⁸⁰ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78 ¹⁸¹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77 ¹⁸² Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77 ¹⁸³ Arnold D McNair,\"Collective Security\"(1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155 ¹⁸⁴ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84 ¹⁸⁵ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84 ADEO FRASER Admittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war.¹⁸⁶ However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event.¹⁸⁷ A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.",
    "## Conclusion Cyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.": "The Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt.

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force” and “uses of cyber coercion”.\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945 and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain. Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\". In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war. The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello are regulated. The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s. At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state. The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.\n \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law. The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\" in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009. The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\" Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\" The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence. Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\". There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\" which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war. According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE], \"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\" Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly \"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\" However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations. Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this \"normative ambiguity.\"\nInternational law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace. Schreier contends that cyber force has been \"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\", however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force. This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to \"return to the basic building blocks of international law\" and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.\n## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?\nIt is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be\n\nADEO FRASER\nquestioned by considering that: cyberspace renders the threat of force rule obsolete; the underlying purpose of art. 2(4) was to regulate armed force alone; and there have not been sufficient developments in state practice to indicate that States have implicitly or explicitly accepted an expansion to art. 2(4) beyond mere armed force.\n## No Threats in Cyberspace\nArt. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.” The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.” Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable. Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion. The equivalence doctrine therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete. The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.\n Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n Guyana v.

However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force. Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion. If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.\nFor art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met” namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure. The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93\nADEO FRASER\nuse of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force. There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces” irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel. Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction. Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon. In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.” States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.” This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack. The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67\n\nADEO FRASER\nArt. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour\nArt. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia. No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold. However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nthe authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.\nStuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer” that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level” because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges” the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code” was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran. Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran. Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.” Some members of the International Group of Experts were\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77\nADEO FRASER\nof the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80\n## Economic Cyber Operation\nThe Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82\nIn 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\n\nADEO FRASER\n## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack\nIn 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor. The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries. Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004, the German Military Manual, and the 1997 US President's certification evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\" States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\". In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n ibid, pp. 26–27\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace” as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.” Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation” of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN, US, UK, Russian Federation and China have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold. Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.” There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.” The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II.

We live in a world where drones are flown remotely across the world, bombs use GPS satellites to strike their targets, and warships and fighter planes are now vast data-processing centres. Technological innovation has combined with austerity measures to create a post-Iraq war political environment that finds states downsizing their conventional military forces and exploring more technologically advanced measures. Consequently, conventional military technology such as the tank is being rendered increasingly obsolete, whilst drone strikes are on the verge of becoming the cornerstone of western military foreign policy. Some critics have warned of the potential dangers of choosing technology in the apparent dichotomy between technology and manpower. However, state security is no longer a case of which state has the largest military force but rather a question of \"smart power\"; in other words, which state has the best regular and irregular defence mechanisms to resist both orthodox and unorthodox military operations.\nThe Cold War centred on the playing out of tensions and the expansion of spheres of influence. Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold. The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force. Failure to do so will only lead to greater uncertainty,\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 1; William J Lynn III, Remarks on the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, As Delivered by Deputy Secretary of Defense (14 July 2011) http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1593 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n The Economist, supra note 4\n Tom Whitehead, Ben Riley Smith and Rosa Prince, \"British Army Could be Cut to Just 50,000 Over Next Four Years, Report Warns\" The Telegraph 9 March 2015 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11449136/British-Army-could-be-cut-to-just-50000-over-next-four-years-report-warns.html [Accessed 28 July 2015]; Richard Norton-Taylor, \"UK Ministers Turn on Critics of Defence Cuts\" The Guardian 22 June 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/jun/22/uk-ministers-turn-on-critics-of-defence-cuts [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Benjamin D Katz, \"Army Cuts Pose Threat to Tank, Gunmakers as Ground Wars Recede\" Bloomberg Business 7 July 2015 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/army-cuts-pose-threat-to-tank-gunmakers-as-ground-wars-recede [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Kiran Stacey, \"US General Warns UK of Danger of Putting Technology over Manpower\" The Financial Times, 30 June 2015; Fleur Johns, Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011) pp. 15, 7-8\n Norton-Taylor, supra note 117\n David Painter, The Cold War: An International History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 44-69, 71-78; Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld, Cyber Warfare: Techniques, Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners (Oxford: Elsevier, 2013) pp. 7-8\nADEO FRASER\nand incidents like the “Sony Pictures v North Korea” cyber operation arising with greater frequency. The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.” The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.” The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie. Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”. According to official FBI reports, North Korea ordered a group of covert cyber warriors under the moniker of the “Guardians of Peace”, but purported to be members of the Bureau 121 hacking unit, to retaliate by performing an offensive cyber operation on Sony Picture’s IT system.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force. For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war. However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.” The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them. The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future. In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n Schmitt, supra note 126\n Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation. The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce.\" Hence, it is evident that international law provides a wide range of possible response options to states that have fallen victim to malicious cyber operations.\nStates that fall victim to cyber operations that amount to internationally wrongful acts are entitled to engage in \"countermeasures\" providing that they can prove \"(1) breach of an international obligation owed to another State, and (2) attributability of the wrongful act to the State in question.\" Countermeasures provide states with a useful legal framework through which actions that would otherwise be unlawful, are legitimately used by an injured state to persuade a wrongdoing state to comply with international law. Countermeasures are solely available against states, and the predominant view is that they may not reach the level of a use of force but must be commensurate to the injury suffered. Countermeasures, be they cyber or non-cyber, have been recognised by the ICJ and arbitral tribunals as being permissible providing that the requisite conditions have been met, and that there is full compliance with the law governing them.\n Stephan Haggard and Jon R.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures. The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations. However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\" Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated. Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Several US Army officials have also stressed their views that conventional military force may be used in response to malicious cyber operations. From Gen. Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response. Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.” The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.” This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive” attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative” to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being” and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development. International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order. The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.” The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.

However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”. This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.” A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history. For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space” for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.” Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force.

Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\" Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle. The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law. International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\nADEO FRASER\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war. However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event. A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force.

Stuxnet is testament to this fact. International law must develop a technique, standard or tool capable of enabling the \"correctness\" or legitimacy of cyber operations to be determined decisively.¹⁷⁹ \"A mystified opposition between a primitive past and an advanced present/future becomes the interpretative device for understanding doctrinal progress (correctness, determinacy, social relevance)\",¹⁸⁰ cyber progress for international law will only be achieved through a transition from \"fragmentation to standardization\",¹⁸¹ from \"academic formalism to pragmatism\"¹⁸² and from politics to process.",

          "footnote": "The international legal regulation of cyber force solely addresses cyber operations that amount to an armed attack and cause significant destruction. However, the reality of the cyber landscape is that there are a plethora of alternative cyber options available to states that international law has failed to pay attention to. A cause for concern is that a lack of substantive regulation has enabled states to develop their cyber capabilities and provided an ideal climate for cyber uses of force to become more destructive over time. Stuxnet is testament to this fact. International law must develop a technique, standard or tool capable of enabling the \"correctness\" or legitimacy of cyber operations to be determined decisively.¹⁷⁹ \"A mystified opposition between a primitive past and an advanced present/future becomes the interpretative device for understanding doctrinal progress (correctness, determinacy, social relevance)\",¹⁸⁰ cyber progress for international law will only be achieved through a transition from \"fragmentation to standardization\",¹⁸¹ from \"academic formalism to pragmatism\"¹⁸² and from politics to process.",

The international community needs to recognise that the face of belligerence is changing; instead of allowing cyber operations to increase in their severity over time, the international community must facilitate the creation of a new cyber orientated legal framework. The name and shame culture that the US appears to be developing may well be one of the first steps towards regulating inter-state uses of cyber force and bringing cyberspace into the paradigm of force.",

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force” and “uses of cyber coercion”.\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945 and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain. Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\". In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war. The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello are regulated. The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s. At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state. The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.\n \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law. The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\" in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009. The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\" Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\" The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence. Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\". There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\" which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war. According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE], \"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\" Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly \"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\" However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations. Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this \"normative ambiguity.\"\nInternational law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace. Schreier contends that cyber force has been \"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\", however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force. This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to \"return to the basic building blocks of international law\" and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.\n## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?\nIt is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be\n\nADEO FRASER\nquestioned by considering that: cyberspace renders the threat of force rule obsolete; the underlying purpose of art. 2(4) was to regulate armed force alone; and there have not been sufficient developments in state practice to indicate that States have implicitly or explicitly accepted an expansion to art. 2(4) beyond mere armed force.\n## No Threats in Cyberspace\nArt. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.” The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.” Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable. Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion. The equivalence doctrine therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete. The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.\n Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n Guyana v.

Reports 1996, p. 226, International Court of Justice, 8 July 1996—in which, the ICJ stated that there is an equivalence of treatment between the use of force and the threat of force. Essentially the Court stated that if the use of force in a particular case is illegal, then the threat of force will also be illegal.\n Michael N. Schmitt, “The Law of Cyber Warfare: Quo Vadis?” (2014) 25 S.L.P.R. 256\n Yoram Dinstein, *War, Aggression and Self Defence*, 5th Edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force. However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force. Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion. If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.\nFor art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met” namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure. The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93\nADEO FRASER\nuse of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force. There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces” irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel. Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction. Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon. In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.” States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.” This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack. The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67\n\nADEO FRASER\nArt. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour\nArt. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia. No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold. However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nthe authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.\nStuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer” that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level” because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges” the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code” was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran. Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran. Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.” Some members of the International Group of Experts were\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77\nADEO FRASER\nof the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80\n## Economic Cyber Operation\nThe Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82\nIn 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\n\nADEO FRASER\n## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack\nIn 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor. The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries. Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004, the German Military Manual, and the 1997 US President's certification evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\" States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\". In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n ibid, pp. 26–27\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace” as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.” Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation” of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN, US, UK, Russian Federation and China have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold. Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.” There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.” The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II. Can These Various Forms of Cyber Activity be Brought within the Paradigm of Force, or is International Law Waiting for a Cyber Disaster?\n## The Changing Face of Belligerence\nThe evolution of belligerence has been predicated upon societal advancements and technological innovation.

We live in a world where drones are flown remotely across the world, bombs use GPS satellites to strike their targets, and warships and fighter planes are now vast data-processing centres. Technological innovation has combined with austerity measures to create a post-Iraq war political environment that finds states downsizing their conventional military forces and exploring more technologically advanced measures. Consequently, conventional military technology such as the tank is being rendered increasingly obsolete, whilst drone strikes are on the verge of becoming the cornerstone of western military foreign policy. Some critics have warned of the potential dangers of choosing technology in the apparent dichotomy between technology and manpower. However, state security is no longer a case of which state has the largest military force but rather a question of \"smart power\"; in other words, which state has the best regular and irregular defence mechanisms to resist both orthodox and unorthodox military operations.\nThe Cold War centred on the playing out of tensions and the expansion of spheres of influence. Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold. The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force. Failure to do so will only lead to greater uncertainty,\n Roscini, supra note 37, p. 1; William J Lynn III, Remarks on the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, As Delivered by Deputy Secretary of Defense (14 July 2011) http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1593 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n The Economist, supra note 4\n Tom Whitehead, Ben Riley Smith and Rosa Prince, \"British Army Could be Cut to Just 50,000 Over Next Four Years, Report Warns\" The Telegraph 9 March 2015 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11449136/British-Army-could-be-cut-to-just-50000-over-next-four-years-report-warns.html [Accessed 28 July 2015]; Richard Norton-Taylor, \"UK Ministers Turn on Critics of Defence Cuts\" The Guardian 22 June 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/jun/22/uk-ministers-turn-on-critics-of-defence-cuts [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Benjamin D Katz, \"Army Cuts Pose Threat to Tank, Gunmakers as Ground Wars Recede\" Bloomberg Business 7 July 2015 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/army-cuts-pose-threat-to-tank-gunmakers-as-ground-wars-recede [Accessed 28 July 2015]\n Kiran Stacey, \"US General Warns UK of Danger of Putting Technology over Manpower\" The Financial Times, 30 June 2015; Fleur Johns, Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011) pp. 15, 7-8\n Norton-Taylor, supra note 117\n David Painter, The Cold War: An International History (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 44-69, 71-78; Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld, Cyber Warfare: Techniques, Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners (Oxford: Elsevier, 2013) pp. 7-8\nADEO FRASER\nand incidents like the “Sony Pictures v North Korea” cyber operation arising with greater frequency. The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.” The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.” The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie. Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”. According to official FBI reports, North Korea ordered a group of covert cyber warriors under the moniker of the “Guardians of Peace”, but purported to be members of the Bureau 121 hacking unit, to retaliate by performing an offensive cyber operation on Sony Picture’s IT system.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force. For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war. However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.” The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them. The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future. In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n Schmitt, supra note 126\n Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation. The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce.\" Hence, it is evident that international law provides a wide range of possible response options to states that have fallen victim to malicious cyber operations.\nStates that fall victim to cyber operations that amount to internationally wrongful acts are entitled to engage in \"countermeasures\" providing that they can prove \"(1) breach of an international obligation owed to another State, and (2) attributability of the wrongful act to the State in question.\" Countermeasures provide states with a useful legal framework through which actions that would otherwise be unlawful, are legitimately used by an injured state to persuade a wrongdoing state to comply with international law. Countermeasures are solely available against states, and the predominant view is that they may not reach the level of a use of force but must be commensurate to the injury suffered. Countermeasures, be they cyber or non-cyber, have been recognised by the ICJ and arbitral tribunals as being permissible providing that the requisite conditions have been met, and that there is full compliance with the law governing them.\n Stephan Haggard and Jon R.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures. The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge. The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations. However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\" Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated. Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Several US Army officials have also stressed their views that conventional military force may be used in response to malicious cyber operations. From Gen. Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response. Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.” The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.” This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive” attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative” to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being” and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development. International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order. The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.” The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience. The event\n Eichensehr, supra note 157\n Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41\nADEO FRASER\nis disavowed in international law for a policy of prevention and containment and a correspondent scientific evaluation of all anticipated outcomes. However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”. This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.” A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history. For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space” for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.” Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force. Paving the way for, what Minkkinen would describe as “correctness”, pragmatically motivated decisions and judgments.\n---\n *ibid*\n *ibid*\n Ruth M.

Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\" Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle. The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law. International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\nADEO FRASER\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war. However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event. A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force.

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force”¹ and “uses of cyber coercion”².\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945³ and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n¹ The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n² Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n³ Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n87\nPact is needed because the face of belligerence is changing and incidents such as the Sony Picture cyber operation are arising with greater frequency. The article will conclude by emphasising that cyber structural fragility, coupled with the international community's event-centric attitude to the creation of international law, dangerously cultivates the perfect environment for an event that has the capability to be destructive.\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain.⁴ Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\".⁵ In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war.⁶ The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum⁷ and the jus in bello⁸ are regulated.⁹ The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s.¹⁰ At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state.¹¹ The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.¹²\n⁴ \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n⁵ Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n⁶ Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n⁷ Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n⁸ Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n⁹ Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n¹⁰ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n¹¹ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n¹² Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law.¹³ The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\"¹⁴ in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009.¹⁵ The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\"¹⁶ Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\"¹⁷ The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.¹⁸\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence.¹⁹ Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.²⁰\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\".²¹ There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\"²² which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law.

In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹\n³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n³⁷ Guyana v.

The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.⁴⁸\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure.⁴⁹ The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n⁴² Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴³ Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n⁴⁴ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n⁴⁵ UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n⁴⁶ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴⁷ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁸ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93\nADEO FRASER\nuse of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force.⁵⁰ There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces”⁵¹ irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel.⁵² Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction.⁵³ Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon.⁵⁴ In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.”⁵⁵ States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.”⁵⁶ This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”⁵⁷\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack.⁵⁸ The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n⁵⁰ Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n⁵¹ Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n⁵² Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n⁵³ Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n⁵⁴ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n⁵⁵ *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n⁵⁶ James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n⁵⁷ Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n⁵⁸ Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n93\n2(4) prohibition on the use of inter-state force, and recognises the importance of reporting threats to international peace and security to the Security Council before those threats materialise.59 However, one could argue that the literalists suffer from selective literalism as art. 51 refers to the \"inherent right of self-defence\".60\nThe inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67\n59 Ashley S Deeks, “Taming the Doctrine of Pre-Emption” in Marc Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 664\n60 Article 51 of The Charter of the United Nations 1945\n61 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA), Merits, Judgment, 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986 [hereinafter Nicaragua] 216, para. 228; Nicaragua v USA ICJ  p. 94; Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 191\n62 Nicaragua, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel pp. 615, 227\n63 Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 196\n64 Ian Brownlie, International Law and the Use of Force By States (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1963), p. 278\n65 Phillip Jessup, A Modern Law of Nations (Hamden, CT: Archon Books 1968), p. 166\n66 Louis Henkin, International Law: Politics, Values and Functions (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff 1990), p. 156\n67 Brownlie, supra note 64, p. 278; Henkin, supra note 66, p. 156; Jessup, supra note 65, p. 166; Case Concerning the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo  ICJ Rep 168, pp. 223–224; Eritrea Ethiopia Claims Commission Partial Award, Jus ad Bellum, 19 December 2005, Vol. XXVI, p. 433; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\nthe authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰\nStuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77\nADEO FRASER\nof the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80\n## Economic Cyber Operation\nThe Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82\nIn 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n79 Jonathan Fildes, “Stuxnet Work ‘Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets’” BBC News 23 September 2010 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018 [Accessed 20 June 2012]\n80 Mary Ellen O’Connell, “Cyber Security Without Cyber War” 17 (2012) J.L.C. p. 201; Louise Arimatsu, “Classifying Cyber Warfare” in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchanan (ed.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015) p. 330; Schmitt, supra note 26, s. 13 rule 15\n81 Jaak Aaviksoo, “Cyberattacks Against Estonia Raised Awareness of Cyberthreats” (2010) 3 D.A.T.R. pp. 13–22\n82 Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n83 Katherine Hinkle, “Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry About” (2011) 37 Y.J.I.L 11, pp. 13–14\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n97\nof essential resources. $^{84}$ In any event, the disruptive cyber operations on Estonia did not result in material damage or significant disruption, and therefore cannot be regarded as a cyber use of force. $^{85}$ Even though the Estonian cyber operation may not have reached the use of force threshold, it was an unlawful cyber intervention and thus, a use of cyber coercion. $^{86}$\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein.

The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor.⁹² The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries.⁹³ Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.⁹⁴\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004,⁹⁵ the German Military Manual,⁹⁶ and the 1997 US President's certification⁹⁷ evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\"⁹⁸ States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\".⁹⁹ In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n⁹² Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n⁹³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n⁹⁴ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n⁹⁵ “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n⁹⁶ German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n⁹⁷ Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n⁹⁸ “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n⁹⁹ ibid, pp. 26–27\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n99\nhave been entitled to respond to the cyber uses of force with military force. The term “cyber war” therefore fails to appreciate the fact that cyber operations must reach a “certain level of intensity” in order to trigger an armed conflict. The failure of international law to effectively regulate low intensity cyber operations is fostering a culture, rather a cyber shadow, in which states seek to use cyber operations as an instrument of national policy.\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰⁰ came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace”¹⁰¹ as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.”¹⁰² Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation”¹⁰³ of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN¹⁰⁴, US¹⁰⁵, UK¹⁰⁶, Russian Federation¹⁰⁷ and China¹⁰⁸ have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.¹⁰⁹\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n¹⁰⁰ Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n¹⁰¹ Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰² Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰³ Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n¹⁰⁴ UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n¹⁰⁵ CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n¹⁰⁶ UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n¹⁰⁷ Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n¹⁰⁸ Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n¹⁰⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold.¹¹⁰ Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.”¹¹¹ There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.¹¹²\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.”¹¹³ The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II. Can These Various Forms of Cyber Activity be Brought within the Paradigm of Force, or is International Law Waiting for a Cyber Disaster?\n## The Changing Face of Belligerence¹¹⁴\nThe evolution of belligerence has been predicated upon societal advancements and technological innovation.

Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold.¹²¹ The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force.

The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.”¹²² The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.”¹²³ The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie.¹²⁴ Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force.¹³² For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war.¹³³ However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.”¹³⁴ The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them.¹³⁵ The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future.¹³⁶ In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n¹³² Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³³ Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³⁴ Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹³⁵ Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n¹³⁶ Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n105\nto reasonably conclude that the government of North Korea was responsible for the Sony Pictures cyber operation.¹³⁷ The Guardians of Peace were deployed by the military's General Bureau of Reconnaissance, who are state \"organs\"; consequently the hackers' actions are attributable to North Korea even if the hackers were acting beyond the scope of their authority.¹³⁸ In this instance, the US did not have the right to self-defence as the cyber operation was a use of cyber coercion that failed to reach the armed attack threshold. However, the US would have been entitled to respond to the violation of its sovereignty.\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation.¹³⁹ The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce.\"¹⁴⁰ Hence, it is evident that international law provides a wide range of possible response options to states that have fallen victim to malicious cyber operations.\nStates that fall victim to cyber operations that amount to internationally wrongful acts are entitled to engage in \"countermeasures\" providing that they can prove \"(1) breach of an international obligation owed to another State, and (2) attributability of the wrongful act to the State in question.\"¹⁴¹ Countermeasures provide states with a useful legal framework through which actions that would otherwise be unlawful, are legitimately used by an injured state to persuade a wrongdoing state to comply with international law.¹⁴² Countermeasures are solely available against states, and the predominant view is that they may not reach the level of a use of force but must be commensurate to the injury suffered.¹⁴³ Countermeasures, be they cyber or non-cyber, have been recognised by the ICJ and arbitral tribunals as being permissible providing that the requisite conditions have been met, and that there is full compliance with the law governing them.¹⁴⁴\n¹³⁷ Stephan Haggard and Jon R.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures.¹⁴⁵ The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge.¹⁴⁶ The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility¹⁴⁷ indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations.¹⁴⁸ However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\"¹⁴⁹ Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.¹⁵⁰ Unilateral\net Avant que le Portugal ne Participât à la Guerre (Port. v.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated.¹⁵⁵ Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.¹⁵⁶\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response.¹⁵⁹ Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.”¹⁶⁰ The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.”¹⁶¹ This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive”¹⁶² attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative”¹⁶⁵ to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being”¹⁶⁶ and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development.¹⁶⁷ International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order.¹⁶⁸ The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.¹⁶⁹\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.”¹⁷⁰ The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.¹⁷¹ The event\n¹⁶³ Eichensehr, supra note 157\n¹⁶⁴ Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n¹⁶⁵ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁶ Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n¹⁶⁷ Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n¹⁶⁸ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁹ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n¹⁷⁰ Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n¹⁷¹ Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41\nADEO FRASER\nis disavowed in international law for a policy of prevention and containment and a correspondent scientific evaluation of all anticipated outcomes. However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”.¹⁷² This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.¹⁷³\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.”¹⁷⁴ A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history.¹⁷⁵ For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space”¹⁷⁶ for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.”¹⁷⁷ Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force. Paving the way for, what Minkkinen would describe as “correctness”,¹⁷⁸ pragmatically motivated decisions and judgments.\n---\n¹⁷² *ibid*\n¹⁷³ *ibid*\n¹⁷⁴ Ruth M.

However, the reality of the cyber landscape is that there are a plethora of alternative cyber options available to states that international law has failed to pay attention to. A cause for concern is that a lack of substantive regulation has enabled states to develop their cyber capabilities and provided an ideal climate for cyber uses of force to become more destructive over time. Stuxnet is testament to this fact. International law must develop a technique, standard or tool capable of enabling the \"correctness\" or legitimacy of cyber operations to be determined decisively.¹⁷⁹ \"A mystified opposition between a primitive past and an advanced present/future becomes the interpretative device for understanding doctrinal progress (correctness, determinacy, social relevance)\",¹⁸⁰ cyber progress for international law will only be achieved through a transition from \"fragmentation to standardization\",¹⁸¹ from \"academic formalism to pragmatism\"¹⁸² and from politics to process.\nIt appears futile to condemn cyber conflict, or attempt to eradicate the inevitable transition into this period's peculiar form of war. Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\"¹⁸³ Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle.¹⁸⁴ The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law.¹⁸⁵ International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n¹⁷⁹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n¹⁸⁰ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n¹⁸¹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸² Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸³ Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n¹⁸⁴ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n¹⁸⁵ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\nADEO FRASER\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war.¹⁸⁶ However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event.¹⁸⁷ A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force. President Barack Obama has already indicated his intention for the US to\n¹⁸⁶ Dinstein, *supra* note 41, pp. 84–87\n¹⁸⁷ Chantal Mouffe, “Schmitte’s Vision of Multipolar World Order” (2005) 104 S.A.Q 248\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n113\nbecome much more aggressive in cyber space.¹⁸⁸ One can only wonder what a cyber operation much more aggressive than Stuxnet would look like. The international community needs to recognise that the face of belligerence is changing; instead of allowing cyber operations to increase in their severity over time, the international community must facilitate the creation of a new cyber orientated legal framework. The name and shame culture that the US appears to be developing may well be one of the first steps towards regulating inter-state uses of cyber force and bringing cyberspace into the paradigm of force.\n¹⁸⁸ President Barack Obama, “Remarks by President Obama in Press Conference after G7 Summit” (8 June 2015) http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/08/remarks-president-obama-press-conference-after-g7-summit [Accessed 9 September 2015]"

Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force”¹ and “uses of cyber coercion”².\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945³ and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand ¹ The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force ² Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n³ Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain.⁴ Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\".⁵ In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war.⁶ The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum⁷ and the jus in bello⁸ are regulated.⁹ The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s.¹⁰ At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state.¹¹ The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.¹²\n⁴ \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n⁵ Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n⁶ Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n⁷ Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n⁸ Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory. The ius in bello concentrates on indicating what the belligerent parties may or may not do during an armed conduct.\"\n⁹ Dino Kritsiotis, \"Enforced Equations\" (2013) 24 E.J.I.L 139\n¹⁰ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, \"CyberWar is Coming\" (1993) 12 C.S. pp. 141-165\n¹¹ John Arquilla and David Ronfelt, In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age (California: Rand Corporation 1997), p. 27, p. 46—in which they distinguish between the terms \"cyberwar\" and \"netwar\".\n¹² Laurie R Blank, \"Cyberwar versus Cyber Attack: The Role of Rhetoric in the Application of Law to Activities in Cyberspace\" in Jens David Ohlin, Kevin Govern and Claire Finkelstein (ed), CyberWar: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 79; Samuel Liles, Marcus Rogers, J. Eric Dietz and Dean Larson, \"Fourth International Conference\nADEO FRASER\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law.¹³ The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\"¹⁴ in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009.¹⁵ The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\"¹⁶ Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\"¹⁷ The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.¹⁸\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence.¹⁹ Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.²⁰\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\".²¹ There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\"²² which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law. Terms such as \"cyber uses of force\" and \"uses of cyber coercion\" are capable of taking steps towards reconceptualising the cyber\non Cyber Conflict: Applying Traditional Military Principles to Cyber Warfare\" (Tallinn: NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2012), p. 170\n¹³ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁴ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁵ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁶ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77\n¹⁷ Blank, supra note 12, p. 77; Thomas Rid, Cyber War Will Not Take Place (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 9\n¹⁸ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n¹⁹ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²⁰ Blank, supra note 12, p. 78\n²¹ Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\n²² Rid, supra note 17, p. 37\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\nThe Hague Conventions²³, the Geneva Conventions²⁴, the Charter of the United Nations and related treaties are the foundation from which to assess acts of war.²⁵ According to the International Group of Experts [hereinafter IGE],\"both the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello apply to cyber operations.\"²⁶ Current international legal norms quite clearly predate the emergence of cyber technology and there is a danger that cyber practice may rapidly\"outdistance agreed understandings as to its governing legal regime.\"²⁷ However, the lack of a definitive cyber authority does not provide states with the ability to disregard applicable international law in the context of their cyber operations.²⁸ Nevertheless the international community is justifiably concerned about this\"normative ambiguity.\"²⁹ International law is both applicable and essential to the maintenance of peace and stability in cyberspace.³⁰ Schreier contends that cyber force has been\"the most influential instrument of the past two decades\",³¹ however the influence of cyber force as an instrument of national military strategy has not been reflected in the development of a binding and effective framework through which international law can regulate cyber force.³² This may be a result of the fact that cyber operations strain the traditional understandings of war; consequently the international community is being forced to\"return to the basic building blocks of international law\"³³ and re-assess armed conflicts and uses of force through a cyber lens.\n## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?\nIt is clear and apparent that States still see armed force as being a quintessential element of the art. 2(4) prohibition on the use of force. While there have been suggestions that art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond armed force, but this can be ADEO FRASER questioned by considering that: cyberspace renders the threat of force rule obsolete; the underlying purpose of art. 2(4) was to regulate armed force alone; and there have not been sufficient developments in state practice to indicate that States have implicitly or explicitly accepted an expansion to art. 2(4) beyond mere armed force.\n## No Threats in Cyberspace Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is widely regarded to be the “bedrock of modern international law.”³⁴ The first clause of art. 2(4) of the UN Charter is the most important, as it crucially states that: “[a]ll members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force.”³⁵ Art. 2(4) provides neither a definition for “force” nor “threats of force”. In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷ However, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹ ³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007) ³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations ³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15 ³⁷ Guyana v.

Essentially the Court stated that if the use of force in a particular case is illegal, then the threat of force will also be illegal.\n⁴⁰ Michael N. Schmitt, “The Law of Cyber Warfare: Quo Vadis?” (2014) 25 S.L.P.R. 256 ⁴¹ Yoram Dinstein, *War, Aggression and Self Defence*, 5th Edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 191 From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard The normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force.⁴² However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force.⁴³ Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion.⁴⁴ If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”⁴⁵ as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.⁴⁶ For art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met”⁴⁷ namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.⁴⁸ Cyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure.⁴⁹ The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the ⁴² Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45 ⁴³ Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion ⁴⁴ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129 ⁴⁵ UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff ⁴⁶ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45 ⁴⁷ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44 ⁴⁸ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44 ⁴⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93 ADEO FRASER use of armed force and alternative forms of coercion such as political or economic force.⁵⁰ There is no definition in either the *jus ad bellum* or *jus in bello* framework for a “weapon”. A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces”⁵¹ irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel.⁵² Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction.⁵³ Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon.⁵⁴ In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.”⁵⁵ States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.”⁵⁶ This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”⁵⁷ ## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4) In order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack.⁵⁸ The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n⁵⁰ Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611 ⁵¹ Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23 ⁵² Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1 ⁵³ Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69 ⁵⁴ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50 ⁵⁵ *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39 ⁵⁶ James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015] ⁵⁷ Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280 ⁵⁸ Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191 From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard The inherent right perspective adopts the ICJ's line of reasoning in Nicaragua and the Caroline Correspondence (1838–1842), as the legal foundation for the argument that an armed attack need not have occurred to trigger the customary right of self-defence. The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term\"inherent right\"is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51: [t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62 Schwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence. This position has been reaffirmed in international legal jurisprudence.67 ADEO FRASER Art. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour Art. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n## Types of Cyber Activity The term\"cyber war\"completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n## Physical Cyber Operation The\"Original Logic Bomb\"is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove ⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18 ⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012) From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard the authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰ Stuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵ The Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18 ⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10 ⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208 ⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31 ⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32 ⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42 ⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv ⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77 ADEO FRASER of the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80 ## Economic Cyber Operation The Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82 In 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that\"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"The cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## Information Orientated Cyber Operation\nInformation orientated cyber operations are arguably a 21st century form of espionage or military reconnaissance; espionage is not prohibited in international law. $^{87}$ Examples of information orientated cyber operations include Titan Rain and the Office of Personnel Management cyber operation in 2015, which resulted in the misappropriation of the sensitive information of 21 million US citizens. $^{88}$ Titan Rain was designed to appropriate information from targeted computer networks and is predicted to have successfully hacked Pentagon military computer networks and British government computer networks. $^{89}$ Information orientated cyber operations or cyber exploitation, are “never a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter” $^{90}$ because they do not affect the functionality of the target system nor seek to corrupt, amend or delete the data resident therein. Essentially, cyber uses of force must have some destructive element, therefore the often covert information orientated cyber operations that seek to acquire information non-destructively should neither be categorised as cyber uses of force nor use of cyber coercion. $^{91}$\n\nADEO FRASER ## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack In 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor.⁹² The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries.⁹³ Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.⁹⁴ ## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality State practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004,⁹⁵ the German Military Manual,⁹⁶ and the 1997 US President's certification⁹⁷ evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements\"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\"⁹⁸ States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as\"border clashes\",\"skirmishes\"and\"incidents\".⁹⁹ In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates\"most grave\"cyber uses of force.\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing.

The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰⁰ came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace”¹⁰¹ as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.”¹⁰² Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation”¹⁰³ of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN¹⁰⁴, US¹⁰⁵, UK¹⁰⁶, Russian Federation¹⁰⁷ and China¹⁰⁸ have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.¹⁰⁹\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold. The four types of cyber activity highlight how the current cyber climate consists of diffuse, low intensity cyber operations that are\n¹⁰⁰ Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime, Budapest, 23 November 2001 (CETS 158), The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime 2001 http://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680081561 [Accessed 16 February 2016]\n¹⁰¹ Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰² Beidleman, supra note 25, p. 11\n¹⁰³ Matthew C Waxman, “Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)” (2011) 36 Yale Journal of International Law 437\n¹⁰⁴ UN Doc A/68/98 (24 June 2013), p. 8\n¹⁰⁵ CarrieLyn Guymon (ed.), Digest of United States Practice in International Law (2012), p. 594; UN Doc A/66/152 (15 July 2011), p. 18\n¹⁰⁶ UN Doc A/65/154 (20 July 2010), p. 15\n¹⁰⁷ Conceptual Views on the Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space (9 September 2000), p. 6 http://ccdcoe.org/strategies/Russian_Federation_unofficial_translation.pdf [Accessed 6 August 2015]\n¹⁰⁸ Li Zhang, “A Chinese Perspective on Cyberwar” (2012) 94 ICRC 4\n¹⁰⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, pp. 19–21\nADEO FRASER\nunlikely to reach the armed attack threshold.¹¹⁰ Roscini equates cyber operations “falling short of an armed attack” Gray’s description of the frequency of frontier incidents in conventional military operations to emphasise the fact that “low-intensity cyber-attacks are the most common form of force between States.”¹¹¹ There are numerous advantages for states that choose to conduct cyber operations that amount to cyber uses of force or uses of cyber coercion, such as their being easier to conduct, less expensive, minimising the risk of a response by the victim state and effective in impeding a target state’s social, technological and economic development.¹¹²\nInternational law can no longer allow states to use cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion as an instrument of national policy. The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.”¹¹³ The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n## II. Can These Various Forms of Cyber Activity be Brought within the Paradigm of Force, or is International Law Waiting for a Cyber Disaster?\n## The Changing Face of Belligerence¹¹⁴\nThe evolution of belligerence has been predicated upon societal advancements and technological innovation.

Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold.¹²¹ The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force. The international community must change the way it conceptualises and characterises inter-state cyber activity because cyber operations are a manifestation of force.

The only way one can know how and whether cyber activity can be brought within the paradigm of force is looking at incidents such as the Sony v North Korea cyber operation, because “occasionally there are going to be breaches like this. They’re going to be costly. They’re going to be serious.”¹²² The danger is that without bringing cyber activity into the paradigm of force, without drawing the proverbial battle lines and without making the rules of conduct clear and apparent to all participants, the international community is surrendering its ability to create international law to the event. In other words, the international community is on the verge of resigning its norm creative force to the tremors of potentially destructive events.\n## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty\nThe Sony Pictures v North Korea incident stemmed from Sony Pictures production of a “comedy” film that centred on the CIA sponsored plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s “supreme leader”. North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.”¹²³ The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie.¹²⁴ Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”. According to official FBI reports, North Korea ordered a group of covert cyber warriors under the moniker of the “Guardians of Peace”, but purported to be members of the Bureau 121 hacking unit, to retaliate by performing an offensive cyber operation on Sony Picture’s IT system.¹²⁵ As a result\n¹²² President Barack Obama, “Remarks by the President in Year-End Press Conference” (19 December 2014) http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/19/remarks-president-year-end-press-conference [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹²³ Justin Moyer, “Why North Korea has Every Reason to be Upset About Sony’s ‘The Interview’” Washington Post 16 December 2014 http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/16/why-north-korea-has-every-reason-to-be-upset-about-the-interview/ [Accessed 20 August 2015; Ben Beaumont-Thomas, “North Korea Complains To UN About Seth Rogen Comedy The Interview” The Guardian 10 July 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/north-korea-un-the-interview-seth-rogen-james-franco [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹²⁴ Martin Fackler, Brooks Barnes and David Sanger, “Sony’s International Incident: Making Kim Jong Un’s Head Explode” New York Times 14 December 2014\n¹²⁵ Andrew Griffin, “Why North Korea Probably Didn’t Hack Sony—At Least On Their Own” The Independent 17 December 2014 http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/sony-hack-who-are-the-guardians-of-peace-and-is-north-korea-really-behind-the-attack-9931282.html [Accessed 20 August 2015]; Obama, supra note 122; Oliver Laughland and Dominic Rushe, “Sony Cyber Attack Linked To North Korean Government Hackers, FBI Says” The Guardian 19 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/19/north-korea-responsible\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## How Does International Law Interpret This Event?\nThe international community is in agreement that the malicious cyber operation conducted by North Korea against Sony Pictures was neither an armed attack nor\nsony-hack-us-official [Accessed 20 August 2015]; Brian Stelter, “Hackers To Sony: We’ll Stand Down if you Never Release the Movie” CNNMoney 19 December 2015 http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/19/media/inside-sony-hack-interview/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹²⁶ Michael Schmitt, “International Law and Cyber Attacks: Sony v.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force.¹³² For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war.¹³³ However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.”¹³⁴ The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them.¹³⁵ The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future.¹³⁶ In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n¹³² Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³³ Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³⁴ Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹³⁵ Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n¹³⁶ Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n\n## What Were the US's Possible Response Options?\nThe US government has declared its intention to proportionately respond to the significant damage that was caused by the Sony Pictures cyber operation.¹³⁹ The US response is likely to be a multifaceted operation with covert elements: \"we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures.¹⁴⁵ The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge.¹⁴⁶ The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility¹⁴⁷ indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations.¹⁴⁸ However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\"¹⁴⁹ Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.¹⁵⁰ Unilateral\net Avant que le Portugal ne Participât à la Guerre (Port. v.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated.¹⁵⁵ Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.¹⁵⁶ NATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber Marossi and Marisa R.

Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response.¹⁵⁹ Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.”¹⁶⁰ The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects... That’s not necessarily the case.”¹⁶¹ This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive”¹⁶² attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative”¹⁶⁵ to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being”¹⁶⁶ and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development.¹⁶⁷ International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order.¹⁶⁸ The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.¹⁶⁹\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.”¹⁷⁰ The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.¹⁷¹ The event\n¹⁶³ Eichensehr, supra note 157\n¹⁶⁴ Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n¹⁶⁵ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁶ Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n¹⁶⁷ Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n¹⁶⁸ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁹ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n¹⁷⁰ Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n¹⁷¹ Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41\nADEO FRASER\nis disavowed in international law for a policy of prevention and containment and a correspondent scientific evaluation of all anticipated outcomes. However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”.¹⁷² This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.¹⁷³\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.”¹⁷⁴ A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history.¹⁷⁵ For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space”¹⁷⁶ for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.”¹⁷⁷ Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force. Paving the way for, what Minkkinen would describe as “correctness”,¹⁷⁸ pragmatically motivated decisions and judgments.\n---\n¹⁷² *ibid*\n¹⁷³ *ibid*\n¹⁷⁴ Ruth M.

Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the\"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied\"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\"¹⁸³ Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle.¹⁸⁴ The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law.¹⁸⁵ International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n¹⁷⁹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75 ¹⁸⁰ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78 ¹⁸¹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77 ¹⁸² Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77 ¹⁸³ Arnold D McNair,\"Collective Security\"(1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155 ¹⁸⁴ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84 ¹⁸⁵ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84 ADEO FRASER Admittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war.¹⁸⁶ However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event.¹⁸⁷ A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n## Conclusion Cyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force.

The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove ⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18 ⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012) From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard the authenticity of this alleged sequence of events; Russia has labelled this theory as false.⁷⁰ Stuxnet is a more legitimate representation of a cyber use of force that causes physical destruction than the “Original Logic Bomb” theory. Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵ The Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18 ⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10 ⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208 ⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31 ⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32 ⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42 ⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv ⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015] ⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77 ADEO FRASER of the opinion that this cyber operation reached the armed attack threshold, largely because Stuxnet targeted real world natural critical infrastructure such as water plants, industrial units and power stations.79 However, the fact that Iran itself has not adopted this line of argumentation, combined with the relatively small scale of the damage incurred from the cyber operation, consolidates the position of the majority of scholars who argue that Stuxnet was merely a cyber use of force.80 ## Economic Cyber Operation The Estonian cyber operation was an extensive coordinated attack against Estonian financial service providers, media outlets and government infrastructure. The 2007 cyber operation was essentially designed to foment civil unrest and destabilise the Estonian government.81 Russia was alleged to have been the architect of the malicious cyber operations, however Russia denied liability and there has been insufficient evidence to conclusively link the cyber operation to them.82 In 2007, Estonia was more vulnerable than most states to cyber operations. Estonia was a technologically dependent State in the sense that all of the State's vital services were tied to the internet e.g. parliamentary websites, banking services and media broadcasters. Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that\"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"The cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability|## ALWD 7th ed.|## Bluebook 21st ed.|## APA 7th ed.|__preamble__|## Has Art. 2(4) Been Expanded Beyond Armed Force?|## “The Interview”—Sony Pictures v North Korea (2014): An Example of the Problems Emanating out of This Uncertainty|## OSCOLA 4th ed.\npayload_tokens_before:1929\npayload_tokens_after:5283\ndropped_section:None\nadded_section:## OSCOLA 4th ed.\n---LOG_SUMMARY_END---",

    "86\n\nFrom the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard: International Law’s Failure to Define a ‘Cyber Use of Force’ is Dangerous and May Lead to a Military Response to a ‘Cyber Use of Force’\n\nADEO FRASER\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis article will argue that the failure to reconceptualise the cyber discourse may well result in a military response to a cyber use of force. Furthermore, it will be argued that the international community must reclaim its ability to create international norms back from the “event” by bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force, cultivating a cyber naming-and-shaming culture, and creating a completely new framework that defines inter-state “cyber uses of force”¹ and “uses of cyber coercion”².\n\nThe first part of this article will begin by showing that the term “cyber war” is a deceptively dangerous and problematic concept. It fails to appreciate either the force paradigm or the variety of cyber options available to states. The initial part will also outline different types of cyber activity, highlighting that most cyber operations are not “cyber uses of force” but “uses of cyber coercion”. Moreover, it will evaluate whether cyber operations fall within the scope of art. 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945³ and provide evidence that states have not expressly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4) of the UN Charter beyond armed force.\n\nThe second and final section will evaluate the Sony Pictures v North Korea cyber operation. It will outline the possible response options available to the US to stress the fact that as things stand international law may well permit a military response to a cyber use of force. This section will also show that a Cyber Kellogg-Briand\n\n¹ The phrase “cyber uses of force” defines those cyber operations that constitute uses of force\n² Thomas Shelling, *Arms and Influence* (Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 4—“Coercion requires finding a bargain, arranging for him to be better off doing what we want—worse off not doing what we want—when he takes the threatened penalty into account.” Shelling distinguishes between “brute force” and “coercion”; this article will accordingly distinguish between cyber uses of force and describe those cyber operations that fall short of force as uses of cyber coercion.\n“Uses of cyber coercion”—defines those operations that fail to reach the cyber use of force threshold i.e. cyber interventions that fall short of force.\n³ Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations 1945, which states that: “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”",
    "From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n87\n\nPact is needed because the face of belligerence is changing and incidents such as the Sony Picture cyber operation are arising with greater frequency. The article will conclude by emphasising that cyber structural fragility, coupled with the international community's event-centric attitude to the creation of international law, dangerously cultivates the perfect environment for an event that has the capability to be destructive.\n\n## I. Can There Be a Cyber Use of Force?\n\n### Cyber War is a Problematic Term\n\nCyberspace is warfare's fifth domain.⁴ Moreover, it is likely that Clausewitz would classify cyber war as this period's \"peculiar form of War\".⁵ In the history of modern warfare there has been a distinct and deliberate re-characterisation of war.⁶ The term \"war\" is an outdated concept, and in spite of its frequent reoccurrence in political rhetoric, international law has rendered the term \"war\" obsolete. The notion neither governs the way in which international law characterises what is now referred to as \"force\" or an \"armed conflict\", nor provides the operational premise through which the jus ad bellum⁷ and the jus in bello⁸ are regulated.⁹ The use of the term \"cyber war\" can be traced back to the early 1990s.¹⁰ At the time, the term was thought of as exciting and thought-provoking, but those who employed it implicitly conceded the need for a more complex legal lexicon that more effectively addressed the intricacies and varieties of cyber operations available to the state.¹¹ The term \"cyber war\" has no definitive definition; most definitions employ \"war\" as a rhetorical and descriptive term as opposed to an entrenched legal notion.¹²\n\n⁴ \"War in the Fifth Domain\" The Economist 1 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16478792 [Accessed 4 August 2015]\n⁵ Carl von Clausewitz, On War (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co 1940), Book VIII, Chapter III.B, p. 103\n⁶ Jann K Kleffner, \"Scope of Application of International Humanitarian Law\" In Fleck D (ed), Handbook Of The International Humanitarian Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 202\n⁷ Andrew Clapham and Paola Gaeta, The Oxford Handbook of International Law in Armed Conflict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 379—defines the jus ad bellum as \"the rules of international law regulating the legality of recourse to armed force in international relations\".\n⁸ Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde, An Introduction to the International Law of Armed Conflicts (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2008), p. 21—defines the jus in bello as addressing \"the conduct of the belligerents during an armed conflict or a belligerent occupation of territory.

    "ADEO FRASER\n\nIn mainstream media rhetoric, the term has been used to describe an array of activities which for the most part fall well short of the meaning of \"armed attack\" or \"war\" within international law.¹³ The most high profile cyber operations of the last decade have \"fanned the flames of rhetorical flourish\"¹⁴ in their portrayal of events and potential events in cyberspace. The rhetorical popularity of the notion is evidenced by the fact that the use of the term \"cyber war\" in the mainstream media in the years 2010–2012 was triple that of any year before 2009.¹⁵ The term has fallen victim to \"runaway rhetoric;\"¹⁶ Blank draws comparisons between cyber warfare rhetoric and the rhetoric used in the \"war on terror\" to illustrate the impact that rhetoric may have \"on the development and implementation of the law.\"¹⁷ The rhetorical \"war on terror\" facilitated the minimising of rights and magnification of executive powers, ultimately having a profound effect on both policy and law pertaining to counterterrorism and conflict.¹⁸\n\nOne could argue that rhetoric that makes use of terms such as \"cyber war\" may well have the effect of creating a legal climate in which a state has fewer impediments to an aggressive response to malicious cyber activity. If manipulated in this way, such rhetoric seriously risks the possibility of escalating or elevating a hostile action to full-fledged belligerence.¹⁹ Thus the overuse of such rhetoric not only facilitates overly broad responses but also the blurring of the inter-disciplinary lines, which are crucial in ensuring both the development of the applicable and relevant legal framework and the preservation of individual rights.²⁰\n\nActs of war must be potentially lethal whilst instrumental and political, regardless of the battleground. As there has not yet been a stand-alone cyber offence that meets all of these criteria, the term \"cyber war\" remains a \"tired and wasted metaphor\".²¹ There has been a \"mixing of legal terminology with legal discourse\"²² which has had a detrimental effect upon the characterisation and assessment of cyber operations in international law. Cyber war is a narrow notion that fails to appreciate the complexities of twenty-first century cyber operations. It is both distracting and counterproductive to engage in the discussion of the notion cyber war in this emerging area of law.

In order to fall within the scope of art. 2(4) and activate its intended coercive effect, a threat of force must be made known to the addressee state and must be clearly identifiable.³⁶ Roscini contends that a circumstantial approach should be adopted with respect to cyber threats, as the facts of each case play a key role in determining whether the recipient state justifiably feels threatened and accordingly whether the threatening state’s conduct amounts to a threat of force.³⁷\n\nHowever, state practice suggests that the term “force” in art. 2(4) does not include either threats or political or economic coercion.³⁸ The equivalence doctrine³⁹ therefore should not be applicable to the regulation of cyber force as there is a clear disparity between theory and practice. Moreover, given the fact that cyber operations are almost always covert, and the identification of the origin of cyber operations presents considerable technical problems, cyberspace renders the threat of force rule practically obsolete.⁴⁰ The core purpose of art. 2(4) was to create a prohibition on the use of armed force; as Dinstein fittingly puts it, mere threats are “beyond its pale”.⁴¹\n\n³⁴ Yoram Dinstein “Reviewed Work: The Threat of Force in International Law by Nikolas Stürchler” (2008) 102 American Journal of International Law 918; Nikolas Stürchler, *The Threat of Force in International Law* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007)\n\n³⁵ Art. 2(4) Charter of the United Nations\n\n³⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-defence and Armed Conflicts” in National Research Council of Academics (ed), *Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy* (Washington D.C.: National Academics Press 2010), p. 15\n\n³⁷ Guyana v.

    "From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n91\n\n# Armed Force Alone\n\nThe normal meaning of “force” is broad enough in scope to incorporate alternative types of coercion such as political and economic coercion in addition to armed force.⁴² However, the law on the use of force is not a general framework for dealing with all types of coercive behaviour; in the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice [hereinafter ICJ] emphasised the fact that art. 2(4) is very much linked to armed force.⁴³ Furthermore, contemporary UN documents support the notion that art. 2(4) is a reference solely to armed force, whereas the principle of non-intervention extends to alternative forms of coercion.⁴⁴ If one looks at art. 2(4) from a teleological perspective, it appears as though a narrow interpretation of art. 2(4) is necessary so as to limit the scope of the “force” to armed force, as the overarching purpose of the UN Charter was “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”⁴⁵ as opposed to banning all forms of coercion.⁴⁶\n\nFor art. 2(4) and its counterpart in customary international law “to apply to cyber operations, three conditions must be met”⁴⁷ namely i) the cyber operation must be attributable to a state, ii) the cyber operation must amount to a use of force, and iii) the cyber threat or use of force must arise in the context of “international relations”. The identification of the point of origin and the attribution of cyber operations to states has proved incredibly challenging and problematic in the contemporary cyber landscape. It might well be one of the biggest counter arguments to bringing cyber operations into the paradigm of force. However, assuming that a cyber operation is attributable to a state and arises in the context of international relations the only question is whether the cyber operation amounts to a use of force.⁴⁸\n\nCyber activity falls within the scope of art. 2(4) when states use cyber operations as a weapon to target people, property, and perhaps most crucially, national critical infrastructure.⁴⁹ The use of coercive weapons is the key distinction between the\n\n⁴² Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴³ Judge Higgins Separate Opinion Nicaragua Case pp. 847–861; Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion\n⁴⁴ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (XXV), 24 October 1970; Declaration on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (XXIX), 14 Dec 1974; Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations, GA Res 42/22, 18 November 1987; Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, “Art. 2 (4)” in Bruno Simma, Daniel-Erasmus Khan, Georg Nolte, and Andreas Paulus, The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 129\n⁴⁵ UN Charter, Preamble, UNTS, vol. 16, p. 1 ff\n⁴⁶ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 45\n⁴⁷ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁸ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44\n⁴⁹ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 44; Russell Buchanan, “Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions” (2012) 17 J.C.S.L 212; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), p. 74; Yoram Dinstein, “Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense” (2002) 76 I.L.S., p. 99, p. 103; Daniel B Silver, “Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force Under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter” (2002) 76 I.L.S., pp. 92–93",

A Red Cross study defined weapons as a “means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces”⁵¹ irrespective of whether the violence occurs. Weapons have also been defined as any device, mechanism or component intended to disable, injure or destroy enemy property, *materiel* or personnel.⁵² Both definitions identify weapons by their effects not the nature of the mechanism that produce damage or destruction.⁵³ Art. 2(4) requires a weapon to be used for a use of force, and malware can qualify as that weapon.⁵⁴ In the *Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion*, the ICJ stressed that arts 2(4), 41 and 51 of UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons. They apply to any use of force regardless of the weapons employed.”⁵⁵ States support the view that viruses, botnet codes, worms and other malware are to be treated as “just another weapons system, cheaper and faster than a missile, [and] potentially more covert.”⁵⁶ This is reflected in states’ creation of cyber specific military units, acknowledgment of cyberspace as a new domain of warfare and the incorporation of cyber technology in military doctrines. Thus, cyber operations must be perceived as a weapon “no less and no more than other weapons.”⁵⁷\n\n## States Have not Explicitly or Implicitly Accepted an Expansion to Art. 2(4)\n\nIn order to assess whether art. 2(4) has been expanded beyond mere armed force, one must examine whether through their invocation of the art. 51 right to self-defence states have explicitly or implicitly expanded art. 2(4). There are two main perspectives on the right to self-defence, namely the literalist perspective and the inherent right perspective. The literalist, or strict-conditionalist, perspective is the view that a state may not exercise its art. 51 right to self-defence unless, or until, it has suffered from an armed attack.⁵⁸ The strict conditionalist perspective reflects the desire of the international community to effectively enforce the art.\n\n⁵⁰ Oliver Dorr, “Use of Force, Prohibition of” in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law: Vol X* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 611\n⁵¹ Jean-Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, *Customary International Humanitarian Law: Vol I* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 23\n⁵² Yoram Dinstein, *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflicts*, 2nd Ed (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 1\n⁵³ Katharina Ziolkowski, “Computer Network Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict” (2010) 49 M.L.L.W.R. 69\n⁵⁴ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 50\n⁵⁵ *Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion, 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, para. 39\n⁵⁶ James Lewis, “To Protect the US Against Cyberwar, Best Defence is a Good Offense” *US News and World Report* 29 March 2010 http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/03/29/to-protect-the-us-against-cyberwar-best-defense-is-a-good-offense [Accessed 13 August 2015]\n⁵⁷ Yoram Dinstein, “Cyber War and International Law: Concluding Remarks at the 2012 Naval War College International Law Conference” (2013) 89 I.L.S. 280\n⁵⁸ Sean Murphy, “The Doctrine of Pre-emptive Self-Defence” (2005) 50 V.L.R. 706; Dinstein, *supra* note 41, p. 191",

The ICJ in Nicaragua held that the term \"inherent right\" is a reference to the right to self-defence existing in customary international law that predates the 1945 inception of the armed attack. According to the ICJ, the drafters of the Charter thereby recognised and desired to preserve the customary international right to self-defence, at least in essence.61 In his dissenting opinion in Nicaragua, Judge Schwebel resolutely rejected the strict conditionalist and literalist approach to art. 51:\n\n[t]hat is not to say that Article 2, paragraph 4, and Article 51 of the Charter occupy the whole field of the use of force in international relations. It is not to say, for example, that necessarily there is no scope to self-defence or to protection of nationals apart from Article 51 and Article 2, paragraph 4.62\n\nSchwebel interpreted art. 51 as outlining only one form of self-defence, without negating alternative patterns of permissible uses of force in self-defence vouchsafed by art. 51's customary counterpart.63 Nonetheless, most states and academics side with literalists such as Brownlie64, Jessup65 and Henkin66, who perceive the armed attack to be the clearest and most objective trigger for the right to self-defence.

    "ADEO FRASER\n\nArt. 2(4) Is Not a General Framework for Dealing with all Types of Coercive Behaviour\n\nArt. 2(4) is potentially amenable against its own purity as it means something very specific, namely that armed force is prohibited. But it has been formulated and drafted in such a way that renders it susceptible to legal manipulation and thus vulnerable to being construed to mean something completely different from what was intended. The problem is that art. 2(4) is not a norm in isolation; rather it is a framework of thinking. It would be extremely dangerous to play around with the words of art. 2(4) as it is crucial to remember the interconnectivity of art. 2(4) to other provisions in the UN Charter, particularly art. 51. Art. 2(4) as it stands, is unable to address the variety of cyber operations available to the state. Art. 2(4) was given a specific mandate in 1945, and that was to deter and regulate armed force. Art. 2(4) cannot be expanded to address the disparaging effects of states using different cyber activities. Nevertheless, cyber operations need to be brought into the paradigm of force. In other words, the international community needs to look at cyber operations as a forcible activity and reconceptualise the cyber discourse so that cyber operations can be characterised and subject to regulation.\n\n## Types of Cyber Activity\n\nThe term \"cyber war\" completely disregards a wide variety of differing types of cyber activity and fails to appreciate the intricacies of modern state practice. In order to assess whether cyber activities can be brought into the paradigm of force one must first identify and outline the varying manifestations of cyber activity. There are four different types of cyber activities that as a result of their nature, target and intended effect can be put into the following categories: physical cyber operation; economic cyber operation; information orientated cyber operation; and cyber operation in conjunction with a military strike.\n\n## Physical Cyber Operation\n\nThe \"Original Logic Bomb\" is more of a theory than an example of a cyber operation. The theory advanced by Thomas Reed, former US National Security Official, alleges that the US used code to blow up a lucrative Russian gas pipeline in Siberia.⁶⁸ No lives were lost, however there was a significant amount of physical destruction. One could reasonably argue that this was a cyber use of force against non-military national critical infrastructure that reached the armed attack threshold.⁶⁹ However, there has been an insufficient amount of evidence to prove\n\n⁶⁸ Thomas Reed, *At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War* (New York: Random House, 2004), pp. 268–269; Emily Crawford, *Identifying the Enemy: Civilian Participation in Armed Conflict* (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2015), p. 127; Brian Mazanec and Bradley Thayer, *Deterring Cyber Warfare: Bolstering Strategic Stability in Cyberspace* (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 18\n\n⁶⁹ Roscini, *supra* note 37, p. 53; Harold Hongju Koh, “International Law in Cyberspace” (2012)",

Stuxnet, officially referred to as “Operation Olympic Games” was a seven year cyber operation spanning from 2005 to 2012 that was collaboratively devised by both the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities and their nuclear weapons development programme. Stuxnet was a “game-changer”⁷¹ that took “computer sabotage to an entirely new level”⁷² because the cyber operation changed rotor speed in the centrifuges of Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. In 2010, after “successfully damaging Iranian centrifuges”⁷³ the US-Israeli use of “weaponised code”⁷⁴ was discovered when an Iranian scientist unexpectedly connected his laptop to the infected nuclear reactor in which Stuxnet was hiding. Stuxnet then spread itself onto the internet and was rapidly discovered all over central Asian network systems and warranted the development of new anti-viral software by Microsoft. Stuxnet has been deemed the “Hiroshima of cyber-war.”⁷⁵\n\nThe Obama Administration viewed “Operation Olympic Games” as the only way in which they could appropriately address the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon and the seemingly insatiable desire of the Netanyahu Administration to use military force against Iran.⁷⁶ Netanyahu would disagree, but arguably Stuxnet was a successful cyber operation as it prevented the Iranians from developing nuclear warheads and culminated in a treaty with Iran.⁷⁷ Furthermore, one could argue that Stuxnet was the catalyst for the treaty between Iran and the US, which prevents Iran from producing or acquiring “highly enriched uranium or plutonium for at least 15 years.”⁷⁸ Some members of the International Group of Experts were\n\nUSCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference, p. 595; Mazanec and Thayer, supra note 27, p. 18\n⁷⁰ Anatoly Medetsky, “KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused ’82 Blast” The Moscow Times 18 March 2004 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html [Accessed 15 February 2016]; Rid, supra note 17, pp. 4–7, 10\n⁷¹ David Sanger, Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power (New York: Broadway Paperbacks, 2012), p. 208\n⁷² Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n⁷³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 32\n⁷⁴ Rid, supra note 17, p. 42\n⁷⁵ Michael Johnathon Gross, “A Declaration of Cyber-War” Vanity Fair April 2011 http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104 [Accessed 30 October 2015]; Rid, supra note 17, p. xiv\n⁷⁶ Sanger, supra note 71, p. 208; Joshua Mitnick, “Netanyahu Calls Iran Deal ‘Historic Mistake’” Wall Street Journal 14 July 2015 http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahu-calls-iran-deal-historic-mistake-1436866617 [Accessed 14 July 2015]; Steve Weizman, “PM Says Israel Not Bound By Iran Deal, Will Defend Itself” Yahoo News 14 July 2015 http://www.news.yahoo.com/iran-deal-historic-mistake-world-netanyahu-084341909.html [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁷ David Sanger and Michael Gordon, “Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Built on Verification’, Obama Says” New York Times 14 July 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html?_r=0 [Accessed 14 July 2015]\n⁷⁸ Sanger and Gordon, supra note 77",

Estonia, a state that was formerly a part of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, moved a Russian statue—the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn—commemorating the Russian contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II from a central location to a region in the outskirts of Estonia on the actual date assigned in the Russian calendar to commemorating the victory of Allied Forces. Russians and Estonians of Russian descent were offended by this political act; the devastating cyber operation that followed had undeniable political underpinnings. At the time of the attacks, the then Estonian Foreign Minister claimed that \"the European Union [was] under attack because Russia is attacking Estonia.\"\n\nThe cyber operation conducted on Estonia did not cause any physical damage;83 nonetheless, disruptive cyber operations can amount to uses of force, providing that the disruptive effect is significant enough to effect the functioning of critical infrastructure such as: national economic security, public safety, and the availability\n\n79 Jonathan Fildes, “Stuxnet Work ‘Targeted High-Value Iranian Assets’” BBC News 23 September 2010 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018 [Accessed 20 June 2012]\n80 Mary Ellen O’Connell, “Cyber Security Without Cyber War” 17 (2012) J.L.C. p. 201; Louise Arimatsu, “Classifying Cyber Warfare” in Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchanan (ed.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2015) p. 330; Schmitt, supra note 26, s. 13 rule 15\n81 Jaak Aaviksoo, “Cyberattacks Against Estonia Raised Awareness of Cyberthreats” (2010) 3 D.A.T.R. pp. 13–22\n82 Rid, supra note 17, p. 31\n83 Katherine Hinkle, “Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry About” (2011) 37 Y.J.I.L 11, pp. 13–14",

    "ADEO FRASER\n\n## Cyber Operation in Conjunction with Military Attack\n\nIn 2007, Israel conducted a military operation against Syria that used cyber force in conjunction with military force, to destroy a Syrian nuclear reactor. The cyber element of the operation neutralised the Syrian radar site by disabling their air defence system. It is highly likely that there was a successful Israeli cyber operation that immediately preceded the bombing of the nuclear reactor.⁹² The Israeli cyber operation essentially facilitated a successful military strike. Moreover, the cyber operation in and of itself achieved military objectives that would previously have required a military strike; it both demoralised the enemy to such an extent that they discontinued their nuclear enrichment programme and neutralised the threat posed by Syrian air defence batteries.⁹³ Thus, if the cyber use of force was not utilised in conjunction with a military strike, one could make a legitimate argument that disabling a State's air defence systems either amounts to an armed attack, or gives rise to the inherent right to anticipatory self-defence where the cyber operation preludes the armed attack.⁹⁴\n\n## Cyber Rhetoric vs Cyber Reality\n\nState practice and military manuals such as the UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict 2004,⁹⁵ the German Military Manual,⁹⁶ and the 1997 US President's certification⁹⁷ evidence the fact that states do not in practice regard low-intensity engagements \"as armed conflicts unless they reach a certain level of intensity.\"⁹⁸ States, and the Security Council, typically distinguish between situations that they perceive to be armed conflicts and limited uses of armed force that they treat as \"border clashes\", \"skirmishes\" and \"incidents\".⁹⁹ In order to appreciate the variety of cyber operations available to states, the international community must recognise that international law as it stands only effectively regulates \"most grave\" cyber uses of force.\n\nStuxnet and the Estonian cyber operations are examples of the problems emanating out of international cyber regulation, and are examples of the kind of cyber force that states are facing. These cyber operations highlight the importance of recharacterising the cyber discourse and developing a separate cyber framework as if the scope of art. 2(4) was broadened beyond armed force, the victim states may well\n\n⁹² Rid, supra note 17, pp. 42–43\n⁹³ Rid, supra note 17, p. 34\n⁹⁴ Roscini, supra note 37, p. 107\n⁹⁵ “The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict” (2004) p. 29 http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf [Accessed 30 August 2015]\n⁹⁶ German Ministry of Defence, “Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict”, s. 214\n⁹⁷ Derek Grimes, John Rawcliffe and Jeannine Smith (eds), Operational Law Handbook (2006), p. 20 http://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/law2006.pdf [Accessed 30 October 2015]\n⁹⁸ “Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law”, in ILA, Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague, 2010), p. 3\n⁹⁹ ibid, pp. 26–27",

The term “cyber war” therefore fails to appreciate the fact that cyber operations must reach a “certain level of intensity” in order to trigger an armed conflict. The failure of international law to effectively regulate low intensity cyber operations is fostering a culture, rather a cyber shadow, in which states seek to use cyber operations as an instrument of national policy.\n\n## The Grey Area, Otherwise Known as “The Cyber Shadows”\n\n## Inadequacy of the Current Legal Framework\n\nThere is currently one treaty that specifically and expressly addresses cyber activities. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁰⁰ came into force in 2004 and addresses how states regulate and criminalize cyber operations committed by nationals or originating from their territory. The Convention however neither addresses nor applies to inter-state cyber operations. “Oddly, this void in international law is unique to cyberspace”¹⁰¹ as international law normally reacts to new domains of warfare by developing “domain-specific guidance in some form of treaty or convention.”¹⁰² Nonetheless, there has been an “interpretive reorientation”¹⁰³ of the jus ad bellum and jus in bello framework to embrace cyber technology; the UN¹⁰⁴, US¹⁰⁵, UK¹⁰⁶, Russian Federation¹⁰⁷ and China¹⁰⁸ have all recognised that the law of armed conflict and the law on the use of force are applicable to cyber operations. Therefore, the international community has taken steps to ensure that states cannot conduct certain types of cyber operations without restriction.¹⁰⁹\n\nExisting treaties, customary international law, and the Tallinn Manual provide a theoretical foundation upon which the international community can begin to regulate inter-state cyber operations that reach the level of an armed attack. But this is not enough as to date there has been no recorded cyber operation that has crossed the armed attack threshold.

The comprehensive international legal regulation of the top end of the cyber force spectrum casts a dark and menacing shadow upon the plethora of cyber options at the lower end of the spectrum, that international law fails to effectively regulate: “[i]n fact, the lack of international norms, laws, and definitions to govern State actions in cyberspace has led to a grey area that can be exploited by aggressive States as long as their actions skirt the imprecise thresholds contained in the UN charter.”¹¹³ The disproportionate focus on most grave cyber uses of force is evident from the absence of a black letter definition for cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. This has created a dangerous legal grey area that has provided states with a cyber-shadow within which they can use force to achieve national policy. It is only a matter of time before a state responds to a cyber use of force with a military strike. As things stand, international law is merely deterring States from employing cyber operations which amount to armed attacks or uses of force. International law must bring uses of cyber coercion out of the proverbial cyber shadows and into the light of the paradigm of force.\n\n## II.

Cyber weapons are cheaper and more readily available than nuclear weapons, and it is for these reasons that there is a real possibility that cyber operations will become destructive. Arguably the worst is yet to come as the international community is yet to see cyber force in its most ruthless form —cyber operation that reaches the armed attack threshold.¹²¹ The nature of force has evolved and the legal framework regulating force needs to evolve also. Cyber activity in the context of international relations needs to be brought into the paradigm of force.

They’re going to be costly.

North Korea believed that the US used Sony Pictures Entertainment, the American subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, to launch a provocative attack on the dignity and legitimacy of the leadership of North Korea. North Korea deemed “The Interview” to be undisguised terrorism and an act of war that warranted both a UN complaint and “a merciless response.”¹²³ The graphic killing of a sitting foreign leader is both new and highly controversial territory for a major studio movie.¹²⁴ Although the movie was an intentionally offensive affront aimed at Kim Jong-un’s dictatorship, the film was at most propaganda and not an “act of war”.

Some have argued that the cyber operation amounted to an armed attack and thereby permitted the US to respond with force.¹³² For example, US Senator John McCain, who is responsible for the oversight and funding of the US Department of Defense, referred to the cyber operation as an act of war.¹³³ However, President Obama has publicly stated that the US does not deem the malicious cyber operation to have either reached the armed attack threshold or have been a cyber use of force. The US President has instead chosen to characterise the cyber operation as “an act of cybervandalism.”¹³⁴ The cyber operation falls in the categories of both an information-orientated cyber operation and a disruptive cyber operation. The Sony Picture’s cyber operation would also fall into the economic cyber operation category as it caused significant quantifiable and reputational damages. In spite of the fact that this information-orientated cyber operation involved the unauthorised acquisition of sensitive information it did not reach the use of force threshold. Furthermore, as the damage and disruption was suffered by a non-state actor and did not pertain to national critical infrastructure, the level of damage sustained in said operation, was not substantial enough to render the cyber operation either a cyber use of force or a cyber use of force amounting to an armed attack. In order to prevent states from abusing the limitations of international law, we must bring this cyber operation into the use of force paradigm by characterising it as a use of cyber coercion.\n\nThe reality of cyberspace is that given the complexity of the nature of cyber operations, attribution is a major obstacle as it is typically incredibly challenging to establish a connection between the private groups mounting malicious cyber operations and the states that employ them.¹³⁵ The source of a cyber operation is crucial because it dictates the way in which states are permitted by international law to respond, and also affects the legal justification that the victim state will use to qualify its chosen response. According to art. 8 of the International Law Commission’s Article on State Responsibility, the cyber operation can only be attributed to North Korea if North Korea either directed and controlled said operation, or acknowledged and claimed responsibility for it in the future.¹³⁶ In spite of the fact that North Korea has denied responsibility, attribution does not seem to be in issue in this case. The precedent setting official presidential attribution of the Sony Pictures cyber operation to the government of North Korea would seem to indicate that the US has sufficient evidence in its possession\n\n¹³² Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³³ Laughland and Rushe, supra note 125; Schmitt, supra note 126\n¹³⁴ Candy Crowley, “Interview with Barck Obama: Sony Hack was not an Act of War” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCu6-m1yag [Accessed on 10 June 2015]; Rory Carroll, “US May put North Korea Back on State Terror List After Sony ‘Cybervandalism’” The Guardian 21 December 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/21/obama-us-north-korea-state-terror-list-sony-hack [Accessed 20 August 2015]\n¹³⁵ Michael Schmitt, “Below the Threshold” Cyber Operations: The Countermeasures Response Option and International Law” (2014) 54 VJ.LL 712\n¹³⁶ Article 8 ILC’s Articles of Responsibility 2001",

Hence, the US was entitled to respond to the malicious cyber operation with limited, necessary and proportionate countermeasures.¹⁴⁵ The countermeasures would be limited to a mandate of inducing North Korea to stop conducting, or permitting cyber operations to be conducted from their territory and to resume compliance with international law, not to exact revenge.¹⁴⁶ The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility¹⁴⁷ indicate a preference for countermeasures that are reciprocal, such as a \"hack back\" against North Korean cyber assets, as a countermeasure is more likely to be proportionate, and consequently, lawful when there is a close relationship between the nature of the breach and countermeasure.\n\nDomestic law, especially domestic criminal law, is a crucial tool for combating malicious cyber operations emanating from both within and outside of a state's international borders. Hathaway et al have criticised the scope of US domestic law, as there are limitations to the extraterritorial scope of US criminal law to malicious cyber operations.¹⁴⁸ However, there have been improvements in recent years; in 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage, computer hacking and other offences. US Attorney, Western District Pennsylvania David Hickton, Stated that \"[h]acking, spying and cyber theft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally, even when the defendants are State actors.\"¹⁴⁹ Therefore, the US may well take lawful measures under domestic law against both North Korea and those individuals involved in the Sony Picture's cyber operation.\n\nUnilateral sanctions are a form of economic, diplomatic or political pressure that usually manifest in the form of trade sanctions such as boycotts and embargoes, travel bans, banking restrictions and the withdrawal of cooperation.¹⁵⁰ Unilateral\n\net Avant que le Portugal ne Participât à la Guerre (Port. v.

Moreover, in spite of the fact that international law does not permit the use of countermeasure operations against non-state actors, it may well be justifiable when characterised as a countermeasure against the state from which the cyber operation emanated.¹⁵⁵ Furthermore, the US may have a separate legal justification for conducting cyber operations against North Korea. When states fail to exercise due diligence in regulating and controlling cyber operations being launched from their territory by non-state actors, injured states may be entitled to take countermeasures designed to compel the state in question to put an end to those activities. If the cyber operation was not legally attributable to North Korea, under the law of state responsibility, North Korea may nevertheless have breached its obligation to ensure that cyber operations carried out on North Korean territory do not cause harm to other states. Hence, on account of North Korea's failure to honour and discharge its due diligence obligations, the US would have been entitled to engage in countermeasures against North Korea.¹⁵⁶\n\nNATO leaders have agreed that a military response to a large-scale cyber operation that causes significant damage, injury, destruction or loss of life may well be legally permissible providing that the scale and effects of the cyber operation are comparable to either an armed attack or use of force by orthodox non-cyber\n\nMarossi and Marisa R.

Keith Alexander’s comments to the Senate Armed Services Committee in his capacity as commander of US Cyber Command, one can infer that states can deter major and malicious state-on-state cyber operations by threatening a military response.¹⁵⁹ Which echoes the 2011 declaration of, William Lynn III, former Deputy Defense Strategy: “[t]he United States reserves the right...to respond to serious cyber attacks with a proportional and justified military response at the time and place of its choosing.”¹⁶⁰ The Sony Pictures cyber operation was predominantly an information-orientated cyber operation with economic and disruptive elements. Therefore, given that it is difficult to envisage an information orientated cyber operation that amounts to a use of force, the Sony Pictures cyber operation could not have warranted a military response.\n\nHowever, the fact that a state is legally entitled to use its military to take countermeasures will not dictate whether limited military force is necessitated: “[t]here is an assumption out there ... that a cyberattack that had destructive effects would be met by a cyber response that had destructive effects ... That’s not necessarily the case.”¹⁶¹ This position was reaffirmed by President Obama at the G7 Summit in Germany 2015, where he promised that the US would adopt a “much more aggressive”¹⁶² attitude towards malicious cyber operations. Aggression and force are two sides of the same coin, thus perhaps President Obama is indirectly emphasising a willingness to consider kinetic responses to future malicious cyber operations. However, the mere fact that a state may be entitled to take military countermeasures does not mean that a state necessarily should opt to use its military to take those countermeasures.

International law is unique in that it provides fertile soil in which “the disruptive potential of events meets directly with an imperative”¹⁶⁵ to contain, overcome, and incorporate the event. The event is predicated upon the existence of structural fragility, as a result of this structural fragility the event “displaces the configuration of being”¹⁶⁶ and a “new truth” emerges. The eruption of the event implies the absence of a certain international law, in spite of this critical instability international law imposes limits on the event. It is this very instability that is tantamount to development.¹⁶⁷ International legal history dictates that there is a process through which events disrupt the previously established framework, prior to becoming a part of the evolutionary narrative of international law and embraced as constitutive of the contemporary international legal order.¹⁶⁸ The event in international law enshrines the new standard against which states will be assessed, by accentuating the event's centrality to progression and the events ability to shape the behaviour of states. Arguably, the international community have indolently surrendered a large portion of their norm creating authority to the event, because the event is an obvious platform for international legal norm creation and regulation.¹⁶⁹\n\nInternational law is restricted by both the international community's disavowal of the event and its two dimensional attitude towards the event. The event confronts international law in a contradictory way, it emphasises the remaining possibility for the continual operation of instability in events, “even after their ostensible containment by international law.”¹⁷⁰ The international community needs to find a way to emancipate the event from its primary limitation, experience.¹⁷¹ The event\n\n¹⁶³ Eichensehr, supra note 157\n¹⁶⁴ Frederic Megret, “The Liberation of Nelson Mandela: Anatomy of a ‘Happy Event’” in International Law in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 129\n¹⁶⁵ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁶ Emilios Christodoulidis, “Political Trials as Events” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 141\n¹⁶⁷ Sundhya Pahuja, “Decolonization and the Eventness of International Law” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed.), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 102\n¹⁶⁸ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 3–4\n¹⁶⁹ Johns, supra note 119, pp. 7–8\n¹⁷⁰ Johns, supra note 119, p. 4\n¹⁷¹ Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, “Absolute Contingency and the Prescriptive Force of International Law, Chiapas-Valladoild, ca. 1550” in Fleur Johns, Richard Joyce and Sundhya Pahjua (ed), Events: The Force of International Law (London: Routledge, 2011), p. 41",

However, there is room for an event that is not governed by necessity, a “true event”.¹⁷² This “true event”, for Guardiola-Riviera, is the prescriptive force of international law, which in his opinion is a stronger foundation for true political and ethical action.¹⁷³\n\nCyber operations are not being effectively regulated and monitored by the *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* legal framework. Cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion are the most common manifestations of inter-state cyber activity. Nonetheless, there are no substantive international legal provisions that either regulate or define cyber operations of this nature. It is safe to say that there is definite cyber law structural fragility in international law, rendering cyber space as ripe for an unprecedented and potentially destructive cyber event: “[e]very now and then we get events that seem to have popped out of an alternative dimension.”¹⁷⁴ A cyber event would undeniably serve as a precursor to substantive legal implementation and cyber regulation; however the international community can no longer wait for the tremors of an event to reverberate through the international legal system before it seeks to address the cyber structural fragility in international law, and brings cyber operations into the paradigm of force.\n\n## Formalisation, Standardisation and the Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact\n\n“Formalisation” and “standardisation” are the cornerstone of the contemporary international legal system, and the concept of progress is pervasive in international law’s modes of thinking, language and history.¹⁷⁵ For Skouteris, formalisation and standardisation are tantamount to progress in that they “actively create discursive space”¹⁷⁶ for a given doctrine to be “accepted as an element of progress by telling a story about international law’s past, present and future.”¹⁷⁷ Formalisation and standardisation in tandem possess the ability to bring certainty, formalism and stability to the law pertaining to cyber operations and more specifically cyber uses of force.

    "From the Kalashnikov to the Keyboard\n111\n\nThe international legal regulation of cyber force solely addresses cyber operations that amount to an armed attack and cause significant destruction. However, the reality of the cyber landscape is that there are a plethora of alternative cyber options available to states that international law has failed to pay attention to. A cause for concern is that a lack of substantive regulation has enabled states to develop their cyber capabilities and provided an ideal climate for cyber uses of force to become more destructive over time. Stuxnet is testament to this fact. International law must develop a technique, standard or tool capable of enabling the \"correctness\" or legitimacy of cyber operations to be determined decisively.¹⁷⁹ \"A mystified opposition between a primitive past and an advanced present/future becomes the interpretative device for understanding doctrinal progress (correctness, determinacy, social relevance)\",¹⁸⁰ cyber progress for international law will only be achieved through a transition from \"fragmentation to standardization\",¹⁸¹ from \"academic formalism to pragmatism\"¹⁸² and from politics to process.\n\nIt appears futile to condemn cyber conflict, or attempt to eradicate the inevitable transition into this period's peculiar form of war. Rather, international law must outlaw cyber war as an instrument of national and international policy. Arts 2(4) and 51 are not in need of revision, they were designed to address the use of interstate armed force. Hence international law needs a new framework that unlike arts 2(4) and 51, is specifically drafted to address cyber uses of force. If states refused to become parties to a proposed treaty, the framework could be styled upon the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and take the form of soft law. There are many similarities between the contemporary regulation of cyber uses of force and the early nineteenth century regulation of uses of force. The Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 was officially entitled the \"General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\".\n\nThe principle underlying the Kellogg-Briand Pact was that it embodied \"the creation of machinery for the settlement of disputes and for the stigmatizing certain wars as illegal and the concerting of collective action against a State initiating an illegal war.\"¹⁸³ Essentially, the Kellogg-Briand Pact revolutionised the use of interstate force and was the point at which the international law decided that war was illegal in principle.¹⁸⁴ The fact that the Pact had a record number of Contracting Parties for that period reflects the devastation of its preceding event—the Great War—and the retrospective acknowledgment of debilitated states, that the use of inter-state force was insufficiently regulated in international law.¹⁸⁵ International law needs a Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact.\n\n¹⁷⁹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 75\n¹⁸⁰ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 78\n¹⁸¹ Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸² Skouteris, supra note 175, p. 77\n¹⁸³ Arnold D McNair, \"Collective Security\" (1936) 17 B.Y.B.I.L 155\n¹⁸⁴ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84\n¹⁸⁵ Dinstein, supra note 41, p. 84",
    "ADEO FRASER\n\nAdmittedly the Kellogg-Briand Pact was not without its problems. The treaty's main weaknesses were that it failed to address self-defence, failed to incorporate agreed upon parameters on the legitimacy of war as an instrument of international policy, failed to embrace non-signatories, and failed to address uses of force short of war.¹⁸⁶ However, a “Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact” could have as big an impact as its predecessor because it is perfectly situated to learn from the mistakes of its predecessor. This Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact could potentially address these weaknesses by forbidding the use of cyber operations as both an instrument of national and international policy, compelling signatories to abide by the articles contained in their international relations, prohibiting cyber operations that reach the armed attack threshold, defining a cyber use of force and a use of cyber coercion, outlining the circumstances that a state is entitled to conduct uses of cyber coercion, namely right to take countermeasures, clarifying the nature of the response options available to victim States, and forbidding the use of military force in response to cyber uses of force and uses of cyber coercion. The standardisation and formalisation of the above would create legal certainty, address structural fragility in this area of law and most importantly, stimulate the creation of new and improved laws pertaining to cyber operations without the need for a destructive event.¹⁸⁷ A Cyber Kellogg-Briand Pact is needed, before it gets too late and the damage caused by malicious cyber operations warrants a Charter of the United Cyber Nations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyber development cannot be stimulated whilst rhetorical shackles inhibit an emerging branch of international law from progression. The Stuxnet cyber operation confirmed not only that there can be a cyber use of force but that States have the capability to conduct cyber uses of force. Cyber operations such as Stuxnet and the Israeli 2007 military-cyber operation are clear indications that the time for political rhetoric is over, and that cyber operations must be seen as weapons capable of destruction. The *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* do not regulate cyber force. Frankly, they regulate a microcosm of the cyber options available to states. Art. 2(4) is not a general framework for dealing with all forcible behaviour, rather art. 2(4) and its sister provision were drafted to address armed force.\n\nThe Sony Pictures cyber operation is a potent example of the ineffective regulation of more common types of cyber operations. Cyber operations such as the Sony Pictures operation, which have been referred to as “uses of cyber coercion”, are dangerous because familiarity breeds contempt. As states get more comfortable with the cyber landscape, they will become more comfortable with using cyber force.

The international community needs to recognise that the face of belligerence is changing; instead of allowing cyber operations to increase in their severity over time, the international community must facilitate the creation of a new cyber orientated legal framework. The name and shame culture that the US appears to be developing may well be one of the first steps towards regulating inter-state uses of cyber force and bringing cyberspace into the paradigm of force.\n\n¹⁸⁸ President Barack Obama, “Remarks by President Obama in Press Conference after G7 Summit” (8 June 2015) http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/08/remarks-president-obama-press-conference-after-g7-summit [Accessed 9 September 2015]"
