As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security.¹ Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace,² most scholars consider this unrealistic.³ There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality.⁴ This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue. International law, including international humanitarian law (IHL), primarily governs the\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\n1. M.N. Schmitt and S.

For example, some non-State groups solely have a virtual existence – group members do not meet frequently, they do not have formal hierarchies or command structures, and the entire coordination of their activities is conducted on the internet. Notably, cyber operations conducted by such groups have so far been safely below the severity required for the Geneva Conventions to be even remotely relevant. As such, the topic of this article – the question of how such virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict – and thus, trigger the application of IHL – is, admittedly, of a hypothetical nature. However, developments in the cyber realm tend to happen at a faster pace than in the traditionally conservative realm of law. Thus, there is good reason to explore the plasticity in our legal norms to predict their suitability for the regulation of new types of actors with different characteristics.\nThe focus of the article is on the application of the triggering provisions in IHL to a new type of actors existing in cyberspace, rather than to a new type of weaponry. In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n⁵ Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a \"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of \"protracted armed violence\" taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack.

Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs\nThe text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict \"not of an international character\".¹² As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict.¹³ The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State.¹⁴ Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.¹⁵ As such, the provision has\n¹⁰ M.M.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed\n¹⁶ Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n¹⁷ Ibid 1152.\n¹⁸ ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n¹⁹ Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n335\ngroup and a State, prima facie resembling a NIAC, may turn international if the armed group is acting on behalf of a State. The imperative question is what degree of authority or control must be wielded by a State over armed forces fighting on its behalf in order to trigger an IAC.²⁰ This question became relevant for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) when it had to determine whether the regime of grave breaches under IHL, only applicable in IACS, applied to the war crimes committed by Tadić, a prison guard in a Bosnian Serb prison camp. As such, the Appeals Chamber had to determine whether the prima facie non-international conflict between the Bosnian Muslims, the Croats and the Serbs would turn international because of the involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the conflict. The ICTY found that this question should be informed by Article 4A of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 (GCIII), establishing when members of militias or paramilitary groups may obtain combatant status. The provision implies that members of such groups may obtain combatant status if the group belongs to a State, provided that certain additional requirements are fulfilled. The ICTY found that the term “belonging to” implicitly refers to a test of control. However, it did not find any relevant criteria in IHL for establishing when a group of individuals was under such control.²¹ Because of the lack of specific rules, the court found it necessary to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals laid down in general international law. The ICTY found this notion in the customary rules on State responsibility, which set out the legal criteria for attributing acts of non-State actors to a State.²² According to the ICTY, logically, the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State must be the same, regardless of whether the question at stake is about attributing acts of the individual to the State for the purpose of State responsibility, or about determining whether non-State actors act as de facto State officials, rendering a conflict international.\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the\n20 Prosecutor v Duško Tadić, 15 July 1999, ICTY, Appeals Chamber Judgment, para. 97.\n21 Ibid para. 98.\n22 Ibid para. 99, 105.\n23 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, 27 July 1986, ICJ, Judgment on the merits, para. 109.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

For individuals, and for groups that are not militarily organized, it is necessary to prove not only that the State exercised some measure of authority over those individuals but also that it issued specific instructions to them concerning the performance of the acts at issue, or that it ex post facto publicly endorsed those acts.³⁰ In contrast, for individuals making up an organized and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels, it suffices to prove that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. The ICTY elaborates that this comprises more than the mere provision of financial assistance or military equipment or training, but does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation.³¹ As such, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts.³² With this approach, the level of organization of the armed group becomes vital for the degree of involvement required from a State over the group before the actions of the group can trigger an IAC.\nIn the case of Genocide, the ICJ rejects the conceptual basis on which the ICTY has built its argumentation, as it finds that logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the question of State involvement required to establish State responsibility and the question of State involvement in an armed conflict for the conflict to be characterized as international.³³ Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility.³⁴ As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n³⁵ MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n339\nof activities take place in virtual groups; with the words of professor in anthropology Gabriella Coleman:\nCooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners. ... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.³⁶\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict.³⁷ The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n³⁶ G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n³⁷ ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\ncriterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies.³⁸ The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on\n³⁸ Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n341\nCA3, the manual states the rationale behind the requirement on organization is that it must be possible for the group to comply with IHL. No other possible rationales for organization are explicitly considered (although some of the indicating factors taken into consideration in the assessment of the organization requirement indeed point to other rationales). However, in fact, not only one but three possible rationales for an organization requirement can be deduced from the text of the Convention and identified in the practice of international tribunals. The rationales are reflected in different indicative factors for organization.\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity.³⁹ The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree.⁴⁰ The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold.⁴¹ The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.”⁴² Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization.⁴³ Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n³⁹ Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n⁴⁰ S.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n343\nheadquarters; the control of territory; and the ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.⁵¹ If emphasis is placed on those indicative factors, networked and virtual groups are unlikely to be considered sufficiently organized to constitute a party, and thereby to meet the criterion on organization.\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides.⁵² This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3.⁵³ The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”.⁵⁴ CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality.⁵⁵ The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe,⁵⁶ and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL.⁵⁷ The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group.⁵⁸ Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n⁵¹ Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n⁵² Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n⁵³ Ibid 177.\n⁵⁴ International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n⁵⁵ R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group.⁵⁹ Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n⁵⁹ Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n345\nreason, the plasticity of the requirement is presumably limited. Moreover, interestingly, all three rationales behind the organization requirement in CA3 are reflected in the wording of APII. Thus, the requirement on organization appears to be highly similar in the two provisions, albeit their legal bases are different. For the reasons stated in section 4.1, and due to the safe legal basis in the text of the Convention, there is no room for reinterpretation of the organization requirement in APII, Article 1(1).\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates.⁶⁰ This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act.⁶¹ An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group.⁶² Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n⁶⁰ Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n347\nthe organization requirement for non-State actors for the applicability of the test of overall control should be affected.\n# 5 Conclusion\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",

As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security. Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace, most scholars consider this unrealistic. There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality. This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue.

In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a \"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of \"protracted armed violence\" taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack. The legal\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348</http:>\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\nregulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with APII, which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties, but which also contains higher criteria for its application. To conclude, the classification of a conflict remains the first step in any analysis under IHL. Section 2.1 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of NIACs, i.e. CA3 and APII, Article 1. Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs\nThe text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict \"not of an international character\". As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict. The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State. Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords. As such, the provision has\n M.M. Bradley, ‘Additional Protocol II: Elevating the Minimum Threshold of Intensity?’ 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), p. 1131.\n M.N.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties. However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3. Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case. Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority. The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed\n Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n Ibid 1152.\n ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group. In broad terms, the\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf. The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State. If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above, the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive. Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n Ibid 109–110; M. Milanovic, ‘State Responsibility for Genocide’ 17 European Journal of International Law (2006) p. 553, 577; M.

Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility. As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n Ibid 118, 137.\n Ibid 137.\n Ibid 121, 131.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born. Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nCooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners. ... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict. The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\ncriterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies. The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on\n Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity. The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree. The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold. The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.” Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization. Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n S. Sivakumaran, The Law of Non-International Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press 2012).\n ICRC, supra note 6, para. 414 et seq.\n Committee on the Use of Force, International Law Association, Initial Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, (2008) p. 22; R.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides. This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3. The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”. CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality. The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe, and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL. The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group. Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n Ibid 177.\n International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group. Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates. This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act. An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group. Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n# 5 Conclusion\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",

While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a\"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail.

The legal NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348</http:> VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with APII, which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties, but which also contains higher criteria for its application.¹⁰ To conclude, the classification of a conflict remains the first step in any analysis under IHL.¹¹ Section 2.1 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of NIACs, i.e. CA3 and APII, Article 1.

In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict.¹³ The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State.¹⁴ Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.¹⁵ As such, the provision has ¹⁰ M.M.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires\"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed ¹⁶ Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n¹⁷ Ibid 1152.\n¹⁸ ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n¹⁹ Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS This approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN judgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶ In the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control ²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN Since then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.",
    "## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups As section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination ³⁵ MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.": "NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS Cooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners.... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.³⁶ Thus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict.³⁷ The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization ³⁶ G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n³⁷ ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN criterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.",
    "## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?": "International legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies.³⁸ The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3 As is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on ³⁸ Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity.³⁹ The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree.⁴⁰ The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold.⁴¹ The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.”⁴² Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization.⁴³ Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n³⁹ Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n⁴⁰ S.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides.⁵² This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3.⁵³ The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”.⁵⁴ CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality.⁵⁵ The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe,⁵⁶ and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL.⁵⁷ The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group.⁵⁸ Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n⁵¹ Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n⁵² Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n⁵³ Ibid 177.\n⁵⁴ International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n⁵⁵ R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group.⁵⁹ Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n⁵⁹ Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates.⁶⁰ This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act.⁶¹ An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group.⁶² Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n⁶⁰ Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS",
    "# 5 Conclusion": "This article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348"

As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security. Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace, most scholars consider this unrealistic. There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality. This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue.

In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a \"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of \"protracted armed violence\" taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack. The legal\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348</http:>\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\nregulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with APII, which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties, but which also contains higher criteria for its application. To conclude, the classification of a conflict remains the first step in any analysis under IHL. Section 2.1 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of NIACs, i.e. CA3 and APII, Article 1. Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs\nThe text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict \"not of an international character\". As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict. The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State. Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords. As such, the provision has\n M.M. Bradley, ‘Additional Protocol II: Elevating the Minimum Threshold of Intensity?’ 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), p. 1131.\n M.N.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties. However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3. Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case. Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority. The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed\n Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n Ibid 1152.\n ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group. In broad terms, the\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf. The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State. If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above, the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive. Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n Ibid 109–110; M. Milanovic, ‘State Responsibility for Genocide’ 17 European Journal of International Law (2006) p. 553, 577; M.

Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility. As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n Ibid 118, 137.\n Ibid 137.\n Ibid 121, 131.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born. Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nCooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners. ... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict. The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\ncriterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies. The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on\n Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity. The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree. The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold. The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.” Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization. Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n S. Sivakumaran, The Law of Non-International Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press 2012).\n ICRC, supra note 6, para. 414 et seq.\n Committee on the Use of Force, International Law Association, Initial Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, (2008) p. 22; R.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides. This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3. The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”. CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality. The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe, and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL. The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group. Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n Ibid 177.\n International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group. Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates. This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act. An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group. Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n# 5 Conclusion\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",

As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security. Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace, most scholars consider this unrealistic. There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality. This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue.

In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a \"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of \"protracted armed violence\" taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack. The legal\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348</http:>\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\nregulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with APII, which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties, but which also contains higher criteria for its application. To conclude, the classification of a conflict remains the first step in any analysis under IHL. Section 2.1 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of NIACs, i.e. CA3 and APII, Article 1. Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs\nThe text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict \"not of an international character\". As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict. The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State. Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords. As such, the provision has\n M.M. Bradley, ‘Additional Protocol II: Elevating the Minimum Threshold of Intensity?’ 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), p. 1131.\n M.N.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties. However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3. Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case. Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority. The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed\n Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n Ibid 1152.\n ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group. In broad terms, the\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf. The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State. If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above, the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive. Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n Ibid 109–110; M. Milanovic, ‘State Responsibility for Genocide’ 17 European Journal of International Law (2006) p. 553, 577; M.

Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility. As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n Ibid 118, 137.\n Ibid 137.\n Ibid 121, 131.\n Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born. Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nCooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners. ... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict. The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\ncriterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies. The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on\n Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity. The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree. The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold. The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.” Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization. Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n S.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides. This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3. The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”. CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality. The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe, and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL. The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group. Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n Ibid 177.\n International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group. Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates. This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act. An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group. Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n# 5 Conclusion\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348"

As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security.¹ Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace,² most scholars consider this unrealistic.³ There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality.⁴ This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue. International law, including international humanitarian law (IHL), primarily governs the\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\n1. M.N. Schmitt and S.

For example, some non-State groups solely have a virtual existence – group members do not meet frequently, they do not have formal hierarchies or command structures, and the entire coordination of their activities is conducted on the internet. Notably, cyber operations conducted by such groups have so far been safely below the severity required for the Geneva Conventions to be even remotely relevant. As such, the topic of this article – the question of how such virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict – and thus, trigger the application of IHL – is, admittedly, of a hypothetical nature. However, developments in the cyber realm tend to happen at a faster pace than in the traditionally conservative realm of law. Thus, there is good reason to explore the plasticity in our legal norms to predict their suitability for the regulation of new types of actors with different characteristics.\nThe focus of the article is on the application of the triggering provisions in IHL to a new type of actors existing in cyberspace, rather than to a new type of weaponry. In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n⁵ Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a \"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of \"protracted armed violence\" taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack.

Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs\nThe text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict \"not of an international character\".¹² As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict.¹³ The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State.¹⁴ Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.¹⁵ As such, the provision has\n¹⁰ M.M.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed\n¹⁶ Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n¹⁷ Ibid 1152.\n¹⁸ ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n¹⁹ Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n335\ngroup and a State, prima facie resembling a NIAC, may turn international if the armed group is acting on behalf of a State. The imperative question is what degree of authority or control must be wielded by a State over armed forces fighting on its behalf in order to trigger an IAC.²⁰ This question became relevant for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) when it had to determine whether the regime of grave breaches under IHL, only applicable in IACS, applied to the war crimes committed by Tadić, a prison guard in a Bosnian Serb prison camp. As such, the Appeals Chamber had to determine whether the prima facie non-international conflict between the Bosnian Muslims, the Croats and the Serbs would turn international because of the involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the conflict. The ICTY found that this question should be informed by Article 4A of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 (GCIII), establishing when members of militias or paramilitary groups may obtain combatant status. The provision implies that members of such groups may obtain combatant status if the group belongs to a State, provided that certain additional requirements are fulfilled. The ICTY found that the term “belonging to” implicitly refers to a test of control. However, it did not find any relevant criteria in IHL for establishing when a group of individuals was under such control.²¹ Because of the lack of specific rules, the court found it necessary to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals laid down in general international law. The ICTY found this notion in the customary rules on State responsibility, which set out the legal criteria for attributing acts of non-State actors to a State.²² According to the ICTY, logically, the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State must be the same, regardless of whether the question at stake is about attributing acts of the individual to the State for the purpose of State responsibility, or about determining whether non-State actors act as de facto State officials, rendering a conflict international.\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the\n20 Prosecutor v Duško Tadić, 15 July 1999, ICTY, Appeals Chamber Judgment, para. 97.\n21 Ibid para. 98.\n22 Ibid para. 99, 105.\n23 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, 27 July 1986, ICJ, Judgment on the merits, para. 109.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

For individuals, and for groups that are not militarily organized, it is necessary to prove not only that the State exercised some measure of authority over those individuals but also that it issued specific instructions to them concerning the performance of the acts at issue, or that it ex post facto publicly endorsed those acts.³⁰ In contrast, for individuals making up an organized and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels, it suffices to prove that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. The ICTY elaborates that this comprises more than the mere provision of financial assistance or military equipment or training, but does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation.³¹ As such, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts.³² With this approach, the level of organization of the armed group becomes vital for the degree of involvement required from a State over the group before the actions of the group can trigger an IAC.\nIn the case of Genocide, the ICJ rejects the conceptual basis on which the ICTY has built its argumentation, as it finds that logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the question of State involvement required to establish State responsibility and the question of State involvement in an armed conflict for the conflict to be characterized as international.³³ Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility.³⁴ As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n³⁵ MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n339\nof activities take place in virtual groups; with the words of professor in anthropology Gabriella Coleman:\nCooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners. ... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.³⁶\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict.³⁷ The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n³⁶ G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n³⁷ ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\ncriterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies.³⁸ The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on\n³⁸ Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n341\nCA3, the manual states the rationale behind the requirement on organization is that it must be possible for the group to comply with IHL. No other possible rationales for organization are explicitly considered (although some of the indicating factors taken into consideration in the assessment of the organization requirement indeed point to other rationales). However, in fact, not only one but three possible rationales for an organization requirement can be deduced from the text of the Convention and identified in the practice of international tribunals. The rationales are reflected in different indicative factors for organization.\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity.³⁹ The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree.⁴⁰ The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold.⁴¹ The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.”⁴² Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization.⁴³ Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n³⁹ Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n⁴⁰ S. Sivakumaran, The Law of Non-International Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press 2012).\n⁴¹ ICRC, supra note 6, para. 414 et seq.\n⁴² Committee on the Use of Force, International Law Association, Initial Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, (2008) p. 22; R. Geiss, ‘Cyber Warfare: Implications for Non-international Armed Conflicts’, International Law Studies, U.S. Naval War College (2013). vol. 89.\n⁴³ Schmitt, supra note 35, rule 83.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nTHOGERSEN\nat much lower levels of severity than kinetic operations. However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment. As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking. What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe. Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field. Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL. The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion. On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\" With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n343\nheadquarters; the control of territory; and the ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.⁵¹ If emphasis is placed on those indicative factors, networked and virtual groups are unlikely to be considered sufficiently organized to constitute a party, and thereby to meet the criterion on organization.\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides.⁵² This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3.⁵³ The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”.⁵⁴ CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality.⁵⁵ The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe,⁵⁶ and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL.⁵⁷ The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group.⁵⁸ Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n⁵¹ Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n⁵² Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n⁵³ Ibid 177.\n⁵⁴ International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n⁵⁵ R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group.⁵⁹ Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n⁵⁹ Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n345\nreason, the plasticity of the requirement is presumably limited. Moreover, interestingly, all three rationales behind the organization requirement in CA3 are reflected in the wording of APII. Thus, the requirement on organization appears to be highly similar in the two provisions, albeit their legal bases are different. For the reasons stated in section 4.1, and due to the safe legal basis in the text of the Convention, there is no room for reinterpretation of the organization requirement in APII, Article 1(1).\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates.⁶⁰ This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act.⁶¹ An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group.⁶² Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n⁶⁰ Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid., para. 120.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n347\nthe organization requirement for non-State actors for the applicability of the test of overall control should be affected.\n# 5 Conclusion\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348"

As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security.¹ Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace,² most scholars consider this unrealistic.³ There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality.⁴ This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue. International law, including international humanitarian law (IHL), primarily governs the NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\n\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\nThe focus of the article is on the application of the triggering provisions in IHL to a new type of actors existing in cyberspace, rather than to a new type of weaponry. In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such ⁵ Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN requirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts IHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a\"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail. In particular, the NIAC regime does not provide for prisoner-of-war status and contains no equivalent to the occupation law regime. Moreover, unlike CA2, CA3 requires a level of sustained hostilities between the parties – the existence of\"protracted armed violence\"taking place within a certain defined area – before an armed conflict exists.8 As such, the same hostile conduct may trigger an IAC if perpetrated by a State against another, but might not trigger a NIAC if conducted by a non-State actor.9 This is particularly relevant in a cyber-context, where attacks often fall below the required threshold, or where there is uncertainty as to the exact scope of consequences of an attack. The legal NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348</http:> VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with APII, which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties, but which also contains higher criteria for its application.¹⁰ To conclude, the classification of a conflict remains the first step in any analysis under IHL.¹¹ Section 2.1 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of NIACs, i.e. CA3 and APII, Article 1. Section 2.2 examines the organization requirement in the legal framework for the triggering of IACs, i.e. CA2.\n## 2.1 Non-State Groups Triggering NIACs The text of CA3 defines a NIAC in the negative, as the provision simply establishes that the minimum humanitarian standards proscribed by the provision apply in the case of an armed conflict\"not of an international character\".¹² As such, the provision contains no explicit criterion or delimitation as to what type of armed group is capable of triggering a NIAC. In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict.¹³ The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State.¹⁴ Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.¹⁵ As such, the provision has ¹⁰ M.M.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires\"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed ¹⁶ Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n¹⁷ Ibid 1152.\n¹⁸ ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n¹⁹ Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS This approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN judgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶ In the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control ²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN Since then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups As section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination ³⁵ MN. Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Second edition, University Press 2017) r 87, para. 10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS Cooperation, fellowship, mutual aid, and even institution building are quotidian to the hacker experience – even among the most subversive, rule-breaking practitioners.... Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.³⁶ Thus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict.³⁷ The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization ³⁶ G. Coleman, 'From Internet Farming to Weapons of the Geek', 58 Current Anthropology (2020) p. 91.\n³⁷ ICRC, supra note 6, para. 437.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN criterion could hamper the civilian protection that the body of law was put in the world to ensure.\n## 4 Testing the Plasticity: Room for Reinterpretation of the Triggering Provisions?\nInternational legal norms necessarily evolve over time to ensure that the applicable normative architecture remains responsive to the context in which it applies.³⁸ The aim of this section is to explore how the organization requirements inherent in the triggering provisions, as examined above, could be interpreted and applied to virtual groups. It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3 As is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization. With reference to the ICRC commentary on ³⁸ Schmitt, supra note 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity.³⁹ The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree.⁴⁰ The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold.⁴¹ The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.”⁴² Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization.⁴³ Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n³⁹ Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n⁴⁰ S.

However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides.⁵² This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3.⁵³ The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”.⁵⁴ CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality.⁵⁵ The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe,⁵⁶ and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL.⁵⁷ The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group.⁵⁸ Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n⁵¹ Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n⁵² Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n⁵³ Ibid 177.\n⁵⁴ International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n⁵⁵ R.

However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group.⁵⁹ Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n⁵⁹ Coleman, supra note 46.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348\nVIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nto determine the substance of this test of control. With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates.⁶⁰ This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act.⁶¹ An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group.⁶² Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State.

To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348\nTHOGERSEN\nthe plasticity in CA2 was complicated by the intricate jurisprudential history leading to the approach now constituting state-of-the-art. However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348"

While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict. Thus, with the introduction of CA3, States agreed for the first time on regulating, in an international treaty framework, what was at the time considered by States as being exclusively their domestic affair: the non-international armed conflict (NIAC).6 Compared with the number and detail of the provisions governing international armed conflicts (IACs) in the Geneva Conventions, CA3 is far less elaborate and was already at the 1949 Diplomatic Conference described as a\"convention in miniature\".7 To a significant extent, IAC norms have now migrated into the NIAC realm, but differences still prevail.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires\"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC. Thus, an armed conflict between an armed ¹⁶ Bradley, supra note 10, p. 1131.\n¹⁷ Ibid 1152.\n¹⁸ ICRC, Commentary on Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977 (1st edn, 1987) para. 4460.\n¹⁹ Ibid 4463.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS This approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN judgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶ In the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control ²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348 THOGERSEN Since then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n\n---\n\n## # 5 Conclusion\n\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups.

    "THOGERSEN\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nCybersecurity plays an inevitable role in contemporary conflicts. As States increasingly rely on digital technology and infrastructure, their cyber vulnerabilities also increase. This makes technologically advanced States particularly vulnerable to malicious cyber operations. In general, non-State actors have emerged as central players in the cyber domain, with the capacity to mount cyber operations that can profoundly affect States' security.¹ Full-blown cyber warfare is a phenomenon that is yet to be seen, but cyber vulnerabilities are frequently exploited in the context of conflicts along with kinetic means as part of broader military strategies. In this rapidly developing landscape, it is essential to consider the legal consequences of digital warfare.\n\nWhile some have suggested the need to adopt new treaty law to ensure a legal framework that fits the new realities of cyberspace,² most scholars consider this unrealistic.³ There appears to be a consensus among the majority of States, including the Nordic States, that it is both possible and preferable to respond to the developments occurring in cyberspace through an interpretation of existing international law. Accordingly, existing international legal norms are considered to provide a sufficient regulatory framework to govern this new and rapidly changing reality.⁴ This approach requires that the current legal framework be interpreted and applied to remain responsive to the new reality occurring.\n\nThe emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue.

For example, some non-State groups solely have a virtual existence – group members do not meet frequently, they do not have formal hierarchies or command structures, and the entire coordination of their activities is conducted on the internet. Notably, cyber operations conducted by such groups have so far been safely below the severity required for the Geneva Conventions to be even remotely relevant. As such, the topic of this article – the question of how such virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict – and thus, trigger the application of IHL – is, admittedly, of a hypothetical nature. However, developments in the cyber realm tend to happen at a faster pace than in the traditionally conservative realm of law. Thus, there is good reason to explore the plasticity in our legal norms to predict their suitability for the regulation of new types of actors with different characteristics.\n\nThe focus of the article is on the application of the triggering provisions in IHL to a new type of actors existing in cyberspace, rather than to a new type of weaponry. In reality, those two assessments are connected; as this article demonstrates, the legal regulation of the actors may also depend on their capacities to do harm. Therefore, considerations regarding the capacities of virtual non-State groups are included to a limited extent where relevant, but general questions as to the prospects of cyber operations reaching particular thresholds of severity in IHL is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, and despite the fact that the majority of cyber operations have so far been safely below the level of hostilities required for the existence of an armed conflict, the article assumes that such a scenario cannot be rejected as unrealistic and that it is therefore relevant to consider how virtual groups fit into the legal framework of IHL.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. To lay the groundwork, the following section introduces the legal framework that determines when an armed conflict is triggered by a non-State group. As the section demonstrates, the triggering provisions of the four Geneva Conventions (common article 2 (CA2) and common Article 3 (CA3)) have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization, and an explicit organization requirement is contained in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII). Section 3 provides some reflections on the consequences of applying a requirement of organization to virtual groups. Concluding that virtual groups fall short of meeting such\n\n⁵ Schmitt and Watts, supra note 1.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348",
    "THOGERSEN\n\nrequirement, the foundation has been established for a scrutiny in section 4 of the plasticity of the organization requirement under the three provisions. Thus, the section dissects the legal bases for the organization requirements in the provisions to identify the underlying rationales and, on that basis, assess the relevance of the organization requirement for virtual groups. This analysis leads to a conclusion as to the possible room for reinterpretation of the legal norms due to the new reality occurring.\n\n## 2 The Legal Framework: Non-State Groups Triggering Armed Conflicts\n\nIHL regulates the conduct of hostilities and seeks to ensure a minimum level of humanitarian safeguards in conflict situations. While States have traditionally been the main international actors, including in warfare, it was recognized in the Geneva Conventions that a non-State armed group might also be a party to a conflict.

In its decision on jurisdiction in the case of Tadić, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY articulated what has now become widely accepted as a test of two criteria, namely (i) the intensity of the conflict and (ii) the organization of the parties to the conflict.¹³ The criteria were later further developed in the case law of international tribunals. It is now established that the armed group is required to have some degree of organization, but that it does not necessarily need to be as organized as the armed forces of a State.¹⁴ Indicative factors for whether a sufficient level of organization is reached include the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the control over a certain territory; the ability to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.¹⁵ As such, the provision has\n\n¹⁰ M.M.

Consequently, the organizational structure of a group is imperative for the application of CA3.\n\nThe legal regulation of NIACs has been further developed and supplemented with Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (APII), which entails more extensive obligations on the conflict parties.¹⁶ However, not all conflicts triggering a NIAC under CA3 will suffice to trigger the application of APII. First, the intensity threshold for the application of APII is higher; the application of the convention requires \"sustained and concerted military operations\", which elevates the minimum threshold of protracted armed violence in CA3.¹⁷ Second, and more relevant for the present purpose, the protocol applies in a situation where a the armed forces of a State confront dissident armed forces or fight against organized armed groups, the latter more often being the case.¹⁸ Thus, for armed groups, the provision contains an explicit requirement on organization. In addition, for both dissident armed forces and organized armed groups, the provision requires that the group operate under responsible command. This further implies some degree of organization of the insurgent armed group or dissident armed forces. While it does not necessarily require a hierarchical system of military organization similar to that of regular armed forces, the organization must be capable, on the one hand, of planning and carrying out sustained and concerted military operations, and on the other, of imposing discipline in the name of a de facto authority.¹⁹ The provision further requires that the group exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement APII.\n\nAs such, both CA3 and APII contain an organization requirement. In contrast to the organization requirement in CA3, for APII, this requirement can be deduced directly from the text of the convention.\n\n## 2.2 Non-State Groups Triggering IACs\n\nDespite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, international tribunals have accepted that the armed activities of non-State groups may also trigger an IAC.

The imperative question is what degree of authority or control must be wielded by a State over armed forces fighting on its behalf in order to trigger an IAC.²⁰ This question became relevant for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) when it had to determine whether the regime of grave breaches under IHL, only applicable in IACS, applied to the war crimes committed by Tadić, a prison guard in a Bosnian Serb prison camp. As such, the Appeals Chamber had to determine whether the prima facie non-international conflict between the Bosnian Muslims, the Croats and the Serbs would turn international because of the involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the conflict. The ICTY found that this question should be informed by Article 4A of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 (GCIII), establishing when members of militias or paramilitary groups may obtain combatant status. The provision implies that members of such groups may obtain combatant status if the group belongs to a State, provided that certain additional requirements are fulfilled. The ICTY found that the term “belonging to” implicitly refers to a test of control. However, it did not find any relevant criteria in IHL for establishing when a group of individuals was under such control.²¹ Because of the lack of specific rules, the court found it necessary to examine the notion of control by a State over individuals laid down in general international law. The ICTY found this notion in the customary rules on State responsibility, which set out the legal criteria for attributing acts of non-State actors to a State.²² According to the ICTY, logically, the conditions on which under international law an individual may be held to act as a de facto organ of a State must be the same, regardless of whether the question at stake is about attributing acts of the individual to the State for the purpose of State responsibility, or about determining whether non-State actors act as de facto State officials, rendering a conflict international.\n\nThis approach triggered a jurisprudential dispute between the ICTY and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ had previously considered the question of attribution for State responsibility in the case of Nicaragua, in which it had to determine whether the acts of the contras, an armed non-State opposition group, could be attributed to the United States government because of State support for the operations of the group.²³ In broad terms, the\n\n20 Prosecutor v Duško Tadić, 15 July 1999, ICTY, Appeals Chamber Judgment, para. 97.\n21 Ibid para. 98.\n22 Ibid para. 99, 105.\n23 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, 27 July 1986, ICJ, Judgment on the merits, para. 109.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348",
    "THOGERSEN\n\njudgment articulates two coexisting tests of control leading to the attribution of acts of non-State actors to a State. The first test, which Milanovic names the test of complete control, implies that the relationship between a State and a non-State group must be so much one of dependence on one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the group either with an organ of the State or as acting on its behalf.²⁴ The judgment suggests a list of criteria indicating whether this requirement is met, which essentially revolves around the requirement that the dependent group have no real autonomy from the controlling State.²⁵ If this test is met, then the actions of the group are generally attributable to a State. Consequently, no assessment of the degree of State involvement in specific operations is necessary. The second test articulated by the ICJ is subsidiary in nature, as it becomes relevant once the test of complete control is not fulfilled. It sets up criteria for the establishment of State control over the conduct of a specific operation in the course of which violations have been committed. The test implies a high threshold of control; State participation in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the non-State actor, the selection of its targets and the planning of the whole of its operation is insufficient in itself for the purpose of attribution. The Court emphasizes that these measures do not imply that the acts of the non-State actor could not have been committed without the assistance of the State and, against this background, articulates the need for effective control.²⁶\n\nIn the case of Tadić, when the ICTY was to consider the substantial requirements of attribution for the purpose of State responsibility, with a view to applying those requirements for conflict classification, it initially looked toward the approach taken by the ICJ in Nicaragua. In contrast to the analysis laid out above,²⁷ the ICTY does not read the Nicaragua judgment as containing two tests of control. Rather, it interprets the propounding of effective control as the substantial requirements under the first test, that is, that of dependence and control (in the terminology of Milanovic, the test of complete control²⁸). Based on this reading, the ICTY found the approach of the ICJ unpersuasive.²⁹ Instead, it articulated its own test. The ICTY found that the degree of control\n\n²⁴ Ibid 109–110; M.

For individuals, and for groups that are not militarily organized, it is necessary to prove not only that the State exercised some measure of authority over those individuals but also that it issued specific instructions to them concerning the performance of the acts at issue, or that it ex post facto publicly endorsed those acts.³⁰ In contrast, for individuals making up an organized and hierarchically structured group, such as a military unit or, in case of war or civil strife, armed bands of irregulars or rebels, it suffices to prove that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. The ICTY elaborates that this comprises more than the mere provision of financial assistance or military equipment or training, but does not go so far as to include the issuing of specific orders by the State, or its direction of each individual operation.³¹ As such, it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts.³² With this approach, the level of organization of the armed group becomes vital for the degree of involvement required from a State over the group before the actions of the group can trigger an IAC.\n\nIn the case of Genocide, the ICJ rejects the conceptual basis on which the ICTY has built its argumentation, as it finds that logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the question of State involvement required to establish State responsibility and the question of State involvement in an armed conflict for the conflict to be characterized as international.³³ Moreover, substantially, the ICJ rejects the Tadić-approach for attribution for State responsibility, as it finds that it broadens the scope of State responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility.³⁴ As for the utility of the Tadić-approach for conflict classification, the ICJ holds that “it may well be that the test is applicable and suitable”. As such, while rejecting the conceptual basis on which the approach was articulated, the ICJ leaves open the question of the substantial appropriateness of the criteria for conflict classification.\n\n³⁰ Ibid 118, 137.\n³¹ Ibid 137.\n³² Ibid 121, 131.\n³³ Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) 11 July 1996, ICJ Judgment, para. 404.\n³⁴ Ibid para. 405.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348",
    "THOGERSEN\n\nSince then, the majority of scholars and States have substantially accepted the approach of the ICTY for conflict classification, while resorting to the approach of the ICJ for State responsibility. Therefore, relevant for the present purpose is the substantial approach taken by the ICTY, according to which the organizational structure of the group is decisive for the level of control required from the State over the non-State group for the triggering of an IAC.\n\nIn conclusion, non-State armed groups have the ability to trigger either a NIAC or an IAC. Classifying the conflict in question is the first step in any analysis under IHL, since the nature of the conflict determines the applicable legal regime. Both the triggering provisions of the Geneva Conventions, that is, CA2 and CA3, have been interpreted as requiring a certain level of organization of a non-State group. Moreover, APII, which extends the rules applicable to NIACS, contains an organization requirement in the text of the Convention. In contrast to the explicit organization requirement in APII, the requirements on organization in the application of CA2 and CA3 are not rooted in the text of the provisions, but have been developed in the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Notably, it is somewhat inaccurate to speak of a requirement on organization under CA2, since a non-organized group may also trigger an IAC if it acts under the specific instructions of a State. Apart from this nuance, the requirements appear remarkably similar. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (the Tallinn Manual 2.0) has suggested that the considerations regarding the nature of virtual groups in relation to the requirement on organization in CA3 are equally relevant in the context of GCIII Article 4A, out of which the CA2-criterion was arguably born.³⁵ Whether the same considerations are indeed relevant with regards to the application of the organization requirement under the different triggering provisions to virtual groups are explored in section 4.\n\n## 3 Applying a Requirement on Organization to Virtual Groups\n\nAs section 2 demonstrates, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger an armed conflict. However, non-State groups operating in cyberspace have the potential to implement fundamentally different organizational structures than kinetic groups: Virtual groups may have the technical capacity to coordinate and conduct operations without their members meeting physically. This does not mean that no coordination\n\n³⁵ MN.

Whether acknowledged or not by hackers themselves, all types of hacking embody profound forms of social entanglement and feelings of communion. These elements are established by a mutual adoration of technical pursuits and the pragmatic need to secure the help of others; crucially, the collective development of technology is bolstered by social spaces, and hackers have long had and continue to build and inhabit many of these – mailing lists and image boards, code repositories, free software projects, hacker and maker spaces, Internet chat relays, and developer and hacker conferences.³⁶\n\nThus, virtual groups often find ways of collaborating, motivated by the potential to increase capacity through the help of others. Such collaboration may take the form of hacking collectives or networks of likeminded individuals. At the same time, this type of collaboration by no means ensures predictability or entails any measures of control over individual members. Cyberspace enables the quick formation of virtual groups with the ability to coordinate and conduct collective activities without leadership, a formal hierarchy, or a chain of command, and with no geographical boundaries. Those features imply that virtual groups carrying those characteristics are unlikely to be perceived as organized in the sense of CA2, CA3 and APII. Therefore, upholding an emphasis on organization for those groups implies that they are unlikely to trigger an armed conflict.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, a challenge when applying an organization criterion in cyberspace is that it is technically difficult – and sometimes maybe impossible – for the victim of a hostile operation to gain sufficient knowledge on the organizational structure of the author group to determine whether it meets the required threshold to trigger a conflict.³⁷ The attribution problem in cyberspace is generally well known, but the emphasis on organization for the triggering of an armed conflict implies a further challenge for military commanders and legal advisers, as they must have intelligence on the organizational structure of the attacker to know what legal framework the operations must conform to. For these reasons, upholding the organization\n\n³⁶ G.

It does so by testing the plasticity in the requirements, that is, the extent to which the legal norms allow for modifications of the requirements when reality changes. International law must be interpreted in accordance with the principles laid out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\nThus, the triggering provisions must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. The context includes any subsequent agreement and any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty establishing the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. CA2 and CA3 are distinguishable from APII Article 1(1) in that no organization requirements are contained in the former two provisions, but have been subsequently developed in the application of the provisions. Thus, they are the result of an interpretation of the treaty, and the room – and need – for a reinterpretation depends on whether the link between the organization requirements and the legal sources are still valid in the light of a rapidly changing reality among non-State groups in cyberspace. Answering this question requires a dissection of the legal norms to understand the rationales behind the requirements on organization.\n\n## 4.1 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA3\n\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.1, no organization requirement is present in the text of CA3. Instead, it was developed by international tribunals in their interpretation of the provision. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 reiterates the requirement on organization in its application of CA3 to cyberspace. A majority of the IGE agreed that the failure of the members to meet physically does not alone preclude groups operating purely virtually from having the requisite degree of organization.

    "VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n341\n\nCA3, the manual states the rationale behind the requirement on organization is that it must be possible for the group to comply with IHL. No other possible rationales for organization are explicitly considered (although some of the indicating factors taken into consideration in the assessment of the organization requirement indeed point to other rationales). However, in fact, not only one but three possible rationales for an organization requirement can be deduced from the text of the Convention and identified in the practice of international tribunals. The rationales are reflected in different indicative factors for organization.\n\n## 4.1.1 The First Rationale: Intensity of the Conflict\n\nOne rationale for the requirement of organization can be deduced from the text of the provision, as the term “armed conflict” has in itself been interpreted to suggest the existence of hostilities of a certain intensity.³⁹ The requisite intensity of hostilities may depend on the armed group being organized to a certain degree.⁴⁰ The ICTY has found the criteria of organization and intensity to be closely related, and in the ICRC commentary to CA3 both criteria are considered sub-criteria to determine whether the hostilities are above the requisite threshold.⁴¹ The 2008 Report of the International Law Association’s Use of Force Committee suggests that “[t]he criteria of organization and intensity are clearly related and should be considered together when assessing whether a particular situation amounts to an armed conflict. It seems that the higher the level of organization the less degree of intensity may be required and vice versa.”⁴² Based on this rationale, relevant indicia for organization include the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations. In the same vein, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 emphasizes the ability to conduct sustained military operations as relevant indicia for organization.⁴³ Measuring virtual groups based on indicia for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, some virtual groups may have good prospects for meeting them. Indeed, cyber operations usually occur\n\n³⁹ Prosecutor v Jean-Paul Akayesu, 2 September 1998, ICTR, Chamber 1 Judgment ICTR-96-4-T, para. 620.\n⁴⁰ S.

    "THOGERSEN\n\nat much lower levels of severity than kinetic operations. However, the scenario of highly destructive cyber operations meeting the threshold of protracted armed violence cannot be rejected as entirely unrealistic. A hacker's level of sophistication ultimately depends on expertise, not equipment.[44] As such, a small group of individuals, or even a single individual, can potentially cause considerable levels of harm through malicious hacking.[45] What is more, the flexibility that comes with a virtual and networked group structure may also help a group spreading across the globe.[46] Thereby, those very features may enable the group to overcome the problem of a general shortage of skilled labour in the cyber field.[47] Accordingly, based on indicative factors for organization pointing to the intensity of operations, the virtual, networked groups could well be treated as organized for the purpose of CA3.\n\n# 4.1.2 The Second Rationale: Ability to Be a Party\n\nHowever, the intensity-rationale does not stand alone. A second possible rationale may be deduced from the requirement that there are \"parties\" to the conflict. In assessing whether a non-State group constitutes a party, a certain level of organization may provide an indication that the violence is of a collective character, rather than being carried out by random individuals; thus, a requirement on organization is a way of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to IHL.[48] The ICTY has held that an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means. State governmental authorities have been presumed to dispose of armed forces that satisfy this criterion.[49] On the other hand, for non-State armed groups, it must be concretely assessed whether the criterion is fulfilled. Assuming such a correlation between a certain level of organization and the ability to constitute a party, an organization requirement can arguably be deduced from the notion of \"party.\"[50] With this rationale for organization, relevant indicative factors for the level of organization are: the existence of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",
    "VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n343\n\nheadquarters; the control of territory; and the ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords.⁵¹ If emphasis is placed on those indicative factors, networked and virtual groups are unlikely to be considered sufficiently organized to constitute a party, and thereby to meet the criterion on organization.\n\n## 4.1.3 The Third Rationale: Ability to Comply with IHL\n\nThe notion of parties to the conflict also brings with it responsibility on both sides.⁵² This condition points to a third possible rationale for the requirement of organization, which is also, as mentioned above, the only rationale explicitly emphasized in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. A certain level of organization is assumed necessary for the non-State party to be able to comply with the obligations of CA3.⁵³ The International Law Association Committee on the Use of Force has noted that the “underlying theme” within the requirement of organization “is that there must be a sufficient level of organization through a command structure in order for the basic requirements of [CA3] to be implemented”.⁵⁴ CA3 can only be applied to a particular factual situation if it can be applied by both parties to the armed conflict, namely the State and the armed group or both armed groups. This is a key feature of IHL, and is rooted in the principle of equality.⁵⁵ The requirement that the non-State group must have some form of responsible command and the capacity to implement IHL arguably precludes virtual groups from qualifying as organized armed groups. Members of virtual groups may be dispersed all over the globe,⁵⁶ and it would be difficult to establish an effective system of discipline within such a group to ensure respect for IHL.⁵⁷ The IGE in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 was divided as to whether the difficulty in complying with the requirement that the organization must be able to implement the law of armed conflict would bar qualification as an organized armed group.⁵⁸ Presumably, if the emphasis is put on indicative factors for organization pointing to the ability to comply with IHL, such as the existence of some form of responsible command, the existence of internal\n\n⁵¹ Haradinaj, supra note 15, para. 60; Limaj, supra note 15, para. 102.\n⁵² Sivakumaran, supra note 40.\n⁵³ Ibid 177.\n⁵⁴ International Law Association on the Use of Force, Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, The Hague Conference (2010) p. 29.\n⁵⁵ R.

    "THOGERSEN\n\ndisciplinary systems and the capacity to implement IHL, networked and virtually organized groups are precluded from qualifying as organized armed groups. However, it cannot be excluded that it would be possible to establish a virtual system of discipline that would enable the group to comply with IHL. Some virtual organizations already have systems in place for democratic decision-making, allowing group members who have conducted operations of a certain level of sophistication, to gain influence on the direction of the group.⁵⁹ Perhaps it is, theoretically, equally possible to establish a virtual system of internal sanctioning for wrongful conduct. Whether such systems would suffice to meet the criterion of having a disciplinary system that enables the compliance with IHL is uncertain.\n\nTo conclude, three rationales for the requirement on organization can be deduced from CA3. The first rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and intensity of hostilities. This rationale may allow for some plasticity in the organization requirement; for cyber operations, the level of organization is not necessarily the most relevant indicator for the ability of the group to conduct highly destructive operations. On the contrary, a loose, networked group structure may enable a group to spread across the globe and attract skilled individuals. However, this rationale does not stand alone. A second rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and the ability to be party to a conflict; a third rationale is based on an assumption about a correlation between organization and ability to ensure compliance with IHL. These two rationales are equally valid in the context of virtual groups, and applying the indicia for organization pointing to these rationales to virtual groups would lead to the conclusion that they could not be considered organized. As all three rationales can be deduced from the provision and have been applied by international criminal tribunals. Therefore, they must all be taken into consideration in the interpretation and application of CA3 to virtual groups. This leads to the conclusion that there is not room for a reinterpretation of CA3. As such, the requirement on organization must be upheld for virtual groups, and it is unlikely that such groups will be able to trigger a NIAC.\n\n## 4.2 The Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in APII\n\nIn APII, the organization requirement can be directly deduced from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty; APII, Article 1(1) establishes that to trigger the application of the Convention, the non-State party must be \"dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups\". Already for this\n\n⁵⁹ Coleman, supra note 46.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348",
    "VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n345\n\nreason, the plasticity of the requirement is presumably limited. Moreover, interestingly, all three rationales behind the organization requirement in CA3 are reflected in the wording of APII. Thus, the requirement on organization appears to be highly similar in the two provisions, albeit their legal bases are different. For the reasons stated in section 4.1, and due to the safe legal basis in the text of the Convention, there is no room for reinterpretation of the organization requirement in APII, Article 1(1).\n\n## 4.3 Plasticity in the Organization Requirement in CA2\n\nAs is apparent from the analysis in section 2.2, the road to the development of a criterion on organization in the jurisprudence on CA2 is slightly less straightforward than for CA3. As of today, the Tadić-approach is widely acknowledged by States and in the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals for the assessment of the existence of an IAC and must be considered state-of-the-art. However, the ICJ's subsequent rejection of the conceptual basis on which the approach was built makes the legal nature of the Tadić-approach uncertain. Does the approach, despite being articulated as an (erroneous) identification of the rules on State responsibility, constitute an interpretation of CA2? Alternatively, does it constitute a specific IHL rule of customary international law? To the extent that the approach constitutes an interpretation of treaty law, the subsequent endorsement of the approach may be perceived as subsequent practice in the application of the treaty, which should be taken into account in the interpretation of the treaty. To the extent that the approach constitutes a rule of customary international law, it constitutes a binding legal source in its own capacity.\n\nRegardless of the perception of the approach as subsequent practice or customary international law, it constitutes an IHL-specific rule. Moreover, several treaty rules under IHL have the status of customary law, and attempting to make a clear distinction between the evolvement of the two types of legal norms is beyond the scope of this article. The continued relevance of organization depends, either way, on whether the rationale behind the emphasis holds in the context of cyberspace. Accordingly, the next step is to identify the rationale behind the emphasis on organizational structures, which must be found in the argumentation of the Appeals Chamber. As noted above, it found that the question of when a non-State armed group was fighting on behalf of a State should be informed by the standard laid out in Article 4A of the Third Geneva Convention, establishing when members of non-State armed forces participating in an IAC may gain combatant status. This provision requires that the group \"belongs to\" a State, which according to the ICTY implies a test of control. The ICTY resorts to the rules on State responsibility\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",

With its finding that the rules on State responsibility require a distinction between organized and non-organized groups, the ICTY deviates from the test of control articulated by the ICJ, which is today widely acknowledged for State responsibility. Regardless of the perception of the ICTY that it was a reflection of general international law on State responsibility, reality is that the test, and its logic, is IHL -specific. The rationale behind the distinction between organized and hierarchically structured groups and, on the other hand, individuals and groups not sufficiently organized is that IHL is a \"realistic body of law\", not grounded on formalistic postulates.⁶⁰ This notion implies that a formal position of authority is not crucial for the legal characterization of a certain act.⁶¹ An organized group differs from an individual in that the former normally has a structure, a chain of command and a set of rules as well as the outward symbols of authority. Members of the group normally do not act on their own but conform to the standards prevailing in the group and are subject to the authority of the head of the group.⁶² Regardless of the absence of formal recognition as a State organ, if a non-State armed group resembles as a group forming part of the State's armed forces, the acts of such a group should be treated in the same way under IHL as the act of the State. As such, the rationale behind the delimitation of the scope of application of the test of overall control to organized armed groups is that individuals and insufficiently organized groups do not resemble a group forming part of the State's armed forces. This rationale is closely connected to the nature of IHL and is, as such, a relevant consideration, regardless of whether one considers the Tadić-approach an interpretation of treaty law or an IHL -specific rule of customary international law. Consequently, despite the conceptual confusion that the complicated jurisprudential history has brought with it, the rationale of the Appeals Chamber for the emphasis on organization remains relevant.\n\nApplied to cyberspace, the rationale implies that a general change in the way that non-State actors organize in the digital domain is not sufficient to allow for plasticity in the organization requirement. What matters is that the non-State group resembles a group of the State. As such, as long as the State's armed forces remain organized, so must non-State groups for the test of overall control to be applicable. However, in the case of States' armed forces, in particular their cyber armies, starting to loosen their organizational structure,\n\n⁶⁰ Tadić, supra note 20, para. 96.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid., para. 120.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329–348",
    "VIRTUAL GROUPS AND THE TRIGGERING OF ARMED CONFLICTS\n347\n\nthe organization requirement for non-State actors for the applicability of the test of overall control should be affected.\n\n# 5 Conclusion\n\nThis article has examined how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict in light of the emphasis in the triggering provisions on the organizational structure of non-State groups. To set the scene, section 2 introduced the legal framework determining when an armed conflict is triggered. In the NIAC realm, which has the most obvious relevance when a non-State group is involved, two categories of NIACs exist. It was concluded that in both categories, a certain level of organization of the non-State group is required for the triggering of a conflict. As for the first category of NIACs, that is, those regulated in CA3, the organization requirement has been developed in the case-law of international criminal tribunals. As for the second category of NIACs, that is, those NIACs that (moreover) satisfy the requirements for the application of APII, an organization requirement appears directly in the text of the APII, Article 1(1). Despite CA2 defining an IAC as an armed conflict between two or more States, the hostile activities of a non-State group against a State may also trigger an IAC. This requires that the group is acting on behalf of a State. In this determination, the organizational structure is decisive: an organized armed group is only required to be under the overall control of a State, whereas an individual or a non-organized armed group must receive specific instructions from the State. As such, in all categories of armed conflicts, the organizational structure of a non-State group is decisive for its ability to trigger a conflict.\n\nSection 3 reflected on the characteristics of virtual groups and on the consequences of applying an organization requirement to those groups. It was concluded that virtual groups often fall short of meeting these requirements. Against this background, section 4 examined the plasticity in the organization requirement under the triggering provisions by dissecting their legal foundations. Under CA3, three rationales for organization were identified: the ability to conduct operations of a certain intensity; the ability to be a party to the conflict; and the ability to ensure compliance with IHL. While the first rationale could potentially be challenged by virtual groups, the latter two rationales were equally valid for virtual groups. As such, there was no room for a reinterpretation of the organization requirement in CA3. The organization requirement under APII, Article 1(1) was deduced directly from the text of the Convention, which also contained rationales similar to CA3. Thus, there was no room for reinterpretation this provision either. The examination of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348",

However, the section concluded that the rationale behind the emphasis on organization is that the group should resemble an organ of the State. The factual change that would be needed before the emphasis on organization could not be upheld is a change in the organization of the States' cyber organs, which is yet to be seen.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 329-348"

    "abstract": "The article examines how virtual groups can trigger an armed conflict, and thus, the application of international humanitarian law (IHL). The emergence of non-State actors as central players in cyberspace, together with the increasing use of cyber operations in conflicts, makes the regulation of non-State actors in armed conflicts a topical issue. The triggering provisions in IHL require a level of organization of non-State groups, which do not necessarily resonate with the realities among virtual groups. To determine if the triggering provisions allow for a reinterpretation to fit better the potentially differently structured virtual groups, the article scrutinizes the legal bases for the organization requirements in the respective provisions and identifies the underlying rationales. The article concludes that the legal bases for the organization requirement in the three provisions are distinct, but that none of them currently allows for reinterpretation.",
